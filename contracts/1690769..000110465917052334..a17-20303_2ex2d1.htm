(including a working interest in Oil and Gas Properties) or all or

2.6 **_Contribution Price Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) The Contributor and Buyer shall cooperate and shall (in the case of the
Contributor, prior to the Closing and, in the case of Buyer, from and after
Closing) exercise commercially reasonable efforts to provide each other access
to the books, records and employees of the Alta Mesa Entities, during normal

containing the Contributors good faith estimates, in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, of (i) the Closing Debt (the " ** _Debt Estimate_** "),
and (ii) the Transaction Expenses (the " ** _Transaction Expenses Estimate_**
"), together with reasonable supporting information and calculations.

 



 

(b) The " ** _Estimated Adjustment Amount_** ," shall mean an amount equal to
(A) the Debt Estimate, _plus_ (B) the Transaction Expenses Estimate.

 



 

(c) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver a
statement (the " ** _Closing Date Statement_** ") containing Buyers good
faith calculation of (i) the Closing Debt, and (ii) Transaction Expenses,
together with reasonable supporting information and calculations. The Closing
Date Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
If the Contributor objects to the Closing Date Statement, then they shall
provide Buyer with written notice thereof within 30 days after the
Contributors receipt of the Closing Date Statement and shall include
reasonable detail regarding such specific objections together with supporting
documentation. If Buyer and the Contributor fail to agree on such disputed
items contained in the Closing Date Statement within thirty (30) days from
delivery by the Contributor to Buyer of the Contributors objection notice,
then any Party may refer such dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, and
the Parties shall direct the Independent Accounting Firm to make a final and
binding determination as to all matters in dispute (and only such matters) on
a timely basis (and in any event within sixty (60) days after its engagement)
and to promptly notify the Parties

 



      
 

 



 

in writing of its resolution; _provided_ that the Parties shall not permit the
Independent Accounting Firm to assign a value to any particular item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by any Party or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by any Party (except to the extent that the
resolution of a disputed item results in a corresponding change to any other
item). The Independent Accounting Firm shall not have the power to modify or
amend any term or provision of this Agreement. Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Contributor, on the other hand, shall each bear and pay one-half of the fees
and other costs charged by the Independent Accounting Firm. If the Contributor
does not object to the Closing Date Statement within the time period and in
the manner set forth in the third sentence of this _Section 2.6(c)_ or if the
Contributor accepts the Closing Date Statement, the Closing Debt and the
Transaction Expenses as set forth on the Closing Date Statement shall become
final and binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder. If the
Contributor does object to the Closing Date Statement within the time period
and in the manner set forth in the third sentence of this _Section 2.6(c)_,
then the Closing Date Statement shall become final and binding for all
purposes hereunder except with respect to, and only to the extent of, those
matters expressly objected to by the Contributor in such objection; _provided_
that where any matter to which the Contributor expressly objects would, if
decided in the Contributors favor, warrant an adjustment to any other amount
set forth on the Closing Date Statement, then notwithstanding the foregoing,
such other amount shall become final and binding only after the matter to
which the Contributor expressly objects has been resolved and all applicable
adjustments necessarily stemming therefrom have been made. The Closing Debt as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall be referred
to as the " ** _Final Closing Debt_** " and the Transaction Expenses as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall be referred
to as the " ** _Final Transaction Expenses_** _._ " Each of the Contribution
Price adjustments contained in this _Section 2.6_ shall be calculated in a
manner as to avoid double counting any item.

 



 

(d) The " ** _Adjustment Amount_** ", which may be positive or negative, shall
mean the amount equal to (A) Estimated Closing Debt _minus_ the Final Closing
Debt, _plus_ (B) the Estimated Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Final
Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Buyer shall cause the
Partnership to issue to the Contributor within five Business Days after such
amount is so agreed or determined (the " ** _Adjustment Determination Date_**
") a number of Common Units (rounded up or down to the nearest whole Common
Unit) equal to the Adjustment Amount _divided by_ $10.00. In addition, Buyer
shall issue to Contributor, a number of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock
equal to the number of Common Units issued to the Contributor pursuant to this
_Section 2.6(d)(i)_, and the Contributor shall separately pay Buyer an amount
of cash equal to the number of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock received
pursuant to this _Section 2.6(d)(i)_ multiplied by the par value of such
shares.

 



 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number (the absolute value of such
number, the " ** _Contributor Adjustment Amount_** "), then, within five
Business Days after the Adjustment Determination Date:

 



 

(A) if the Contributor Adjustment Amount does not exceed the value of the
Reserved Units on the Adjustment Determination Date (as calculated in
accordance with _clause (e)_ below), (x) the Contributor shall transfer a
number of

 



      
 

 



 

Reserved Units (rounded up or down to the nearest whole Reserved Unit) with a
value equal to the Contributor Adjustment Amount to Buyer and Buyer and the
Partnership shall cancel such Reserved Units and (y) Buyer and the Partnership
shall cause the Restrictive Legend on any remaining Reserved Units to be
removed and the Contributor shall be permitted to transfer such Reserved Units
in accordance with the AandR LP Agreement; and

 



 

(B) if the Contributor Adjustment Amount exceeds the value of the Reserved
Units on the Adjustment Determination Date (as calculated in accordance with
_clause (e)_ below), then (x) the Contributor shall transfer all of the
Reserved Units to Buyer and Buyer and the Partnership shall cancel such
Reserved Units and (y) the Contributor shall transfer an additional number of
Common Units (rounded up or down to the nearest whole Common Unit) received by
the Contributor pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ with a value on the
Adjustment Determination Date (as calculated in accordance with _clause (e)_
below) equal to the Contributor Adjustment Amount _less_ the value of the
Reserved Units on the Adjustment Determination Date and a corresponding number
of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock.

 



 

(e) On the Adjustment Determination Date, the value of a Common Unit shall be
$10.00 per Common Unit. For purposes of calculating the value of the Reserved
Units, all value shall be ascribed to the Common Units and no value shall be
ascribed to the shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock.

 



 

2.7 **_Earn-Out Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the seven-
year anniversary of the Closing Date,

 



 

(i) promptly and in any event within 5 Business Days after the first date that
the 20-Day VWAP equals or exceeds $14.00, Buyer shall cause the Partnership to
issue 10,714,285 Common Units to the Contributor;

 



 

(ii) promptly and in any event within 5 Business Days after the first date
that the 20-Day VWAP equals or exceeds $16.00, Buyer shall cause the
Partnership to issue 9,375,000 Common Units to the Contributor;

 



 

(iii) promptly and in any event within 5 Business Days after the first date
that the 20-Day VWAP equals or exceeds $18.00, Buyer shall cause the
Partnership to issue 13,888,889 Common Units to the Contributor; and

 



 

(iv) promptly and in any event within 5 Business Days after the first date
that the 20-Day VWAP equals or exceeds $20.00, Buyer shall cause the
Partnership to issue 12,500,000 Common Units to the Contributor (each issuance
of Common Units pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, an
**_"Earn-Out Payment"_** and all Earn-Out Payments, collectively, the
**_"Earn-Out Consideration"_** ).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In the event that the Partnership shall issue any Common Units in
satisfaction of an Earn-Out Payment, Buyer shall issue to the Contributor, a
number of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock equal to the number of Common
Units so issued and the Contributor shall separately pay Buyer an amount of
cash equal to the number of shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock received
multiplied by the par value of such shares. The right to receive the Earn-Out
Consideration shall be transferrable on a share-by-share basis by the
Contributor to the same extent that the Common Units and shares of Buyer Class
C Common Stock received by the Contributor pursuant to this Agreement are
transferrable by them; provided that the Contributor and such transferees
shall deliver notice to Buyer indicating the Common Units and shares of Buyer
Class C Common Stock such transferee may be entitled to receive and an
undertaking to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates in the event of any dispute
among any Contributor or any such transferee or other Affiliate of the
Contributor or transferee with respect to any such transfer or the Common
Units and/or shares of Buyer Class C Common Stock to be delivered in
accordance therewith.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the Contributor shall
not be entitled to receive a particular Earn-Out Payment on more than one
occasion, and (ii) in the event that, on a particular date, the 20-Day VWAP
entitles the Contributor to more than one Earn-Out Payment (each of which has
not previously been paid), the Contributor shall be entitled to receive each
such Earn-Out Payment.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, **_"Liquidity Event Consideration"_**
means the amount per share to be received by a holder of shares of Buyer Class
A Common Stock in connection with a Liquidity Event, with any non-cash
consideration valued as determined by the value ascribed to such consideration
by the parties to such transaction. In the event that the Liquidity Event
Consideration is greater than the 20-Day VWAP hurdle with respect to any Earn-
Out Payment not previously paid, then the corresponding Earn-Out Payment shall
be made, and the applicable Common Units shall be deemed issued and
outstanding, effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Liquidity
Event and the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the corresponding
Liquidity Event Consideration. Thereafter, the Buyer shall cease to have any
further obligation under _Section 2.7(a)_ or this _Section 2.7(d)_. Any such
Earn-Out Payment shall not be paid or payable in the event such Liquidity
Event is not consummated and the Buyer will continue to have the obligations
set forth in this _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(e) If, prior to the termination of Buyers obligation to make any Earn-Out
Payment, any change in the outstanding shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend, the Earn-Out Payments and 20-Day VWAP targets
set forth above shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change and to
provide to the Contributor the same economic effect as contemplated by this
_Section 2.7(a) _prior to such change.

 



 

2.8 **_Withholding_**. Buyer and the Partnership shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Contributor such amounts as Buyer or the Partnership, as
applicable, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax law,
with respect to the making of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer and Partnership shall notify the Contributor of any amounts expected to
be deducted and

 



      
 

 



 

withheld at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and the
basis for such deduction and withholding. Buyer or Partnership, as applicable,
shall reasonably cooperate with the Contributor to reduce or eliminate any
deductions and withholdings. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

relating to the Alta Mesa Real Property.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.17(b)_ , and except as has not had and
would not be reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate,
a material Liability to the Alta Mesa Entities, there exists no default by any
Alta Mesa Entity, or, to the Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, any other
party under any Real Property Lease and, to the Knowledge of the Alta Mesa
Parties, no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute such a default or permit the revocation, termination or
material and adverse modification of, or acceleration of payments due under,
any Real Property Lease.

 



 

(c) Other than the Oil and Gas Properties, which are addressed in _Section
4.18_, each Alta Mesa Entity owns and possesses, of record and beneficially,
(i) good and defensible title to all owned Alta Mesa Real Property, and (ii)
good and defensible leasehold interest to all leased, subleased or licensed
Alta Mesa Real Property, in each case, free and clear of all Liens, except for
Permitted Liens.

 



 

(d) Other than the Oil and Gas Properties, which are addressed in _Section
4.18_, _Schedule 4.17(d)_ contains a true and correct list of each material
right-of-way, easement, servitude, license, franchise, fee interest, lease,
surface lease, surface use and similar non-possessory interests in which any
Alta Mesa Entity owns or has an interest as of the Execution Date
(collectively, the " ** _Easements_** "). Each Alta Mesa Entity owns good and
defensible title to the Easements. The Alta Mesa Entities have all material
Easements as are necessary for the ownership and operation of the Assets. Each
of the Easements is in full force and effect in all material respects, and is
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Alta Mesa Entities and, to the
Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, is the legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of the counterparties thereto subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, arrangement, moratorium and
other similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally,
and general equitable principles. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.17(d)_ ,
there exists no material default by any Alta Mesa Entity, or to the Knowledge
of the Alta Mesa Parties, any other party under any Easement (and, to the
Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, no event has occurred which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default or, to the
Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, would otherwise permit the revocation,
limitation, termination or material and adverse modification of, or
acceleration of payments due under, the Easements) by any Alta Mesa Entity or,
to the Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, any other party under any Easement.
Except for matters that are being contested in good faith and for which
reserves have been established in the Financial Statements, each Alta Mesa
Entity has fulfilled and performed all of its prior and current obligations
with respect to the Easements,

 



      
 

 



 

including the timely and full payment of all amounts currently due and owing
to the counterparties of the Easements.

 



 

4.18 **_Oil and Gas Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Except as would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise disposed of in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the reserve report audited by

relating to Alta Mesas interests referred to therein as of December 31, 2016
(the " ** _Reserve Report_** ") or (ii) reflected in the Reserve Report as
having been sold or otherwise disposed of, the Alta Mesa Entities own good and
defensible title to all material Oil and Gas Properties reflected in the
Reserve Report and in each case as attributable to interests owned by the Alta
Mesa Entities. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible
title" means that an Alta Mesa Entitys title to each of the Oil and Gas
Properties held or owned by it (or purported to be held or owned by it as
reflected in the Reserve Report) (i) entitles Alta Mesa (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all Production
Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest share
shown in the Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas
Properties throughout the life of such Oil and Gas Properties, (ii) obligates
Alta Mesa (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a
percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance and development of,
and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than
the working interest shown on the Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas
Properties (other than any positive differences in such percentage) and the
applicable working interest shown on the Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas
Properties that are accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue
interest in such Oil and Gas Properties and (iii) is free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

 



 

(b) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a material Liability to the Alta Mesa
Entities, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied by Alta Mesa to the
Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to Alta Mesas interests referred to
in the Reserve Report, by or on behalf of the Alta Mesa Entities that was
material to such firms audit of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to
the Oil and Gas Properties of the Alta Mesa Entities included in the Reserve
Report was, as of the time provided, to the Knowledge of the Alta Mesa
Entities, accurate in all material respects. To the Knowledge of the Alta Mesa
Parties, there are no material errors in the assumptions and estimates
provided by the Alta Mesa Entities in connection with the preparation of the
Reserve Report. Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the

have been properly and timely paid in all material respects, (i) all
royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and other Production
Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas

 



      
 

 



 

Properties owned or held by the Alta Mesa Entities have been timely and
properly paid in all material respects, (ii) no Alta Mesa Entity (and, to the
Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, no third party operator) has violated any
provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice,
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any
Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate
such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held
by the Alta Mesa Entities and (iii) no Alta Mesa Entity has received written
notice from any other party to any such Oil and Gas Lease that any Alta Mesa
Entity is in breach or default under any Oil and Gas Lease.

 



 

(d) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Alta Mesa Entities are being received by them in a timely
manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason other than (i)

recently drilled wells or (ii) as may be permitted by applicable Law, in each
case, except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
Liability to the Alta Mesa Entities.

 



 

(e) All (i) burdens with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties have been
properly and timely paid in all material respects in accordance with
applicable Laws and Orders and the terms of the Oil and Gas Leases, and (ii)
all expenses payable by the Alta Mesa Entities under the terms of any Contract
have been properly and timely paid in all material respects except, in each
case, for such burdens and expenses as are being currently paid prior to
delinquency in the ordinary course of business and except for matters that are
being contested in good faith and for which reserves have been established in
the Financial Statements.

 



 

(f) All Hydrocarbon, water, CO2, injection or other wells located on, under or
within any of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Alta Mesa Entities or
otherwise associated with any Oil and Gas Properties of the Alta Mesa
Entities, in each case, whether producing, non-producing, permanently or
temporarily plugged and abandoned, have been drilled, completed and operated
within the limits permitted by the applicable Oil and Gas Lease and any
Contracts, and no such wells (i) are subject to any order from any
Governmental Authority or written notice pursuant to a Contract from any other
third party requiring that such well be plugged and abandoned, (ii) all wells
required to be plugged and abandoned by applicable Law have been plugged and
abandoned in accordance with applicable Law, or (iii) are subject to penalties

Agreement, there is no outstanding authorization for expenditure or similar
request or invoice for funding or participation under any agreement or
contract which is binding on any Alta Mesa Entity or any Oil and Gas
Properties and which Alta Mesa reasonably anticipates will individually
require expenditures by any Alta Mesa Entity in excess of $1,000,000.

 



 

(i) No Alta Mesa Entity is obligated by virtue of a prepayment or advance
payment arrangement, make up right under a production sales contract
containing a "take or pay" or

 



      
 

 



 

similar provision, production payment or any other arrangement (other than gas
balancing arrangements) to deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds from the sale
thereof, attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of such Person at some
future time without then or thereafter receiving the full contract price
therefor.

 



 

(j) No Alta Mesa Entity has received any notice of any pending, and, to the
Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, there is no threatened, proceeding to
condemn or take by power of eminent domain all or any of the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Alta Mesa Entities.

business in the manner in which it is currently owned and operated except as
would not be reasonably likely to result in a material Liability to the Alta
Mesa Entities. All such Permits are in full force and effect, there are no
Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Alta Mesa Parties, threatened
in writing that could reasonably be expected to result in the suspension,
revocation or material adverse modification of any such Permit. Each Alta Mesa
Entity is in compliance in all material respects with each such Permit.

 



 

4.21 **_Environmental Matters_**.

(i) each Alta Mesa Entity is and for the past three years has been in

or, except as required by applicable Law, a Benefit Plan that provides post-
termination or retiree health or welfare benefits to any Person.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 4.22(b)_ identifies each material Benefit Plan providing
compensation or benefits to any current or former individual service provider
of an Alta Mesa Entity with respect to such individuals service to such Alta
Mesa Entity, including any equity or equity-based incentive plans or programs

forms, reports, schedules and statements required to be filed or furnished
under the 1933 Act or the Exchange Act (such forms, reports, schedules and
statements, the " ** _Buyer SEC Documents_** "). As of their respective dates,
each of the Buyer SEC Documents, as amended (including, without limitation,
all financial statements included therein, exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein), complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such Buyer SEC Documents, and none of the Buyer SEC Documents
contained, when filed or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as
of the date of such amendment with respect to those disclosures that are
amended, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. To the Knowledge of Buyer, as of the date hereof, (A) none of
the Buyer SEC Documents are the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding
SEC comment and (B) neither the SEC nor any other Governmental Authority is
conducting any investigation or review of any Buyer SEC Document. No notice of

including all notes and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects,
when filed or if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date
of such amendment, with the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of
Regulation S-X of the SEC) and fairly present in all material respects in

dates and the results of operations and the cash flows of Buyer and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, for the periods presented therein.

 



 

(c) Buyer has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the listing standards of
NASDAQ. Buyers disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Buyer in the
reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,

Governmental Authority and Buyer is not subject to, and no Asset of Buyer is
bound or affected by, any outstanding orders, writs, judgments, injunctions,
decrees, stipulations, determinations or awards entered by or with any
Governmental Authority.

 



 

5.10 **_Compliance with Laws and Orders_**. Each of Buyer and the Partnership
is and since its respective date of formation has been in compliance in all
material respects with all Laws and Orders applicable to it except where such
non-compliance would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
Liability to Buyer or the Partnership.

 



 

5.11 **_Brokers_**. Neither Buyer nor the Partnership has any liability or
obligation to pay fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with
respect to the Transactions.

Redemption Right, will have immediately prior to the Closing) at least $995
million in the Trust Account, with such funds invested in United States
Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and held in
trust by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement is
in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer
and the Trustee, enforceable in accordance with its terms. As of the date
hereof, the Trust Agreement has not been terminated, repudiated, rescinded,
amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and no such termination,
repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is
contemplated. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters and (except for
the Trust Agreement) there are no agreements, contracts, arrangements or
understandings, whether written or oral, with the Trustee or any other Person
that would (i) cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the SEC
Documents to be inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) entitle any Person
(other than holders of Buyer Class A Common Stock who shall have exercised
their Buyer Stockholder Redemption Right) to any portion of the proceeds in
the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released except (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any
interest income earned in the Trust Account and (B) to redeem shares of Buyer
Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Buyer Stockholder Redemption Right. As of
the date hereof, there are no Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, threatened with respect to the Trust Account.

 



 

5.13 **_Information Supplied; Proxy Statement_**. The information supplied or
to be supplied by Buyer for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at the
time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of Buyer and at
the time of any meeting of Buyers stockholders to be held in connection with
the Transactions, contain any untrue statement of a

 



      
 

 



 

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
(other than with respect to information supplied by the Contributor or the
Alta Mesa Entities for inclusion therein) will comply in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to the Proxy Statement.

 



 

5.14 **_Absence of Certain Changes or Events_**. Since March 31, 2017 through
the date hereof, there has not been any Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Buyer nor the Partnership has conducted any business other than its formation,

making of public reports under the Exchange Act and the search for, and
preparation for the execution of, a business combination.

 



 

5.15 **_No Default_**. Neither Buyer nor Partnership is in default or
violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of Buyer or Partnership, (ii)
any Contract to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer is bound, or (iii)
any Law applicable to Buyer, except, in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii),
for defaults or violations which would not be reasonably likely to have
consequences that would, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
Buyer.

 



 

5.16 **_Listing_**. The issued and outstanding shares of Buyer Class A Common
Stock, the Buyer Warrants, and the Buyer units (consisting of one share of
Buyer Class A Common Stock and one-third of one Buyer Warrant) (the foregoing,
collectively, the " ** _Buyer Public Securities_** ") are registered pursuant
to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for trading on NASDAQ.
There is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer by NASDAQ or the SEC with respect
to any intention by such entity to deregister any Buyer Public Securities or
prohibit or terminate the listing of any Buyer Public Securities on NASDAQ.
Buyer has taken no action that is designed to terminate the registration of
Buyer Public Securities under the Exchange Act. Buyer has not received any
written or, to Buyers Knowledge, oral deficiency notice from NASDAQ relating
to the continued listing requirements of the Buyer Public Securities.

6.5 **_D andO Indemnity_**. Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Alta Mesa
Entities from and after Closing not to, amend, waive or otherwise modify the
Organizational Documents of any Alta Mesa Entity to the extent such amendment,
waiver or other modification does or would reasonably be expected to reduce,
limit, terminate or otherwise modify (in any manner adverse to any of the
Contributors Appointees, any Contributor or any of its respective Affiliates
to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent relating to the period prior to Closing) any obligation of Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries to indemnify pursuant to the Organizational Documents of
the Alta Mesa Entities the Contributors Appointees, the Contributor or its
Affiliates to the extent relating to periods prior to Closing. Buyer shall
cause the Alta Mesa Entities to, effective as of the Closing Date, obtain and
fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies that cover the existing
directors and officers of the Alta Mesa Entities for a claims-reporting or
discovery period of at least seven years from and after the Closing Date from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Alta Mesas
existing directors and officers insurance carrier and with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous
than the coverage provided under Alta Mesas existing policies with respect to
any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against any of the
Contributors Appointees by reason of his or her service as an officer or
director of any Alta Mesa Entity at or prior to the Closing Date (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Alta Mesa may not, without Buyers written consent, spend more than 300%
(the " ** _D andO Cap Amount_**") of the last annual premium paid by Alta Mesa
prior to the Execution Date per year for such coverage under such tail policy;
_provided further_ that if the cost of such insurance exceeds the DandO Cap
Amount, and the Alta Mesa Entities elect not to spend more than the DandO Cap
Amount for such purposes, then the Alta Mesa Entities shall purchase as much
coverage as is obtainable for the DandO Cap Amount which shall satisfy the
obligations of Buyer and the Alta Mesa Entities under this _Section 6.5_.
From and after the Closing, in the event that Buyer or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.5_. Buyer shall not sell, transfer, distribute or
otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to render Buyer unable to satisfy their obligations under this
_Section 6.5_.

 



 

6.6 **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) The Contributor shall prepare or cause to be prepared (i) all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Alta Mesa Entities that are due on or prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) any Tax Returns of Alta Mesa for Income Taxes that are
imposed on a "flow-through" basis and required to be filed after the Closing
Date for Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns

extent otherwise required by applicable Laws. Not later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing any such Tax Return,
the Contributor shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation, to Buyer for its reasonable comment. The Contributor
shall cause such Tax Returns (as revised to incorporate Buyers reasonable
comments) to be timely filed and will provide a copy to Buyer. Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax
Returns of the Alta Mesa Entities not specifically addressed in the first
sentence of this _Section 6.6(a)_, including all Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Alta Mesa Entities for any Tax period that begins before the
Closing Date and ends on or after the Closing Date (the " ** _Straddle
Period_** "). Such Tax Returns for a Straddle Period shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Laws. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing any such Tax Return for a Straddle Period, Buyer shall deliver a copy
of such Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Return, together with all supporting documentation, to the Contributor for its
reasonable comment. Buyer shall cause such Tax Returns for a Straddle Period
(as revised to incorporate the Contributors reasonable comments) to be timely
filed and, if requested by the Contributor, will provide a copy to the
Contributor.

 



 

(b) No amended Tax Return for Income Taxes that are imposed on a "flow-
through" basis with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be filed by or
on behalf of Alta Mesa without the consent of the Contributor, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(c) Buyer and the Contributor shall cooperate fully, and shall cause the Alta
Mesa Parties to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
Buyer or the Contributor, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
audit or Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and, upon the request of Buyer or the Contributor, the provision of
Records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer and the Contributor further agree, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on any Contributor, Buyer,
or the Alta Mesa Entities.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding herein to the contrary:

 



 

(i) Buyer and the Alta Mesa Entities, on the one hand, and the Contributor,
and their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon
receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments,
audits, Tax Proceedings or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar
event, a " ** _Tax Matter_** "); _provided_ , that Buyer and the Alta Mesa
Entities shall only be required to notify the Contributor with respect to any
Tax Matter relating to Income Taxes that are imposed on a "flow-through" basis
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any failure to so notify the other
party of a Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party from liability with
respect to such Tax Matter except to the extent such party was actually and
materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

 



 

(ii) The Contributor shall have the sole right to control any Tax Proceeding
with respect to Income Taxes imposed on a "flow-through" basis relating to any
Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, and to take any actions in
connection with such Tax Proceeding.

 



 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 6.6(d)(ii)_, Buyer shall have the right
to control all other Tax Proceedings relating to any Taxes of the Alta Mesa
Entities.

 



 

(e) In the event that any Transfer Taxes are imposed on the Transactions
(other than the Pre-Closing Reorganization), the Partnership shall be
responsible for the payment of all such Transfer Taxes. Each Contributor and
Buyer shall timely file their own Tax Returns relating to

 



      
 

 



 

Transfer Taxes as required by Law and shall notify the other Party when such
filings have been made. Each Contributor and Buyer shall cooperate and consult
with each other prior to filing such Tax Returns (i) in order to minimize such
Transfer Taxes, and (ii) to ensure that all such returns are filed in a
consistent manner.

 



 

(f) Other than any customary Tax sharing or indemnification provisions
contained in any agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business and
not primarily relating to Tax, all Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements between the Alta Mesa Entities, on the one hand, and any of the
Contributor and its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated prior
to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, no Alta Mesa Entity shall be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

(g) Intended Tax Treatment.

 



 

(i) The Parties agree that Alta Mesa will be a "disregarded entity," as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(a) immediately after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) The Parties agree that, except as required by applicable Laws, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (A) the Partnership shall be treated as a
continuation of Alta Mesa pursuant to Section 708(b)(1) of the Code; (B) the
Contributors contribution of Contributed AM Interests in exchange for Common
Units shall not be treated as a taxable exchange, (C) nonrecourse liabilities
of the Partnership shall be allocated in a manner that is consistent with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3 and Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-5T(a)(2)(i), as applicable to minimize, to the greatest extent possible,
the amount of gain that the Contributor would recognize, if any, pursuant to
Section 707 of the Code, if applicable, or Section 731(a) of the Code, as a
result of the contribution of Contributed AM Interests, (D) if applicable, any
transfer of money or other consideration to the Contributor shall be treated
as a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures in connection with the
contribution of the Contributed AM Interests to the maximum extent permitted
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d), and (E) to the extent
permitted, issuances of Earn-Out Consideration shall be treated as events
triggering an adjustment to the book value (under Section 704(b) of the Code)
of the assets of the Partnership and the corresponding capital account
adjustments shall be made in a manner determined to minimize differences
between the partners capital accounts as determined on a per Common Unit
basis. For the avoidance of doubt, except as required by applicable Law, the
Parties shall not treat (i) the purchase of Buyer Class C Stock pursuant to
Sections 2.2, 2.6 and 2.7(a), (ii) the right of a Contributor to have its
Common Units redeemed by the Partnership, (iii) the receipt of the Tax
Receivable Agreement or (iv) the receipt of the Buyer Series A Preferred
Stock, as consideration paid to the Contributor in connection with the
contribution of the Contributed AM Interests pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.707-3.

 



 

(iii) The Parties shall (A) prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with this _Section 6.6(g)_, and (B) take no position inconsistent
with this _Section 6.6(g)_ in any Tax Return, Tax Matter, Tax Proceeding or
otherwise absent a determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the
Code to the contrary.

 



 

(h) Not later than 30 days after the Closing, the parties shall cooperate in
good faith to prepare and agree to a statement reflecting a valuation of all
of the assets of the Alta Mesa

 



      
 

 



 

Entities in accordance with the principles of Sections 1060 and 755 of the
Code, as applicable (the " ** _Tax Allocation Statement_** "). The Parties
agree to (i) be bound by the Tax Allocation Statement (if agreed) and (ii) act
in accordance with the Tax Allocation Statement (if agreed) in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return.

 



 

(i) The Parties agree that the Partnership shall use the "traditional
allocation method" as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b)
(including in connection with any "reverse 704(c) allocation" that may be
required in connection with a "book-up" of the Partnerships assets in
connection with the Contributions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(j) The Contributor and Ellis acknowledge and agree that the Founder Notes are
properly treated as equity interests in Alta Mesa for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and consistent with the foregoing, the Contributor and Ellis agree
to cause Alta Mesa to treat the Founder Notes as equity interests in Alta Mesa
on the 2016 IRS Form 1065 (Return of Partnership Income) filed by Alta Mesa
(including by issuing Ellis a K-1 as payee under the Founder Notes).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Contributor and Ellis agree that the
fair market value of equity issued by Alta Mesa in connection with the
conversion, exchange and extinguishment of the Founder Notes is at least equal
to the adjusted issue price (for the avoidance of doubt, including amounts
payable in kind, whether or not previously taken into account) of the Founder
Notes, and (ii) except as required by applicable Laws, income or gain (if any)
realized by Alta Mesa associated with the conversion, exchange and
extinguishment of the Founder Notes shall be allocated to the equity owners of
Alta Mesa (other than the Riverstone Contributor) immediately prior to the
conversion. The Contributor and Ellis hereby agree, from and after the
Closing, to indemnify the Riverstone Contributor for any tax cost or Losses
arising out of or relating to the subordination of, or conversion, exchange
and extinguishment of the Founder Notes, and the Riverstone Contributor is an
express third party beneficiary of, and entitled to enforce, this provision.

 



 

(k) To the extent that the provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are inconsistent
with or conflict the provisions of _Article X_ or any other provisions under
this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall control.

 



 

6.7 **_Public Announcements; Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) No Party shall make any public announcement or issue any public
communication regarding this Agreement or the Transactions without first
obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party, except if such
announcement or other communication is required by applicable Law (including
in the Alta Mesa SEC Documents and in connection with the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement and any offering or other documents prepared in
connection with any financing by Buyer or the Alta Mesa Parties) or the rules
of any stock exchange upon which such Partys capital stock is traded, in
which case, to the extent permitted by Law, the disclosing Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate or communicate such announcement
or communication with the other Party prior to announcement or issuance;
_provided_ , _however_ that no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
restrict in any manner (i) any Partys ability to communicate with its
employees or equity holders or (ii) the ability of Buyer and the Alta Mesa
Parties to communicate with their financial and legal advisors, lenders,
underwriters or financing sources.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) From the Closing Date and for a period of five (5) years following the

such Confidential Information to any Person other than any of its respective
Affiliates or Representatives, except (x) to the extent required by Law
(provided that if required by Law, each party agrees, to the extent legally

determine) or (y) in a Claim brought by such party in the pursuit of its
remedies under this Agreement. Each Party shall (1) notify all Persons to whom

the Exchange Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Kingfisher Contribution Agreement and the Riverstone
Contribution Agreement (the " ** _Proxy Statement_** ") in preliminary form;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such 10 Business Day period shall not elapse if
Buyer provides a reasonably detailed written notice to Alta Mesa or Kingfisher
regarding information that is required but has not yet been received by Buyer
from Alta Mesa or Kingfisher for the Proxy Statement, in which case the 10
Business Day period shall re-commence after Buyer receives such information
from Alta Mesa or Kingfisher, as appropriate. Buyer shall as promptly as
practicable notify the Contributor and the Alta Mesa Entities of the receipt
of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement
and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information. Buyer shall cooperate and provide the Contributor and
the Alta Mesa Entities with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto) and all
responses to requests for additional information by and replies to comments of
the SEC and give due consideration to all comments reasonably proposed by the
Contributor and the Alta Mesa Entities in respect of such documents and
responses prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the
Parties will provide each other with copies of all such filings made and
correspondence with the SEC. The Buyer Board Recommendation shall be included
in the Proxy Statement. Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Buyer will cause the Proxy Statement to be transmitted to the
holders of Buyer Common Stock as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within 5 Business Days, following the date on which the SEC confirms it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Contributor and the Alta Mesa Entities acknowledge that a substantial
portion of the Proxy Statement and other filings to be made by Buyer with the
SEC shall include disclosure regarding the Contributor, the Alta Mesa Entities
and their management, operations and financial condition. Accordingly, the
Contributor and the Alta Mesa Entities will, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Execution Date, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with all information concerning the
Contributor, the operations of the Alta Mesa Entities business and the Alta
Mesa Entities management and operations and financial condition, in each
case, required to be included in the Proxy Statement or such other filings,
including the required financial statements of the Alta Mesa Entities prepared
in accordance with Regulation S-X and a related consent from the Alta Mesa
Entities independent public accountants. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Contributor and the Alta Mesa Entities shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in
connection with the preparation for inclusion in the Proxy Statement of pro
forma financial statements that comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X
under the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Contributor and the Alta Mesa
Entities shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause and make
their managers, directors, officers and employees of Buyer and its counsel in
connection with the drafting of the Proxy Statement and any other filings to
be made by Buyer with the SEC and responding in a timely manner to comments on
the Proxy Statement or such other filings from the SEC; _provided_ that doing
so does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Alta
Mesa Entities or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Buyer will take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ rules and the
Organizational Documents of Buyer, all action necessary to call, hold and
convene a special meeting of holders of Buyer Common Stock (including any
permitted adjournment or postponement, the " ** _Special Meeting_** ") to
consider and vote upon the Stockholder Proposals and the LTIP Proposal as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing of the Proxy Statement in
definitive form with the SEC. Once the Special Meeting to consider and vote
upon the Stockholder Proposals and the LTIP Proposal has been called and
noticed, Buyer will not postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the
consent of the Contributor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, other than, (1) for the absence of a quorum, (2) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that Buyer has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal advisors, is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated to and reviewed by the holders of Buyer Common Stock prior to the
Special Meeting or (3) an adjournment or postponement of up to 10 Business
Days to solicit additional proxies from holders of Buyer Common Stock. Subject
to _Section 6.9(d)_, Buyer will take all reasonable lawful action to solicit
approval of the Stockholder Proposals and the LTIP Proposal by the holders of
Buyer Common Stock.

 



 

(d) The Buyer Board will recommend in the Proxy Statement that the holders of
Buyer Common Stock approve the Stockholder Proposals and the LTIP Proposal
(the " ** _Buyer Board Recommendation_** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to obtaining the required stockholder approval at the Special
Meeting, the Buyer Board may withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner the
Buyer Board Recommendation (any such action a " ** _Change in
Recommendation_** ") if the Buyer Board shall have concluded in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal advisors and financial advisors,
that a failure to make a Change in

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the Buyer Board shall not be
entitled to exercise its rights to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
this sentence unless (i) such Change in Recommendation is based upon a
material intervening event (specifically excluding a change in oil and gas
prices) that occurred during the Interim Period and information not available
to the Buyer Board at the Execution Date and (ii) Buyer has provided to the
Contributor three Business Days prior written notice advising the Contributor
that the Buyer Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, any Change in
Recommendation will not (x) change the approval of this Agreement or any other
approval of the Buyer Board or (y) relieve Buyer of any of its obligations
under this Agreement, including its obligation to hold the Special Meeting.

 



 

(e) If at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event, circumstance or
information relating to Buyer, the Contributor or the Alta Mesa Entities, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors should be
discovered by Buyer, the Contributor or the Alta Mesa Entities, as applicable,
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or any other filings to be made by Buyer with the SEC, so that such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC by Buyer and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the holders of Buyer Common Stock; _provided_ that no
information received by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.9(e)_ shall operate
as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or agreement
given or made hereunder by any Party, and no such information shall be deemed
to change, supplement or amend the Schedules.

 



 

(f) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.13_, to the extent
Buyer has any assets other than its interest in the Trust Account, Buyer shall
promptly, upon request by the Alta Mesa Entities, reimburse the Alta Mesa
Entities for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Alta Mesa Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Alta Mesa Entities and
their Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 6.9_ and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Alta Mesa Entities, their Subsidiaries, the Contributor and
its Representatives and Affiliates from and against any and all losses,

connection therewith, except for Liabilities of the Alta Mesa Entities to the
extent they resulted from information provided by the Contributor or the Alta
Mesa Entities or any of their Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection
with the Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of a material fact or

11.2 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
supersede all prior discussions and agreements between the Parties and/or
their Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the
sole and entire agreement between the Parties and their Affiliates with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

11.3 **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party will pay its own
costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the Transactions.

 



 

11.4 **_Disclosure_**. Unless the context otherwise requires, all capitalized
terms used in the Schedules shall have the respective meanings assigned to
such terms in this Agreement. Neither the Schedules, the exhibits nor any
disclosure made in or by virtue of them constitutes or implies any
representation, warranty, or covenant by the Contributor, the Alta Mesa
Parties or Buyer not expressly set out in the Agreement, and neither the
Schedules, the exhibits, nor any such disclosure has the effect of, or may be
construed as, adding to, broadening, deleting from or revising the scope of
any of the representations, warranties, or covenants of the Contributor, the
Alta Mesa Parties or Buyer in the Agreement. Any item or matter disclosed or
listed on any particular Schedule is deemed to be disclosed or listed on any
other Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such item relates
or is applicable to, or is properly disclosed under, such other Schedule or
the section of this Agreement to which such other Schedule corresponds,
notwithstanding the fact that the Schedules are arranged to correspond to the
sections of the

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, that a particular section of this Agreement makes reference to a
particular Schedule, or that a particular representation, warranty or covenant
in this Agreement may not make reference to a Schedule. Matters reflected in
the Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement
to be reflected in the Schedules. The fact that any item of information is
contained in the Schedules is not an admission of liability under any
applicable Law, and does not mean that such information is material, but
rather is intended only to qualify the representations, warranties and
covenants in the Agreement and to set forth other information required by the
Agreement. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply that such
amount, or a higher or lower amount, or the item so included, or any other
item, is or is not material, and no Party shall use the specification of any
such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy
between or among the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described herein or included in the Schedules is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. The information set forth on the Schedules or
exhibits shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material",
"materially", "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect", or any similar
qualification in this Agreement. Neither the specification of any item or
matter in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or another item or matter, is or is not in the
ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the specification or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between or
among the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter described or
not described herein or included or not included in the Schedules is or is not
in the ordinary course of business for purposes of the Agreement. Headings
have been inserted in the Schedules for reference only and do not amend the
descriptions of the disclosed items set forth in the Agreement.

 



 

11.5 **_Waiver_**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law, will, subject to _Section
10.2_, be cumulative and not alternative.

 



 

11.6 **_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by the Contributor and Buyer.

 



 

11.7 **_No Third Party Beneficiary_**. Except for the provisions of _Section
6.2(b)_, _Section 6.5_, _Section 6.6(i)_ and _Section 10.3_ (which are
intended to be for the benefit of the Persons identified therein), the terms
and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not
the intention of the Parties to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any
other Person; _provided_ that only Buyer and each Contributor (and their
respective successors and assigns) will have the right to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement on its behalf or on behalf of any of its related
indemnitees (but shall not be obligated to do so).

 



      
 

 



 

11.8 **_Assignment; Binding Effect_**. Any Party may assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate but such assignment shall not release
such Party from its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party, and any attempt to do so will be void, except for assignments
and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to this _Section 11.8_, this
Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

11.9 **_Headings_**. The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and do not modify, define or limit any of
the terms or provisions hereof.

 



 

11.10 **_Invalid Provisions_**. Upon any determination that any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
under any applicable rule of Law or public policy, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

11.11 **_Counterparts; Facsimile_**. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Any facsimile or
.pdf copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed
originals.

 



 

11.12 **_Governing Law; Venue; and Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Texas (without regard to any conflict of laws principles
thereof). Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought
and determined by courts of the State of Texas located in Harris County and
the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Texas, Southern District, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any legal
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further
agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in any court or jurisdiction
other than the above specified courts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of
judgment in any other jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent
permitted by Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against a Party in
any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit
on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such judgment.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATED
THERETO.

 



      
 

 



 

11.13 **_Trust Account Waiver_**. Reference is made to the final prospectus of
Buyer, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-216409) (the " ** _Prospectus_** "),
and dated as of March 23, 2017. Each of the Contributor, the Contributor
Owners and the Alta Mesa Parties acknowledges that it has read the Prospectus
and understands that Buyer has established the Trust Account containing the
proceeds of its initial public offering (the " ** _IPO_** ") and from certain
private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO initially in an
amount of approximately $1,035.0 million for the benefit of Buyers public
stockholders and certain parties (including the underwriters of the IPO) and
that Buyer may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to Buyers
public stockholders in the event they elect to exercise their Buyer
Stockholder Redemption Right, (b) to Buyers public stockholders if Buyer
fails to consummate a Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months from
the closing of the IPO, (c) to pay any income taxes with any interest earned
on the amounts held in the Trust Account or (d) to Buyer after or concurrently
with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of
Buyer entering into this Agreement with the Contributor, the Contributor
Owners and the Alta Mesa Parties regarding the Transactions, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, each of the Contributor, the Contributor Owners and the
Alta Mesa Parties hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that,
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it does not
now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions
therefrom, or make any claim against, the Trust Account, regardless of whether
such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way
to, any proposed or actual business relationship between Buyer, the
Contributor, any of the Contributor Owners or the Alta Mesa Parties, this
Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises
based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability. Each
of the Contributor, the Contributor Owners and the Alta Mesa Parties hereby
irrevocably waives any such claims it may have against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of,
or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Buyer and
will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this
Agreement). Each of the Contributor, the Contributor Owners and the Alta Mesa
Parties agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to
this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Buyer to induce it to enter in
this Agreement, and each of the Contributor, the Contributor Owners and the
Alta Mesa Parties further intends and understands such waiver to be valid,
binding and enforceable under applicable Law. To the extent any Contributor,
any of the Contributor Owners or any Alta Mesa Party commences any action or
proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any
matter relating to Buyer, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
monetary relief against Buyer, the Contributor, such Contributor Owner or such
Alta Mesa Party hereby acknowledges and agrees its sole remedy shall be
against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such claim shall not
permit the Contributor, such Contributor Owner or such Alta Mesa Party (or any
party claiming on such Persons behalf) to have any claim against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained
therein; _provided_ that (i) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit
the Contributor, the Contributor Owners or the Alta Mesa Entities right to
pursue a claim against Buyer for legal relief against assets held outside the
Trust Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief, and (ii)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the
Contributor, the Contributor Owners or the Alta Mesa Entities may have in the
future against Buyers assets or funds that are

 



      
 

 



 

not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released
from the Trust Account and any assets that have been purchased or acquired
with any such funds). In the event any Contributor, any of the Contributor
Owners or any Alta Mesa Party or any of their respective Affiliates commences
any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or
arising out of any matter relating to Buyer, which proceeding seeks, in whole
or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom), whether in the form of money damages or injunctive relief, Buyer
shall be entitled to recover from the Contributor and such Contributor Owner
or such Alta Mesa Party, as applicable, the associated legal fees and costs in
connection with any such action, in the event Buyer prevails in such action or
Proceeding.
