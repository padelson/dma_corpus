Property infringes on the rights of any Person, subject to such claims and
infringements as do not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to any

action, proceeding or investigation that would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, if adversely determined. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries, nor any Company Employee, consultant, officer or director

Directors of the Company that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of and
adopt and approve the Required Proposals and the Other Proposal; and (iv)
except as otherwise permitted by  _Section 6.2_, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger, acquisition or similar agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal.

(c) If all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (viii) below are
met, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company, in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal, from withholding,
withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in favor of the Required
Proposals and the Other Proposal, and, in the case of a Superior
Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its
stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or
exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by the Board of
Directors of the Company or a committee thereof, a  _"Change of
Recommendation"_ ):

(i) a Superior Proposal is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; 

(ii) the Company Stockholders Meeting has not occurred; provided, however,
that if the meeting is adjourned in accordance with _Section 6.2(a),_ then
such meeting shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this clause
(ii);

(iii) the Company shall have provided to the Crusader Representative a copy of
all written materials delivered after the date of this Agreement to the Person
or group making the Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior
Proposal, and shall make available to the Crusader Representative all written
materials and information made available to the Person or group making the
Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal;

(iv) the Company shall provide the Crusader Representative with at least two
business days prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the
members of the Companys Board of Directors) of any meeting of the Companys
Board of Directors at which the Companys Board of Directors is reasonably
expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal to determine whether such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal;

(v) the Company shall have provided written notice to the
Crusader Representative (a _"Notice of Superior Proposal"_ ) advising the
Crusader Entities that the Company has received a Superior Proposal and that
the Board intends to effect a Change  



 

52  of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do so, specifying in
reasonable detail all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and identifying the Person, entity or group making such
Superior Proposal;

(vi) the Crusader Entities shall not have, within five business days after
the Crusader Representatives receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that the receipt of a Modified Superior Proposal
during such five business day period shall require a new Notice of a Superior
Proposal and a new five day period with respect to such Modified Superior
Proposal), made a Matching Bid (as hereinafter defined) that the Companys
Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with and the receipt of advice from its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor) to be at least as favorable to the
Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the
Board of Directors of the Company shall convene a meeting to consider any
such Matching Bid by the Crusader Entities reasonably promptly following the
receipt thereof and that the Board of Directors of the Company will not
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation to the Companys
stockholders in favor of approval and adoption of the Required Proposals or
the Other Proposal for five business days after receipt by the Crusader
Entities of the Notice of Superior Proposal);

(vii) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with and receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel, that,
in light of such Superior Proposal and any Matching Bid, the failure to effect
a Change of Recommendation would be a breach of its fiduciary obligations to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; and 

(viii) The Company shall have complied in all material respects with this
_Section 6.2_ and _Sections 6.1_  and _6.3_.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the Companys obligation
to call, give notice of, hold and convene the Company Stockholders Meeting
(regardless of the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the
Board of Directors of the Company of any Acquisition Proposal) unless there
has been a Change of Recommendation, in which case the Company Stockholders
Meeting shall be cancelled. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders for a vote any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do so
at or prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, _"Superior Proposal"_ shall mean any
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal changed to fifty percent (50%) for purposes
of this definition), on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith, after consultation with and receipt of advice from
its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
offer, the Person or group making the offer and the source of financing, to
be (i) more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of
view than the terms of the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by
either party to amend the terms of this Agreement) and the Person making the
offer,  



 

53  and (ii) reasonably capable of being consummated without undue delay on the
terms as proposed; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be deemed
to be a Superior Proposal if any financing required to consummate the
transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed or if there is a
general due diligence condition to any partys obligations to consummate the
transaction that is the subject of the Superior Proposal.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that the Company shall not effect a Change of
Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.2_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to satisfaction of the conditions in _Section 7.2(f)_,
concurrently with or after a Change of Recommendation, the Board of Directors
of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Agreement, cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ and concurrently with such termination
enter into a definitive agreement providing for the transactions contemplated
by such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_, and any purported
termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ shall be void and of no force or
effect, unless the Company shall have complied in all material respects with
all the provisions of this _Section 6.2_ and _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ ,
including the notification provisions in this _Section 6.2(g)_, and with all
applicable requirements of  _Section 9.2(b)_ (including the payment of the
Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with such termination) in connection
with such Superior Proposal; and provided further, however, that the Company
shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(h)_: (i) until after the fifth business day after the date of delivery of
a Notice of Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to cause the Company to exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ (it being understood and agreed that,
prior to any termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ taking effect, any
amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior Proposal
(such amended Superior Proposal, a _"Modified Superior Proposal"_ ) shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five business day period
with respect to such Modified Superior Proposal) and (ii) unless either (x)
on or before the expiration of the five business day period after the date of
the delivery to the Crusader Representative of any Notice of Superior
Proposal, the Crusader Entities do not make a good faith written proposal (a
_"Matching Bid"_ ) in response to such Superior Proposal or (y) following
receipt of a Matching Bid, the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in
good faith, after consultation with and the receipt of advice from its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors and after taking into
consideration the Matching Bid, that the Superior Proposal to which the Notice
of Superior Proposal relates continues to be a Superior Proposal. 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, _"Acquisition Proposal"_ shall mean any
offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by the Crusader Entities)
relating to, or involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from the Company by
any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the
total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
 



 

54  Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the
total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (B) any
sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange,
transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business),
acquisition, or disposition of more than 15% of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (C) any liquidation, dissolution,
recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of the
Company.

(i) As used in this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" shall be deemed to
mean a "Modified Superior Proposal" if a Modified Superior Proposal has been
made.

(j) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ shall permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, term sheet or agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to
an Acquisition Proposal other than a confidentiality agreement containing
terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement
until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_.

_Section 6.3 No Solicitation_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing or termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , the Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
officers, directors, affiliates, Company Employees or consultants or any
investment banker, attorney, advisor or other agent or representative
retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
seek, entertain, encourage, facilitate, support or induce the making,
submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) continue or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) grant any
waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any class or series of the capital stock of the Company, (iv) engage
or participate in discussions with any Person with respect to any unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal, except as necessary to ascertain the terms of and
understand any Acquisition Proposal and to decline to engage or participate in
such discussions by referring to the existence of these provisions, (v)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, except as specifically
provided in _Section 6.2(b)_, or (vi) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, term sheet or agreement contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that this
_Section 6.3_ shall not prohibit the Company, prior to satisfaction of the
conditions in  _Section 7.3(f)_, from engaging in discussions or
negotiations regarding or furnishing information to the party making an
unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal so long as, and only to
the extent that, (A) the Companys Board of Directors in good faith, after
consultation with and receipt of advice from its outside financial and outside
legal advisors, concludes that such Acquisition Proposal is, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, (B) neither the
Company nor any representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries acting under
its authority shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in  



 

55   _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ or this _Section 6.3_, (C) the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with and
receipt of advice from its outside financial and outside legal counsel, that
such action is required in order for the Board of Directors of the Company to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements, (D) at least two business days prior to
entering into discussions or negotiations (other than preliminary discussions
permitted above) with, or furnishing information to, such party, the
Company gives the Crusader Entities written notice of the identity of such
Person, entity or group and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and of the Companys intention to take action with
respect to such Person, entity or group, and the Company receives from such
Person or group an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less
favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, (E) the Company
gives the Crusader Entities at least two business days advance notice of its
intent to furnish such nonpublic information or enter into such discussions,
and (F) contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to such Person
or group, the Company furnishes such information to the Crusader Entities (to
the extent such information has not been previously furnished by the Company
to the Crusader Entities).

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24
hours after the receipt thereof, advise the Crusader Entities orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal, request for information which the Company
reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with
respect to or which could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, any material modification or material amendment to the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person
or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and copies
of all written materials sent or provided to the Company by or on behalf of
any Person or group or provided to such Person or group by or on behalf of the
Company after the date of this Agreement. The Company shall take reasonable
efforts to keep the Crusader Entities informed in all material respects of
the status and details (including material amendments or proposed amendments)
of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(c) The Company shall immediately cease, and shall cause any Person acting on
its behalf to cease, and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any third party conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall request any such third parties in possession
of confidential information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
was furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any such Subsidiary to return
or destroy all such information in the possession of such third party or the
agent or advisor of such third party.

_Section 6.4 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For six years after the Closing, the Company shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing, an officer or director of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (each an _"Indemnified Party"_ ),
who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, or
investigative (a _"proceeding"_ ), against all losses, damages, liabilities,
fees and expenses  



 

56  (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and experts and
judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement (provided that any such settlement is effected with the prior
written consent of the Company, which will not be unreasonably withheld))
actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party because the
Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company pertaining to any act or omission existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing including any act or omission relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions (the _"Indemnified Liabilities"_ ) to the
full extent permitted under Nevada law or the Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws. If an Indemnified Party makes or asserts any claim
for Indemnified Liabilities, any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards
set forth under the Nevada Revised Business Corporations Act shall be made by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Company and the
Indemnified Party; and provided, further, that nothing herein shall impair
any rights or obligations of any Indemnified Party. If any claim or claims are
brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the
Closing), such Indemnified Party may select counsel for the defense of such
claim, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.

(b) The Company shall promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of each Indemnified Party in connection with any such action or proceeding
described above, as such expenses are incurred, to the fullest extent
permitted by the Nevada Revised Business Corporations Act, subject to the
receipt by the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

(c) The Company shall maintain the Companys existing officers and directors
liability insurance policy ( _"D andO Insurance"_) for a period of at least six
years after the Closing, but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions prior to the Closing; provided, that the Company may substitute
therefor (i) policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts
containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers or
(ii) a run-off directors and officers liability insurance policy for the
Companys current policies to be effective from and after the Closing with
respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the
Closing and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance,
which policy, without any lapse in coverage, will provide coverage for a
period of six years after the Closing (or the Company otherwise will maintain
coverage for such period) and contain terms and conditions which are
substantially comparable to the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy.

_Section 6.5 Further Assurances_. Each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals and to do all other
things necessary for the consummation of the Transactions; provided, however,
that in no event shall any party or its Subsidiaries be required to pay, and
without the Crusader Representatives prior consent the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not pay, any fee, penalties or other consideration to any
third party under any agreement to obtain any consent or approval required for
the consummation of the Transactions. The parties shall take such further
action to deliver or cause to be delivered to each other at the Closing and at
such other times thereafter as shall be reasonably agreed by such parties such
additional agreements or instruments as any of them may reasonably request
for the purpose of carrying out this Agreement and the Transactions. The
parties shall afford each other  



 

57  access to all information, documents, records and personnel who may be
necessary for any party to comply with laws or regulations (including the
filing and payment of taxes and handling tax audits), to fulfill its
obligations with respect to indemnification hereunder or to defend itself
against suits or claims of others. The Company and the Crusader Operating
Entities shall duly preserve all files, records or any similar items of the
Company or the Crusader Operating Entities received or obtained as a result of
the Transactions with the same care and for the same period of time as it
would preserve its own similar assets.

_Section 6.6 Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided in _Section 9.2(c)_ and _Section 6.16_, the Crusader
Operating Entities shall bear and timely pay all Expenses incurred by the
Crusader Entities (pro rata in relation to the number of Common Shares to be
delivered pursuant to _Sections 1.1(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_ to the
Crusader Parent Entity owning the membership interest of such Crusader
Operating Entity) and the Company shall bear and timely pay all Expenses
incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that if this
Agreement is terminated for any reason, then, except as provided in _Section
9.2(c)_ and _Section 6.16_, the allocable share of the Company and the
Crusader Operating Entities for all Expenses (including any fees and expenses
of accountants, experts, and consultants, but excluding the fees and expenses
of outside legal counsel and investment bankers) related to preparing,
printing, filing and mailing the Proxy and all SEC and other regulatory
filing fees incurred in connection with the Proxy and, if required, the HSR
Act shall be allocated one-half each (and, as among such one-half allocated to
the Crusader Operating Entities, pro rata as provided above); provided,
further, however, that (i) if the Crusader Entities terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the Companys breach pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, then the
Crusader Entities shall not be required to pay any of the Companys Expenses
or (ii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to a breach by a
Crusader Entity pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_, then the Company shall not be
required to pay any of the Crusader Entities Expenses.

(b) _"Expenses"_ as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of outside
legal counsel, accountants, auditors, financing sources, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a
party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the due diligence,
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the preparation, printing, filing and
mailing of the Proxy, the solicitation of stockholder approval, HSR Act

the date hereof until the Closing, each party shall confer on a regular and
frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other parties to
report operational matters of materiality and the general status of ongoing
operations and shall promptly provide the other party or its counsel with
copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

_Section 6.8 Publicity_. Neither the Company, the Crusader Entities, nor any
of their respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other  



 

58  announcement or public statement (including any statements to stockholders
of the Company) with respect to the Transactions without the prior
consultation of the other parties, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such announcement or public statement (including any statements to
stockholders of the Company) without the consent of the other parties, except
as may be reasonably determined to be required by applicable law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, and each party shall
use reasonable efforts to provide copies of such release or other announcement
to the other party hereto, and give due consideration to such comments as
each such other party may have, prior to such release or other announcement.
Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company, the Crusader Entities,
nor any of their respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication
of any presentation to be provided orally or in writing to third parties,
including any presentation to be made to stockholders of the Company or the
owners of the Crusader Entities, regarding the Transactions, without
consulting with the other party regarding the Persons to whom such
presentations shall be provided, the timing of delivery of such presentations
and the representatives of the Company and the Crusader Entities who shall be
present at each delivery of such presentation (it being agreed that each of
the Company and the Crusader Entities shall be entitled to have at least one
representative present at each delivery of such presentation), and shall not
make any such presentation without the consent of the other parties, except
as may be reasonably determined to be required by applicable law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange.

_Section 6.9 Additional Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations, or to
remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, subject, however, to the Company Stockholders
Approval.

_Section 6.10 Filings_. Each party shall make all filings such party is
required to make with any Governmental Authority in connection herewith or
desirable to achieve the purposes contemplated hereby, and shall cooperate as
needed with respect to any such filing by any other party.

_Section 6.11 Consents_. Each of the Company and the Crusader Entities shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents necessary or
advisable in connection with its obligations hereunder; provided, however,
that in no event shall any party or its Subsidiaries be required to pay, and
without the Crusader Representatives prior consent the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not pay, any fee, penalties or other consideration to
any third party under any agreement to obtain any consent or approval required
for the consummation of the Transactions.

_Section 6.12 Company Board of Directors_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, certain of the existing directors of the
Company shall have executed and delivered to the Company an irrevocable
resignation, in the form of _Exhibit E_ hereto (a  _"Resignation"_ ), of
their position as a director effective as of the Closing and the parties
hereto contemplate that additional Resignations will be delivered as
contemplated by _Section 6.26_. From time to time following the date hereof,
the Crusader Representative may deliver to the Company (i) a writing
identifying one or more persons to be  



 

59  included in the Proxy (the " _Director Nominees_ ") for election, effective
as of the Closing, as members of the Companys Board of Directors, (ii)
biographical descriptions of each Director Nominee, with each such description
containing all of the information required to be disclosed about nominees for
directors in a proxy statement filed with the SEC, (iii) a completed
directors questionnaire executed by the Director Nominee in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, and (iv) a written statement executed by the
Director Nominee consenting to serve as a director of the Company if so
elected. Each such Director Nominee shall be acceptable to the Companys
Board of Directors, acting reasonably. If the Company does not notify the
Crusader Representative whether the Director Nominee is acceptable to the
Companys Board within five business days following receipt of such notice,
the Company shall be deemed to have delivered notice that such Director
Nominee is not acceptable to the Companys Board of Directors.

(b) If, at any time prior to Closing, any Director Nominee who was deemed
acceptable by the Companys Board of Directors is unable, for any reason, to
serve as a director, the Crusader Representative may propose to the Companys
Board of Directors a replacement director by providing the information
regarding such proposed replacement specified in paragraph (a) of this
Section. Each such replacement Director Nominee shall be acceptable to the
Companys Board of Directors, acting reasonably. If the Company does not
notify the Crusader Representative whether the proposed replacement Director
Nominee is acceptable to the Companys Board within five business days
following receipt of such notice, the Company shall be deemed to have
delivered notice that such proposed replacement Director Nominee is not
acceptable to the Companys Board of Directors. 

(c) The composition of the committees of the Companys Board of Directors
immediately following the Closing (including the respective chairmen thereof)
shall be as designated at or immediately following the Closing in the sole
discretion of the Companys Board of Directors but shall meet the independence
and other standards of the AMEX and the SEC.

_Section 6.13 Preparation of the Proxy_. The Company shall prepare and, as
soon as possible following delivery of the 2006 Audit Opinions, file with the
SEC a preliminary version of the Proxy and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC in connection therewith and to
furnish all information required to prepare the definitive Proxy. The Company
shall take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent
to service of process in any jurisdiction) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Common
Shares in the Transactions and the Crusader Operating Entities shall furnish
all information concerning the Crusader Operating Entities and the holders of
Membership Interests and Stock Interests as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action and which meets the requirements of any
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The Company shall as
promptly as practicable notify the Crusader Representative of the receipt of
any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy. The Company
shall cooperate and provide the Crusader Representative with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the draft of the Proxy (including each
amendment or supplement thereto), and all responses to requests for additional
information by and replies to comments of the SEC, prior to filing such with
or sending such to the SEC, and the Crusader Representative and the
Company will provide each other with copies of all such filings made and  



 

60  correspondence with the SEC. Promptly after the staff of the SEC advises the
Company that the staff of the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy,
the Company shall cause the Proxy to be mailed to its stockholders, and if
necessary, after the definitive Proxy has been mailed, promptly circulate
amended, supplemented or supplemental proxy materials and, if required in
connection therewith, re-solicit proxies or written consents, as applicable.
If at any time prior to the Closing, the officers, directors or managers of
the Company or the Crusader Operating Entities discover any statement which,
in light of the circumstances to which it is made, is false or misleading
with respect to a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to
make the statement made in the proxy/prospectus not misleading, then such
party shall immediately notify the other party of such misstatements or
omissions.

_Section 6.14 Stock Exchange Listing_. The Company shall use its best efforts
to cause the Common Shares to be issued in the Transactions and the Common
Shares subject to issuance under the 2008 LTIP to be approved and admitted for
listing on the American Stock Exchange at least ten consecutive trading days
prior to the Closing, subject to official notice of issuance.

_Section 6.15 Notice of Certain Events_. Each party to this Agreement shall
promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other parties of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person (or other Person) is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions;

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending on the
date hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
_Section 3.9_,  _Section 3.11_, _Section 4.10_ or _Section 4.12_, or
which relate to the consummation of the Transactions;

(d) any notice of, or other communication relating to, a default or event
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, received
by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date hereof, under any
material agreement; and

(e) any Crusader Entity Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse
Effect or the occurrence of any event which would result in a Crusader Entity
Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be.

_Section 6.16 Site Inspections_. Subject to compliance with applicable law,
from the date hereof until the Closing, each party may undertake (at that
partys sole cost and expense) a reasonable environmental and operational
assessment or assessments (an _"Assessment"_ ) of the other partys
operations, business and/or properties that are the subject of this Agreement.
An Assessment may include a review of Permits, files and records including,
but not limited to, environmental investigations, audits, assessments,
studies, testing and management plans and systems, as well as visual and
physical inspections and testing. An Assessment will not include any soil
borings, groundwater or any other "Phase II _"_ testing without the consent
of the party  



 

61  whose operations, business or property is the subject of such Assessment
(the _"Inspected Party"_ ) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Before conducting an Assessment, the party intending
to conduct such Assessment (the _"Inspecting Party"_ ) shall confer with the
Inspected Party regarding the nature, scope and scheduling of such

and exclusive remedy for any failure of the Crusader Representative to
deliver Director Nominees acceptable to the Companys Board of Directors
pursuant to _Section 6.12_ or to otherwise satisfy clauses, (A) - (C) of

Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ or by the Crusader Entities pursuant to
_Section 9.1(f)_ and (C) within twelve months of the date of such

_Section 9.1(g)_; or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section

wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in

Termination Fee (or any portion thereof, as applicable) shall constitute
conclusive evidence that this Agreement has been validly terminated.

9.1(g)_ or _9.1(h)_ , then, notwithstanding _Section 6.6(a)_, the Company

the Crusader Entities for their Expenses up to a maximum amount of $500,000.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Sections 9.1(i)_ , _(j)_ or
_(k)_ then, notwithstanding _Section 6.6(a)_, the Crusader Entities shall
pay upon demand by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company, such amount as may be required to
reimburse the Company for its Expenses up to a maximum amount of $500,000.

(d) The Company acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the amount of, and the basis for payment of, the Termination Fee are
reasonable and appropriate in all respects, and that, without these
agreements, the Crusader Entities would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly any fee or Expenses payable
by it pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, then the Company shall pay to the
Crusader Entities their costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with collecting such fees and expenses, together with interest on
the amount of the fee at the rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points from the date
such payment was due under this Agreement until the date of payment. The fees
and Expenses payable by the Company pursuant to this  _Section 9.2_ shall be
paid by the Company without reservation of rights or protests, and the Company
upon making any such payment shall be deemed to have released and waived any
and all claims that it may have to recover such amounts. 

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement, each of the Voting Agreement, the Non-
Transfer Agreements, the Release and the Resignations will terminate
according to its terms.

receive notices and communications on their behalf with respect to any
matters related to this Agreement; (ii) to litigate, mediate, arbitrate,
defend or settle, or take any other actions and execute and any other
documents that the Crusader Representative deems advisable in connection with
enforcing any rights or obligations or defending, any claim or action under
this Agreement on behalf of the Crusader Entities; (iii) to sign receipts,
consents or other documents in connection with the Crusader Representatives
duties hereunder; (iv) to terminate this Agreement on behalf of each of the
Crusader Entities pursuant to _Section 9.1_ and (v) to take  



 

72  any and all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Crusader
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case,
without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Crusader Entity. Notice
or communications to or from the Crusader Representative shall constitute
notice to or from the Crusader Entities. All actions to be taken by a Crusader
Entity shall be taken solely by the Crusader Representative.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Crusader
Representative shall not incur any liability with respect to any action taken
or suffered by it in reliance upon any direction, instruction, consent,
statement or other document believed by it to be genuinely and duly
authorized, nor for any action or inaction in reliance in good faith upon
advice of legal counsel. If the Crusader Representative shall dissolve, resign
or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the Crusader
Parent Entities, acting by consent of Crusader Parent Entities having
an interest in the Share Consideration equal to a majority of the Common
Shares constituting the Share Consideration (a _"Majority"_ ) shall, as soon
as practicable after such dissolution or resignation, appoint a successor to
the Crusader Representative and immediately thereafter notify the Company of
the identity of such successor. If a Majority chooses to remove the Crusader
Representative for any reason, such Majority shall simultaneously appoint a
successor to the Crusader Representative and immediately thereafter notify
the Company of the identity of such successor. Any such successor pursuant to
either of the preceding two sentences shall succeed the Crusader
Representative as Crusader Representative hereunder.

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Crusader Representative
shall constitute a decision of the Crusader Entities and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Crusader Entities. The Company may rely upon
any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Crusader Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Crusader
Entities. Although the Crusader Representative shall not be obligated to
obtain instructions from the Crusader Entities, prior to any decision, act,
consent or instruction, if, and to the extent that, the Crusader
Representative receives any written instructions from a Majority, the
Crusader Representative shall comply with such instructions.

(d) The Crusader Representative shall not be liable to the Crusader Entities
for any act taken or omitted to be taken as Crusader Representative, except
for the commission of actual fraud or willful misconduct. Each Crusader Entity
shall severally indemnify the Crusader Representative and hold the Crusader
Representative harmless against any damages or expenses incurred without bad
faith on the part of the Crusader Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Crusader Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Crusader Representative.

(e) The power of attorney granted by the Crusader Entities pursuant to this
section is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and shall not terminate
or otherwise be affected by the death, disability, incompetence, bankruptcy
or insolvency of any Crusader Entity.

(f) Each of Knight I, Knight II, RCH and Hawk hereby agrees to pay to the
Crusader Representative its pro rata portion (in accordance with the ratio of
(i) the number of Common Shares to be received by their respective Crusader
Parent Entity pursuant to this  



 

73  Agreement as part of the Share Consideration to (ii) the aggregate number of
Common Shares to be received by all such Crusader Parent Entities pursuant to
this Agreement as part of the Share Consideration) of the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Crusader Representative in connection with its acting
as the Crusader Representative in accordance with this Agreement.

_Section 10.3 Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such invalidity
or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof which
shall remain in full force and effect.

_Section 10.4 Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors, and assigns; provided, however, that neither
this Agreement nor any rights hereunder shall be assignable or otherwise
subject to hypothecation and any assignment in violation hereof shall be null

_Section 10.6 Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same Agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties and delivered to each party.

_Section 10.7 Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, all documents contemplated
herein or required hereby, the Confidentiality Agreements and the Voting
Agreement represent the entire Agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and shall supersede any and all previous contracts,
arrangements or understandings between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

_Section 10.8 Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted,
and governed in accordance with the laws of the state of Texas, without
reference to rules relating to conflicts of law, except that the corporate
laws of the State of Nevada shall govern the internal operations of the
Company.

_Section 10.9 Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Agreement
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of the State of Texas in
any dispute or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and agrees
that all claims in respect of such dispute or action may be heard and
determined in any such court except for the enforcement of judgments referred
to in the next sentence. Each party also agrees not to bring any dispute
or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each party agrees that a final judgment in any dispute or action so brought
will be conclusive and may be enforced by dispute or action on the judgment or
in any other manner provided at law (common, statutory or other) or in equity
in any court having jurisdiction over the party. Each party waives any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any dispute or action so brought
and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be required of any
other party with respect thereto.



 

74 _Section 10.10 Attorneys Fees_. If any action at law or equity, including
an action for declaratory relief, is brought to enforce or interpret any
provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses from the other party, which fees and
expenses shall be in addition to any other relief which may be awarded.

_Section 10.11 No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in 
_Section 6.4_, no Person other than the parties to this Agreement is an
intended beneficiary of this Agreement or any portion hereof.

_Section 10.12 Disclosure Schedules_. The disclosures made on any disclosure
schedule, including the Crusader Disclosure Schedule and the Company
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to any representation or warranty shall
be deemed to be made with respect to any other representation or warranty
requiring the same or similar disclosure to the extent that the relevance of
such disclosure to other representations and warranties is reasonably evident
from the face of the disclosure schedule. The inclusion of any matter on any
disclosure schedule will not be deemed an admission by any party that such
listed matter is material or that such listed matter has or would have a
Crusader Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

_Section 10.13 Amendments and Supplements_. At any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Transactions by the
stockholders of the Company and prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be
amended or supplemented in writing by the Company and the Crusader Entities
with respect to any of the terms contained in this Agreement, except as
otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that following approval of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company there shall be no amendment or
change to the provisions hereof unless permitted by the NRS without further
approval by the stockholders of the Company.

party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

(c) subject to the proviso of _Section 10.13_, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or the
Crusader Entities in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.



 

75 _Section 10.15 Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred
to as a "Company Affiliate" or "Crusader Affiliate", as applicable: (i) any
direct or indirect holder of equity interests or securities in the Company or
a Crusader Entity, as applicable (whether limited or general
partners, members, stockholders or otherwise), and (ii) any director,
officer, manager, Company Employee, consultant, representative or agent of (A)
the Company or a Crusader Entity, as applicable, or (B) any Person who
controls the Company or a Crusader Entity, as applicable. Except to the
extent that a Company Affiliate is an express party thereto, no Company
Affiliate shall have any liability or obligation to any Crusader Entity of any
nature whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement and the
Transactions as a result of such Persons status as a Company Affiliate, and
the Crusader Entities hereby waive and release all claims of any such
liability and obligation. Except to the extent that a Crusader Affiliate is
an express party thereto, no Crusader Affiliate shall have any liability or
obligation to the Company of any nature whatsoever in connection with or under
this Agreement or the Transactions as a result of such Persons status as a
Crusader Affiliate, and the Company hereby waives and releases all claims of
any such liability and obligation.

_Section 10.16 Specific Performance_. The parties recognize and agree that
if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and
irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, prior to any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, but subject to the
last sentence of this  _Section 10.16_, the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof. In the event that any action shall
be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party
shall allege, and each hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate
remedy at law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement by a Crusader
Entity or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
if the Company is in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement so as to cause any
of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_ not to be
satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Crusader Entity shall be entitled
to an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement if any
Crusader Entity is, or collectively are, in material breach of its or their
respective representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or
_Section 7.2_ not to be satisfied.

_Section 10.17 Limitation on Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY
OTHER PARTY, OR TO ANY INDEMNITEE, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, AND
NO CLAIM SHALL BE MADE OR AWARDED AGAINST ANY PARTY, FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES.

_Section 10.18 Authorship; Representation by Counsel_. The parties agree that
the terms and language of this Agreement were the result of negotiations
between the parties and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has  



 

76  been represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement.

_Section 10.19 Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

end on the next day which is a business day.
