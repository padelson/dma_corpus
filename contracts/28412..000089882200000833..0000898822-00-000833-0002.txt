                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 31, 2000 (this
"Agreement"), by and among IMPERIAL BANCORP, a California corporation (the
"Company"), COMERICA INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and
COMERICA HOLDINGS INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
                              - - - - - - - - - -


      WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business
combination transaction provided for herein in which the Company will, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into the Merger Sub
(the "Merger"), so that Merger Sub is the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation") in the
Merger; and

      WHEREAS, as a condition to, and immediately after, the execution of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company are entering into a stock option agreement
with the Company as issuer, and Parent as grantee, of the stock option
contemplated thereby (the "Option Agreement") in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A; and

      WHEREAS, as a condition to, and simultaneously with, the execution of this
Agreement, the persons set forth on Exhibit B-1 are entering into support
agreements in the form set forth on Exhibit B-2; and

      WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that the Merger be accounted
for as a "pooling of interests" under generally accepted accounting principles
and constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code; and

      WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

       1.1 THE MERGER. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") and the General Corporation Law of the State of California
(the "CGCL"), at the Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into
Merger Sub. Merger Sub shall be the Surviving Corporation in the


<PAGE>


Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of the Company shall terminate.

       (b) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the
combination of the Company and Parent (including without limitation the
provisions of this Article I) if and to the extent it deems such change to be
desirable; provided, however, that no such change shall (A) alter or change the
           --------  -------
amount of consideration to be provided to holders of Company Common Shares
provided for in this Agreement (the "Merger Consideration"), (B) adversely
affect the tax treatment of shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger
Consideration or (C) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

       1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the "Delaware Certificate") that shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary"), and in
the agreement of merger (the "California Agreement") that shall be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of California (the "California Secretary"),
in each case as of the Closing Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date
and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Delaware
Certificate and the California Agreement.

       1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER.  At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL and CGCL.

       1.4 CONVERSION OF STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holder of any of the following securities:

       (a) Subject to Section 2.2, each Common Share of the Company ("Company
Common Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except for (i) Company Common Shares owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned
Subsidiaries (other than (A) Company Common Shares held, directly or indirectly,
in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such
Company Common Shares, whether held directly or indirectly by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, being referred to
as "Trust Account Shares") and (B) Company Common Shares held by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a
debt previously contracted (any such Company Common Shares that are similarly
held, whether held directly or indirectly by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, being herein referred to as "DPC
Shares")) and (ii) Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into 0.46 of a share
(the "Exchange Ratio") of Common Stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Parent
("Parent Common Stock").

       (b) All Company Common Shares that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned
Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


       (c) Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall remain issued and outstanding and unaffected by the
Merger.

If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Shares or
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities
as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio.

       1.5 COMPANY OPTIONS. (a) At the Effective Time, without any action on the
part of any holder of any such option, each option to purchase Company Common
Shares (each, a "Company Option") that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto shall vest and shall cease to represent a right to
acquire Company Common Shares and shall be converted automatically into an
option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise
price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the
Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder):

              (i) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject to
       the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of Company
       Common Shares purchasable upon exercise of the original Company Option
       and the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded, if necessary, up or
       down, to the nearest whole share; and

              (ii) The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under the
       new option shall be equal to the exercise price per Company Common Shares
       under the original Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, PROVIDED
       that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent.

       (b) The adjustment provided in Section 1.5(a) with respect to any options
that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be
effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The
duration and other terms of the new option shall be the same as the original
option.

       1.6 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION.  At the Effective Time, the Merger Sub
Certificate shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

       1.7 BYLAWS.  At the Effective Time, the Merger Sub Bylaws shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

       1.8 TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes
of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and that the Merger shall be accounted for
as a "pooling of interests" under generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP").

       1.9 BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION.  At the Effective Time,
the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be comprised of the directors
of Merger Sub.


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


       1.10 DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. . If any record holder of Company Common Shares
which are "dissenting shares" (as defined in Section 1300(b) of the CGCL) (any
such Company Common Shares, "Dissenting Shares," and any such record holder, a
"Dissenting Shareholder") shall be entitled to require the Company or the
Surviving Corporation to purchase such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Chapter 13
of the CGCL, the Company shall give Parent notice thereof and Parent shall have
the right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto.
Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any demand pursuant to Section 1301 of the CGCL. If
any Dissenting Shareholders shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to require the Company or the Surviving Corporation
to purchase his or her Dissenting Shares, the Dissenting Shares held by such
Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting
Shares had been converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.4(a).

                                   ARTICLE II

                               EXCHANGE OF SHARES

       2.1 EXCHANGE OF COMPANY SHARE CERTIFICATES FOR PARENT STOCK CERTIFICATES.
From the Effective Time until the end of the six-month period following the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to an exchange agent (which may be a
subsidiary bank of Parent) appointed prior to the Effective Time by Parent (and
not reasonably objected to by the Company) on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Exchange Agent") certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock ("Parent Stock Certificates") and cash in amounts sufficient to
allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of Parent Stock Certificates and
payments that may be required in exchange for certificates representing Company
Common Shares ("Company Share Certificates") pursuant to this Article II. At the
end of such six-month period, any such Parent Stock Certificates and cash
remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with any dividends
or earnings in respect thereof) shall be returned to Parent. Any former holders
of Company Share Certificates who have not theretofore exchanged their Company
Share Certificates for Parent Stock Certificates and cash pursuant to this
Article II shall thereafter be entitled to look exclusively to Parent, and only
as general creditors thereof, for the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash
to which they become entitled upon exchange of their Company Share Certificates
pursuant to this Article II.

       2.2 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Shares, a form
(mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent) of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the Exchange
Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company
Share Certificates in exchange for Parent Stock Certificates and any payments
pursuant to this Article II. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company
Share Certificate for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Company Share Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a Parent Stock Certificate representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock,


                                      -4-


<PAGE>


and a check in the amount, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Article II, and the Company Share Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any amount
payable upon surrender of Company Share Certificates.

       (a) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Share
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Share
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Company
Share Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without
any interest thereon, that theretofore had become payable with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock represented by such Company Share Certificate.

       (b) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of Company Common Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

       (c) If any Parent Stock Certificate or cash payment is to be issued or
made in a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Company Share Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of such Parent Stock Certificate or the making of such cash payment in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Share Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent that any such
taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

       (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Parent.

       (e) In the event any Company Share Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Share
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Share Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

       (f) Upon giving effect to the conversion and exchange described in
Section 1.4, the resulting number of shares of Parent Common Stock of each
registered holder of Company Common Shares shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole number and each such registered holder shall be entitled to receive from
Parent in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock prior to such
rounding down an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (a) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder


                                      -5-

would otherwise be entitled and (b) the average of the closing price per
share of Parent Common Stock for the ten trading days most recently preceding
the Closing Date as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions reporting
system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that would be issued into the ESOP prior to the Effective Time shall be issued
within such plan as a fractional share of Parent Common Stock at the Effective
Time.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

       Except as disclosed in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
Company disclosure schedule delivered to Parent concurrently herewith (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent as follows:

       3.1 CORPORATE ORGANIZATION. (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
California. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case
may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except
to the extent such effect is attributable to the execution of this Agreement and
the announcement thereof, or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word
"Subsidiary" means, with respect to the Company or Parent or any entity, an
entity that is consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes.
The Company is duly registered as a bank holding company and has become a
financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the "BHC Act"), and meets the requirements of Section 4(l) of the BHC Act. True
and complete copies of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as
heretofore amended (the "Company Articles"), and the Bylaws of the Company as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Company Bylaws"), have previously
been made available to Parent.

       (b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether
federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or
the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

       3.2 CAPITALIZATION. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (i) 50,000,000 Company Common Shares, of which, as of
October 16, 2000, 43,462,036 shares were issued and outstanding, and (ii)
5,000,000 Preferred Shares (the "Company Preferred


                                      -6-

Shares" and, together with the Company Common Shares, the "Company Capital
Shares"), no shares of which are issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding Company Common Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this
Agreement, except (i) pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement and (ii)
options and stock issued pursuant to the Company's 1986 Stock Option Plan (the
"Company Stock Plan") or purchased pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock
Ownership Plan, the Company does not have and is not bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of Company Capital
Shares or any other equity securities of the Company or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Company
Capital Shares (collectively, including the items contemplated by clauses (i)
and (ii) of this sentence, the "Company Rights"). As of October 16, 2000, no
shares of Company Capital Shares were reserved for issuance except for 4,390,356
shares of Company Common Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company
Stock Plan. Since October 16, 2000, the Company has not issued any shares of its
capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares
of its capital stock, other than as expressly permitted by Section 5.2 hereof or
pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options granted prior to such date or
pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and the Option Agreement. Set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule is a list containing the name of each holder of an
option to purchase Company Common Shares, the date of each option to purchase
Company Common Shares held by such person, the number of shares subject to each
such option, the expiration date of each such option and the price at which each
such option may be exercised under the applicable stock plan.

       (b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of each of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens (as defined below), and all of such
shares or other ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of the Company has
or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance
of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary
or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. The
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the material investments of the
Company in corporations, joint ventures, partnerships, limited liability
companies and other entities other than its Subsidiaries (each of such entities,
a "Non-Subsidiary Affiliate").

respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in the case of

on the Company.

this Agreement and the Option Agreement and (B) the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except to the extent that
the absence of any such consent, authorization, approval, filing or exemption
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

       3.5 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. (a) Except for normal examinations conducted
by a Regulatory Agency (as defined below) in the ordinary course of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated any
proceeding or, to the best knowledge of the Company, investigation into the
business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since January
1, 1998, except where such proceedings or investigation is not reasonably
likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. There is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception

validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the

Company.

       (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory

returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof (all such
returns being accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly paid
or made provisions for the payment of all Taxes and other governmental charges

Service (the "IRS") or the relevant state taxing authorities, as the case may
be, for all complete tax years, and any liability with respect thereto has been

re-

the Company and its Subsidiaries from their employees for all prior periods in

complete in all material respects have been filed by the Company and its

returns to be due and payable have been paid in full or provision therefor has
been included by the Company in its consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, except where failure to do so will not, either

and (D) there are no Tax liens upon any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries except liens for current Taxes not yet due or liens that will not,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the

include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason
of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed in writing any such
adjustment or change in accounting method, in either case that has had or will

Company. Except as set forth in the financial statements described in Section

understanding, except for such disallowed deductions that will not, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

forth a true and complete list of each employee, consultant or director benefit
plan, arrangement or agreement, whether or not written, including without

Company Benefit Plan, (iii) with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of accrued benefits under such
Company Benefit Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such Company Benefit
Plan's actuary with respect to such Company Benefit Plan, did not, as of its
latest valuation date, exceed the then-current value of the assets of such
Company Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (iv) no Company Benefit

(whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees or

its Subsidiaries or any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
Company Benefit Plan will be subject to either a material civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to
Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, and (ix) to the best knowledge of the Company
there are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine
claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Company Benefit
Plans or any trusts related thereto that could reasonably be expected to have,

(      d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
shareholder approval or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, "excess
parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness
of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of
the Company or any of its affiliates from the Company or any of its affiliates
under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase or affect the
calculation of the amount of any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of any such benefits, (iv) require the funding of any trust or other funding

(i) each loan under which the ESOP is a borrower (each, a "Loan"), (ii) the
lender and guarantor (if any) of each Loan, and (iii) the securities of the
Company that were acquired with such Loan (the "Employer Securities"). Each loan
meets the requirements of Section 4987(d)(3) of the Code. The Employer
Securities are in each case pledged as collateral for the Loan with which they
were acquired, except to the extent they have been released from such pledge and
allocated to the accounts of participants in the ESOP in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 54.4985-7 and 54.4975-11.

       3.12 SEC REPORTS. An accurate and complete copy of each (a) final

Act (the "Company Reports") and prior to the date hereof and (b) communication
mailed by the Company to its shareholders since January 1, 1997 and prior to the
date hereof, has previously been made available to Parent, and no such Company
Report or communication, as of the date thereof, contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
as of a later date (but before the date hereof) shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 1997, as of their respective
dates, all Company Reports filed under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto.

       3.13 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary
for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to
each, and have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any
respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy
and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise,
permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default will not, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

       3.14 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is aparty to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of
any directors, officers or employees, other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (ii) that is a "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be
performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been filed or
incorporated by reference in the Company Reports, (iii) that restricts the
conduct of any line of business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
upon consummation of the Merger will restrict the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to engage in any line of business in which a financial
holding company or bank holding company may lawfully engage or (iv) with or to a
labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement). Each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this
Section 3.14(a) and in Section 3.11(a), whether or not set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "Company Contract," and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any
violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto that will have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

       (b) (i) Each Company Contract is valid and binding on the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by it to date under each Company Contract,
except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, will
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and (iii) no event or
condition exists that constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both,
will constitute, a material default on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such Company Contract, except where such default, either

Company.

       3.15 UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except for those liabilities that are fully
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company
included in the Company December 31, 1999 Form 10-K and for liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, since December
31, 1999, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in the
aggregate, has had or could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

       3.16 INSURANCE. The Company and its Subsidiaries have in effect insurance
coverage with reputable insurers that in respect of amounts, premiums, types and
risks insured, constitutes reasonably adequate coverage against all risks
customarily insured against by bank holding companies and their subsidiaries
comparable in size and operations to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have given timely notice to their insurers with
respect to any covered claim exceeding any applicable deductible or retention
with respect to such claim by in excess of $250,000, and the excess over
applicable deductibles and retentions for all covered claims for which the
Company and its Subsidiaries have not given timely notice to their insurers does
not, in the aggregate, exceed $500,000.

September 30, 2000, neither the Company nor any its Subsidiaries is a party to
any (i) loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement, other than loans the

which the obligor is more than 90 days delinquent in payment of principal or
interest or, to the knowledge of the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit
Officer of the Company, in default of any other material provisions as of the

especially mentioned," or any comparable classification by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; (iii) loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement, including
any loan guarantee, with any director, executive officer or ten percent
shareholder of the Company, or to the knowledge of the Company, any person

arrangement in violation of any law, regulation or rule of any Governmental
Entity where such violation could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

       3.18 TITLE TO PROPERTY.

       (a) REAL PROPERTY. Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and marketable title to all real
property owned by them free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges
or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever, except liens for current taxes not yet
due and payable and other standard exceptions commonly found in title policies
in the jurisdiction where such real property is located, and such encumbrances
and imperfections of title, if any, as do not materially detract from the value
of the properties and do not materially interfere with the present or proposed
use of such properties or otherwise materially impair such operations. Except as
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, all real property
and fixtures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in good condition and
repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

       (b) PERSONAL PROPERTY. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid
and marketable title to all tangible personal property owned by them on the date
hereof, free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances of any
nature whatsoever except as publicly disclosed in the Company Reports filed
prior to the date hereof or as have not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. With respect to personal property used in the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries which is leased rather than owned, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary thereof is in default under the terms of any such
lease the loss of which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

       (c) LEASED PROPERTY. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, all leases of real property and all other leases that are
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries and under which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as lessee, leases real or personal property, are valid and
binding on the Company or its applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, in
accordance with their respective terms, there is not under such lease any
material existing default


                                      -16


<PAGE>


by the Company or such Subsidiary or any event which with notice or lapse of
time would constitute such a default.

       3.19 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, remediation activities
or, to the knowledge of the Company, any private environmental investigations or
governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could
reasonably result in the imposition, on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of any liability or obligation arising under common law relating to any exposure
to any hazardous material or under any local, state or federal environmental
statute, regulation or ordinance enacted for the protection of the environment
including, without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("Environmental Laws"),
pending or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which
liability or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the Company, there
is no reasonable basis for any proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation under any
Environmental Law that will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is not subject to any order,
judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Authority
imposing any liability or obligation with respect to any Environmental Law that
will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Notwithstanding any other representation and warranty in this
Article III, the representations and warranties contained in this Section 3.19
constitute the sole representations and warranties of the Company with respect
to any Environmental law or any hazardous material.

       3.20 INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. All derivative
instruments, as such term is used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133 (including without limitation interest rate swaps, caps, floors and
option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements), whether
entered into for the account of the Company or for the account of a customer of
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and in accordance with prudent banking
practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory
Authority and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the
time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies), and are in full force and effect. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their material
obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have
accrued; and to the Company's knowledge, there are no material breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder.

       3.21 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, to the knowledge of the Company:
(a) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use (in
each case, free and clear of any liens), all Intellectual Property (as defined
below) used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted; (b) the use of any Intellectual Property by the Company and its
Subsidiaries does not infringe on or otherwise violate the rights of any person
and is in accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which the Company
or any Subsidiary acquired the right to use


                                      -17-


<PAGE>


any Intellectual Property; (c) no Person is challenging, infringing on or
otherwise violating any right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to the Company or
its Subsidiaries; and (d) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of any pending claim with respect to any
Intellectual Property used by the Company and its Subsidiaries and no
Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
is being used or enforced in a manner that would result in the abandonment,
cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean trademarks, service marks,
brand names, certification marks, trade dress and other indications of origin,
the goodwill associated with the foregoing and registrations in any jurisdiction
of, and applications in any jurisdiction to register, the foregoing, including
any extension, modification or renewal of any such registration or application;
inventions, discoveries and ideas, whether patentable or not, in any
jurisdiction; patents, applications for patents (including, without limitation,
divisions, continuations, continuations in part and renewal applications), and
any renewals, extensions or reissues thereof, in any jurisdiction; nonpublic
information, trade secrets and confidential information and rights in any
jurisdiction to limit the use or disclosure thereof by any person; writings and
other works, whether copyrightable or not, in any jurisdiction; and
registrations or applications for registration of copyrights in any
jurisdiction, and any renewals or extensions thereof; any similar intellectual
property or proprietary rights.

       3.22 REORGANIZATION; POOLING OF INTERESTS. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Company has no reason to believe that the Merger will not qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and as a
"pooling of interests" for accounting purposes.

       3.23 REGULATORY APPROVALS.  The Company has no reason to believe that any
required regulatory approvals in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby will not be obtained on a timely basis.

       3.24 OPINION. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has
received an opinion from the Financial Advisor to the effect that as of the date
thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
Exchange Ratio is fair to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point
of view. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this
Agreement.

       3.25 COMPANY INFORMATION. The information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries which is provided by the Company or its representatives for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in any other document filed
with any Regulatory Agency in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement (except for such portions thereof that
relate only to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) will comply with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or

Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and (B) the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the
extent that the absence of any such consent, authorization, approval, filing or

Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub.

       4.5 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. (a) Except for normal examinations conducted
by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has initiated any proceeding or, to the best
knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or operations of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 1998, except where such proceedings or
investigation is not reasonably likely, either individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. There is no unresolved violation,
criticism or exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or
statement relating to any examinations of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that, in the reasonable judgment of the Parent, is reasonably likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Parent.

or directive by, or has been since January 1, 1998, a recipient of any
super-


                                      -21-


<PAGE>


visory letter from, or since January 1, 1998, has adopted any board resolutions
at the request of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that
in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its
management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, a "Parent Regulatory Agreement"), nor has Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 1998, by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any such
Regulatory Agreement.

       (c) Parent and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 1998 with
all Regulatory Agencies, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable
in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration, statement or amendment or to pay such fees and assessments is not
reasonably likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

       4.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Copies of the consolidated balance sheets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, for the fiscal years 1998 and
1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years 1998 through 1999,
inclusive, as reported in Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1999 filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act (the
"Parent 10-K"), in each case accompanied by the audit report of Ernst & Young
LLP, independent accountants with respect to Parent, have previously been made
available to the Company. The December 31, 1999 consolidated balance sheet of
Parent (including the related notes, where applicable) fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of the date thereof, and the other financial statements referred
to in this Section 4.6 (including the related notes, where applicable) fairly
present in all material respects the results of the consolidated operations and
changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Parent
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth; each of such statements (including the related notes,
where applicable) complies in all material respects with applicable accounting

threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,
actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreement as to
which, in any such case, there is a reasonable probability of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, will have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

       (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction (other than those that apply generally to financial holding
companies, bank holding companies or banks) imposed upon Parent, any of its

will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

       4.10 SEC REPORTS. An accurate and complete copy of each (a) final
registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy
statement filed since January 1, 1997 by Parent with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the "Parent Reports") and prior to the date
hereof and (b) communication mailed by Parent to its shareholders since
January 1, 1997 and prior to the date hereof, has previously been made available
to the Company, and no such Parent Report or communication, as of the date
thereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date
hereof) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since
January 1, 1997, as of their respective dates, all Parent Reports filed under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

       4.11 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and
have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any respect under
any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline
of any Governmental Entity relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except
where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit or authorization or
such noncompliance or default will not, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

       4.12 UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except for those liabilities that are fully
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent
included in the Parent December 31,


                                      -23-

1999 Form 10-K and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, since December 31, 1999, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

       4.13 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. There are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result
in the imposition, on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or
obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal
environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation,
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended, pending or threatened against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, which liability or obligation will, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the knowledge of Parent,
there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or
governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that
will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Parent is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter
or memorandum by or with any Governmental Authority or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that will have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

       4.14 INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. All derivative
instruments, as such term is used in Statement of Financial Accounting STANDARDS
No. 133 (including without limitation interest rate swaps, caps, floors and
option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements), whether
entered into for the account of Parent or for the account of a customer of
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and in accordance with prudent banking
practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory
Authority and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the
time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies), and are in full force and effect. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
have duly performed in all material respects all of their material obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and to
Parent's knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults or
allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

       4.15 REORGANIZATION; POOLING OF INTERESTS As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that the Merger will not qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and as a
"pooling of interests" for accounting purposes.

       4.16 REGULATORY APPROVALS.  Parent has no reason to believe that any
required regulatory approvals in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby will not be obtained on a timely basis.

directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law.
The Company represents and warrants that it has ceased and caused to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties

       6.1 REGULATORY MATTERS. (a) The Company shall promptly prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with
the SEC the S-4. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and the Company shall thereafter mail or
deliver the Proxy Statement to its shareholders. Parent shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Company Common Shares as may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action.

       (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the Merger) and the Option Agreement, and to
comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent
shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each
will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries,
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights of review and
consultation, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Option Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.

       (c) The Company and Parent shall, upon request, promptly furnish each
other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and


                                      -29-


<PAGE>


such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

       (d) The Company and Parent shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Option Agreement that causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

       6.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the Company and
Parent, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the
other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of the other parties, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant
to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws
(other than reports or documents that Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may
reasonably request. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide such access or to disclose such
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Parent's or Merger Sub's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

       (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall hold all information furnished
by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party's Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required
by, and in accordance with, the provisions of confidentiality agreements, dated
October 20, 2000, between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreements").

       (c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other set
forth herein.

       6.3 SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL. The Company shall call a meeting of its
shareholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of
voting upon the requisite shareholder approval required in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Board of Directors of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause


                                      -30-


<PAGE>


this Agreement to be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding Company Common Shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that the
use of such reasonable best efforts shall not be deemed to require the Board of
Directors of the Company to maintain in place a recommendation that the
shareholders of the Company approve this Agreement or approve the transactions
contemplated hereby to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) such
action would violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company under applicable law.

       6.4 LEGAL CONDITIONS TO MERGER. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best
efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on
such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that
is required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall promptly take (or has taken prior to the date hereof) any and all action
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (including the Company Stock Plan) and
any award agreements thereunder to the extent such action is reasonably
necessary in order for the Merger to qualify for "pooling of interests"
accounting treatment.

       6.5 AFFILIATES; PUBLICATION OF COMBINED FINANCIAL Results. (a) Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (as
applicable, for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and for purposes
of qualifying the Merger for "pooling of interests" accounting treatment) of
such party to deliver to the other party hereto, as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the shareholders' meeting
called by the Company to approve this Agreement, a written agreement in the form
of Exhibit 6.5(a)(1) or (2), as applicable, hereto.

       (b) Parent shall use its best efforts to publish as promptly as
reasonably practical, but in no event later than 90 days after the end of the
first month after the Effective Time in which there are at least 30 days of
post-Merger combined operations (which month may be the month in which the
Effective Time occurs), combined sales and net income figures as contemplated by
and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting Series Release No. 135.

       6.6 STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING.  Parent shall cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

       6.7 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Parent agrees that, commencing at the
Effective Time, the benefit plans and programs applicable to the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "Covered
Employees") will be the benefit plans and programs provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent. Covered Employees who are terminated during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the 18-month anniversary
thereof shall be entitled to receive severance benefits in the amount of the
better of either (i) the sever-


                                      -31-


<PAGE>


ance benefits such Covered Employee would have been eligible to receive
under the Company's applicable benefit severance plan as in effect immediately
prior to the date hereof or (ii) the severance benefits such Covered Employee
would be eligible to receive under any applicable Parent severance plan
applicable to such employee in effect as of the date of termination of
employment, in all cases taking into account such Covered Employee's service
with the Company and Parent. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will recognize the prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time (the "Employees") in connection with all employee benefit
plans in which such Employees are eligible to participate following the
Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits (but
not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan).
From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will (i)
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under any group health plans of Surviving Corporation to be waived with respect
to the Employees and their eligible dependents (to the extent such conditions,
limitations or waiting periods have been otherwise satisfied under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan) and (ii) give each Employee credit for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits for eligible expenses incurred under the applicable
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

       (b) The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent agrees to honor in accordance
with their terms all benefits vested as of the Effective Time under the Company
Benefit Plans, including change-of-control benefits related to the Merger as
required by plans and agreements as in effect on the date hereof.

       (c) Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be interpreted as preventing the
Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any Company
Benefit Plans or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings,
in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

       6.8 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE. (a) In the event
of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
of its predecessors or (ii) this Agreement, the Option Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to
cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It
is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation, as and to the
fullest extent permitted by law) to each Indemnified Party, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.


                                      -32-


<PAGE>


       (b) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors
of the Company and each of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time (or the
period of the applicable statute of limitations, if longer) by the directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (PROVIDED that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in
their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be
obligated to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant
to this Section 6.8(b), any amount per annum in excess of 200% of the amount of
the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by Company for such insurance
(the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent
shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount.

       (c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

       (d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

       6.9 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of the
Company, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Parent, on the other hand) or to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company, the proper officers
and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries
shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at
the sole expense of, Parent.

       6.10 ADVICE OF CHANGES. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each
promptly advise the other parties of any change or event (i) having a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties
or covenants contained herein.

       6.11 EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 16(B). Assuming that the
Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information in a timely fashion prior
to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or a committee of
Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in
any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing in substance
that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for
Company Common Shares, and of options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock
upon conversion of op-


                                      -33-


<PAGE>


tions to purchase Company Common Shares, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in
the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so
exempt. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all respects
regarding the Company Insiders, the number of Company Common Shares held by each
such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the
Merger, and the number and description of the options to purchase Company Common
Shares held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into
options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger.
"Company Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of the Company who
are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

       7.1 CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER.  The
respective obligations of the parties to effect the Merger shall be subject to
the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

       (a) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall have been approved by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding Company Common Shares entitled to vote.

       (b) NYSE LISTING. The shares of Parent Common Stock that shall be issued
upon consummation of the Merger shall have been authorized for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

       (c) OTHER APPROVALS. All regulatory approvals required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained and shall remain in
full force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall
have expired (all such approvals and the expiration of all such waiting periods
being referred to herein as the "Requisite Regulatory Approvals").

       (d) S-4. The S-4 shall have become effective under the Securities Act and
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the S-4 shall have been issued and
no proceedings for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the
SEC.

       (e) NO INJUNCTIONS OR RESTRAINTS; ILLEGALITY. No order, injunction or
decree issued by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal
restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in effect. No
statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree shall have been enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by any Governmental Entity that prohibits,
materially restricts or makes illegal consummation of the Merger.

       (f) FEDERAL TAX OPINION. The Company shall have received an opinion from
Sullivan & Cromwell, and Parent shall have received an opinion from Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz, in


                                      -34-


<PAGE>


form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent,
respectively, in each case dated the Closing Date, substantially to the effect
that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in each
such opinion that are consistent with the state of facts existing at the
Effective Time:
              (i) The Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning
       of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
       will each be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section
       368(b) of the Code;

              (ii) No gain or loss will be recognized by the Company, Parent or
       Merger Sub as a result of the Merger other than mark-to-market gains and
       losses recognized upon the close of the Company's taxable year; and

              (iii) No gain or loss will be recognized by shareholders who
       exchange all of their Company Common Shares solely for shares of Parent
       Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (except with respect to cash received
       in lieu of a fractional share interest in Parent Common Stock).

In rendering such opinions, counsel may require and rely upon representations
contained in certificates of officers of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and
others.

       7.2 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The obligation of the
Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by
the Company, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

       (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in
all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the extent
such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that for purposes of this paragraph, such representations and warranties (other
than the representations set forth in Section 4.2(a), which shall be true in all
material respects) shall be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or
failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
either individually or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such
representations or warranties, has had or will have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of Parent to the foregoing effect.

       (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB. Parent and
Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by each of them under this Agreement at or prior to the
Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
Parent to such effect.

       7.3 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB. The obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger is also subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:


                                      -35-

<PAGE>


       (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the extent
such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that for purposes of this paragraph, such representations and warranties (other
than the representations set forth in Section 3.2(a), which shall be true in all
material respects) shall be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or
failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
either individually or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality set forth in such representations or warranties,
has had or will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the foregoing effect.

       (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The Company shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to such effect.

       (c) RECEIPT OF THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. All consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations (including without limitation waivers of termination rights) of
third parties (other than Governmental Entities) shall have been obtained other
than those the failure of which to obtain would not, and would not reasonably be
expected to, result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

       (d) POOLING OF INTERESTS. The Company and Parent shall each have received
a letter from their respective independent accountants addressed to the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, to the effect that the Merger will qualify for
"pooling of interests" accounting treatment; provided, however, that if Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries shall have taken any action that prevents such
qualification, this paragraph (d) shall not be a condition to the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

       8.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company:

       (a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument,
if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

       (b) by either the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of
Directors of Parent if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite
Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become
final and nonappealable or any Governmental


                                      -36-


<PAGE>


Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

       (c) by either the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of
Directors of Parent if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before
the date that is nine months after the date of this Agreement, unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein; or

       (d) by either the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of
Directors of Parent (provided that the terminating party is not then in breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein)
if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or the Company, in the case
of a termination by Parent, which breach, either individually or in the
aggregate, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the
failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be,
and that is not cured within 45 days following written notice to the party
committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the
Closing Date.

       8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of the Company or Parent, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections
6.2(b), 8.2, 9.2 and 9.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither the Company nor Parent shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of
this Agreement.

       8.3 AMENDMENT. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company; provided, however, that after any approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by the shareholders of the Company, there may
not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this
Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be
delivered hereunder to the holders of Company Common Shares, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

       8.4 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agree-


                                      -37-


<PAGE>


ments or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after any
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Shares entitled to vote, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof
that reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered
to the holders of Company Common Shares hereunder, other than as contemplated by
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

       9.1 CLOSING. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date
and at a place to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than five
business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of
the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, unless
extended by mutual agreement of the parties (the "Closing Date").

       9.2 NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Option
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements, which shall terminate in
accordance with the terms thereof) shall survive the Effective Time, except for
Section 6.8 and for those other covenants and agreements contained herein and
therein that by their terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

       9.3 EXPENSES. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, provided, however, that the costs and expenses of
printing and mailing the Proxy Statement, and all filing and other fees paid to
the SEC in connection with the Merger, shall be borne equally by the Company and
Parent.

       9.4 NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (with
confirmation), mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
or delivered by an express courier (with confirmation) to the parties at the
following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified
