of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
hereunder shall take place at the offices of Dechert LLP in New York,

after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or
at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree in writing. If the
Closing would otherwise occur during the third month of any fiscal quarter
of Seller, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall mutually agree in
writing on an alternative date not occurring in such month for the Closing.
At the Closing: (a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller (for the account of Seller
and on behalf of Business Subsidiary) the Purchase Price to the bank account
designated by Seller in writing at least three Business Days prior to
the Closing and (b) the Parties hereby agree to deliver, or cause to be
delivered, such documents, certificates of officers and other instruments as

effect the transfer by Seller and by Business Subsidiary of the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities pursuant to and as contemplated by this

Section 2.07. _Conveyances and Assumptions; Further Assurances; Accounts
Receivable Collections_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no ownership or right to use Pre-Migration Job
Seeker Data shall transfer to Buyer unless and until a Migration Event has
occurred with respect to such data. For purposes of this Agreement, "Migration
Event" means, as applicable to each Job Seeker following the Closing, (i)
the 

  

    ##### 

  

  

notification of the change of ownership of the Site, (ii) the invitation to
such Job Seeker to become a Buyer user with respect to such data and (iii)
acceptance of such invitation by "opting in" to the transfer of ownership of
applicable Pre-Migration Job Seeker Data from Seller to Buyer pursuant to
procedures as agreed by the Parties in connection with the Transition
Services Agreement and the Data Migration Project Plan thereunder. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject in all respects to Section 2.07(a), to the extent that the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempt thereof to Buyer of
any asset that would be a Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any
Applicable Law or would require any Governmental Authority or third party
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers (a "Non-Assignable Asset",
which shall in no event include Pre-Migration Job Seeker Data), and the same
shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts, and cooperate with each other, to
obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that none of Seller or Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to pay any consideration therefor,
other than filing, recordation or similar fees, which shall be shared equally
by Seller and Buyer. Subject to the matters set forth on Schedule 2.07(b),
pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of use and any
related obligations of such Non-Assignable Asset and to Seller or Business
Subsidiary the benefits, including any indemnities, that would have been
obtained had the Non-Assignable Asset been conveyed to Buyer at Closing. Once
authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such Non-Assignable Asset
is obtained, Seller shall or shall cause Business Subsidiary to, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver such asset, claim, right or benefit to Buyer at
no additional cost, other than filing, recordation or similar fees,
which shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. Subject to the matters set
forth on Schedule 2.07(b), to the extent that any such material Non-
Assignable Asset cannot be transferred or the full benefits of use of any
such material Non-Assignable Asset cannot be provided to Buyer following
the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.07(b), then Buyer and Seller shall
enter into such commercially reasonable arrangements (including sublicensing
or subcontracting) to provide to the Parties hereto the economic equivalent
and, in Sellers sole discretion the commercially reasonable
operational equivalent, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver and the performance by Buyer of the obligations thereunder, each
to the extent permitted and taking into account related Tax and other
applicable costs and benefits. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof,
all income, proceeds and other monies received by Seller or
Business Subsidiary in connection with respective use of any Non-Assignable
Asset (net of any Taxes and any other costs imposed upon Seller or Business
Subsidiary) in connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.07(b).
Buyer shall reimburse Seller promptly for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and obligations incurred by Seller or Business Subsidiary (net
of any Taxes and any other benefits received by Seller or Business
Subsidiary) in connection with Sellers or Business Subsidiarys use of any
Non-Assignable Asset in connection with the arrangements under this Section
2.07(b). 

  

(c) Buyer or Seller may request that the Parties consider appropriate
revisions to the 

 

    ##### 

  

  

 Purchased Assets, Licensed IP Rights or Licensed Technology Assets, and,
with respect to clause (i) below, Assumed Liabilities and the Business
Employees: 

  

(i) between the date hereof and Closing, in order to revise such lists or
update such assets and liabilities to account for applicable changes in the
Ordinary Course consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements; _provided_ that (A) all such changes are requested and mutually
agreed in writing no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing and
(B) with respect to Assigned Contracts, Purchased Tangible Assets (if any)
and Assigned Pre-Payments (if any), the Parties hereby agree that such lists
shall automatically be deemed (without requiring the consent or request of
any Party) not to include applicable Purchased Assets that are no longer in
effect, owned or in existence as of the Closing, to the extent such changes
(including terminations pursuant to the lapse or non-renewal of the then-
current term of any Assigned Contract) are consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; and 

   

(ii) such that material Technology and Materials, and Copyrights related
thereto, Patents, Trademarks, Domain Names and other types of Purchased
Assets not included in such categories as of the date hereof, are included or
deemed included as of the Closing;  _provided_ that (A) with respect to
Patents, Trademarks, and Domain Names, all such changes must be requested and
mutually agreed in writing no later than the fifth Business Day prior to
Closing and (B) with respect to Technology and Materials, and
Copyrights related thereto, and all other types of Purchased Assets, all such
changes must be requested and mutually agreed in writing no later than three
months following Closing. 

  

The non-requesting Party shall consider and accommodate, as appropriate (or
cause to be considered and accommodated, as appropriate) any such request in
good faith to the extent reasonably requested, taking into account (i) the
extent to which any asserted inaccurately categorized or omitted asset, right
or property is (A) Exclusive to or material to the operation of the
Business or (B) used by Seller in its services and businesses other than the
Business, including its search and advertising functions (other than Job
Exclusive Search) and (ii) the general methodology used by the Parties as of
the date hereof in connection with determination of the lists
and categorization of Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Licensed IP
Rights or Licensed Technology Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for
the avoidance of doubt, any changes described in clause (i)(B) of this
Section 2.07(c) with respect to terminations pursuant to the lapse or non-
renewal of the then-current term of any Assigned Contract shall
happen automatically and without the need for consideration by the Parties. 

  

(d) Subject to this Section 2.07 and the Ancillary Agreements, Buyer and
Seller each hereby agree, without further consideration, to execute and
deliver, following the Closing, and to cause their Subsidiaries to execute
and deliver as applicable, such other instruments of transfer and take such
other commercially reasonable action as each of Buyer or Seller (or respective
counsel) may reasonably request (including any actions necessary to record
with the appropriate Governmental Authority the assignment to Buyer of the
Purchased Intellectual Property Rights) in order to (i) transfer to Buyer the
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities and (ii) maintain with Seller or
the Business Subsidiary the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities, each
in 

 

    ##### 

  

  

accordance with this Agreement. Buyer and Seller each hereby agree, without
further consideration, to take, or cause to be taken, such other commercially
reasonable action following the Closing and execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, such other commercially reasonable documents as
Buyer or Seller (or respective counsel) may reasonably request in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. 

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.07(d), from and after the
Closing, Seller, Business Subsidiary and/or their designee, shall at all
times have the right and authority to collect for Sellers or Business
Subsidiarys account, all Excluded Assets set forth in Section 2.02(a) and
Buyer shall, within 15 Business Days after receipt of any payment in respect
of any such Excluded Assets, deliver and/or remit to Seller any documents,
cash or checks received on account of or otherwise relating to any such
Excluded Assets. Seller and Business Subsidiary shall, within 15 Business
Days after receipt of any payment in respect of any Purchased
Assets constituting accounts receivable generated by Buyer after the Closing,
deliver and/or remit to Buyer any documents, cash or checks received on
account of or otherwise relating to any such accounts receivable. 

  

(f) With respect to any Purchased Assets that are computer software or are
otherwise determined to constitute "prewritten programs" within the meaning
of the California Sales and Use Tax Regulations (collectively, the "Purchased
Software"), Buyer and Seller shall (and, to the extent appropriate, Seller
shall cause Business Subsidiary to) take all steps necessary to ensure that
the transfer of the Purchased Software is not subject to California sales or
use Tax, including transferring the Purchased Software either (i) by remote
telecommunications (where Buyer does not obtain possession of any tangible
personal property, such as storage media, in connection with the transfer) or
(ii) by Seller (and, to the extent appropriate, Business
Subsidiary) installing the Purchased Software on Buyers computers without
providing any storage media to Buyer in connection with the transfer.

warranty of Seller that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the

material Applicable Law applicable to the Business or the Purchased Assets,

(c) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one another in (i) determining
whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from third parties to any material contracts in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
taking such actions or furnishing information required in connection therewith
and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers. 

  

(d) Buyer and/or its designated Subsidiary shall, prior to the Closing,
execute and deliver to applicable parties such written instruments assuming
all of Sellers and Business Subsidiarys obligations and covenants under the
agreements set forth on Schedule 5.02(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as
may be required, and to provide such information and take all other action as
may be required, pursuant to such agreements in connection with the
contemplated succession of the ownership and operation of the Business and
Business Subsidiary as contemplated by this Agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Seller. 

  

(e) Neither Party shall take any action, or enter into any transaction or any
agreement 

  

    ##### 

  

   

to effect any transaction (including any acquisition, but excluding any
action, transaction, agreement or acquisition (and subsequent actions with
respect thereto) publicly announced prior to the date hereof and excluding
transactions or agreements in the ordinary course of business), that
would reasonably be expected to make it more difficult to: (i) obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the Traffic Agreement, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement
of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would prevent the
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Traffic Agreement, (iii) obtain any regulatory approval of
a Governmental Authority, in each case prior to the Termination Date or (iv)
satisfy any material obligations of such Party pursuant to Article 5 of this
Agreement or closing conditions of such Party pursuant to Article 6 of this
Agreement. 

  

Section 5.03. _Access to Information_. (a) From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, in addition to performance obligations of this Agreement and to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer and Seller will each (i)
give the other Party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties,
books and records of, as applicable, the Business or Buyer, (ii) furnish to
the other Party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other

other Party in its investigation of, as applicable, the Business or Buyer;
_provided_  however, that all access and information rights shall be limited
in the case of Buyer, to the extent reasonably requested in connection with
any reasonable business purpose related to its proposed acquisition of the
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities and use of the Licensed IP Rights,
Licensed Technology Assets and Transition Services Technology Assets following
the Closing, and in the case of Seller, to the extent reasonably requested in
connection with any reasonable business purpose related to its proposed sale
of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities and transfer of the Licensed
IP Rights, Licensed Technology Assets and Transition Services
Technology Assets following the Closing; _provided_ further, that the Parties
hereby agree that litigation or pre-litigation discovery as relates to any
dispute or potential dispute relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements, the Traffic Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby among the Parties or their Affiliates shall not
be a "reasonable business purpose" or a "reasonable request" of any Party.
Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted only on
reasonable advance notice during regular business hours and in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the businesses of the non-
requesting Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall have
access to, to the extent applicable, (i) personnel records of either Party
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories
or other information which in such Partys good faith opinion is sensitive or
the disclosure of which could subject such Party to risk of liability pursuant
to Applicable Law or otherwise, (ii) personal or user data or materials the
provision of which would be in contravention of privacy agreements or
policies of the applicable Party or its Affiliates, (iii) materials
designated as competitively sensitive or attorney-client privileged or (iv)
any other third Person or Party technology or confidential information
expressly restricted from disclosure pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements or the Traffic Agreement following the Closing. The
Party conducting such 

  

    ##### 

  

   

information request shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead,
salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with
the foregoing. 

  

(b) On and after the Closing Date, in addition to performance obligations of
this Agreement, applicable Ancillary Agreements and the Traffic Agreement and
subject to Applicable Law, (A) Buyer will, in connection with any audit,
investigation, indemnification matter, dispute or other Proceeding or any
other reasonable business purpose of Seller, afford promptly to Seller and
its agents reasonable access to the books and records in the possession of
Buyer pertaining to the operation of the Business prior to the Closing or
pertaining to the collection by Seller of accounts receivable that are
Excluded Assets pursuant to Sections 2.02(a) and 2.07(e) of this Agreement
and (B) Seller will, in connection with any audit, investigation,
indemnification matter, dispute or other Proceeding or any other reasonable
business purpose of Buyer and in each case as reasonably requested by Buyer,
afford promptly to Buyer and its agents reasonable access to the books and
records in the possession of Seller pertaining to the operation of the
Business prior to the Closing and, following the Closing, pertaining to the
Licensed IP Rights, Licensed Technology Assets and Transition Services
Technology Assets; _provided_ that the Parties hereby agree that litigation
or pre-litigation discovery as relates to any dispute or potential dispute
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the
Traffic Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby among
the Parties or their Affiliates shall not be a "reasonable business purpose"
or a "reasonable request" of any Party. Any such access by Buyer or Seller
shall be permitted only on reasonable advance notice during regular business
hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall have
access to, to the extent applicable (i) personnel records of either Party
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories
or other information which in such Partys good faith opinion is sensitive or
the disclosure of which could subject such Party to risk of liability
pursuant to Applicable Law or otherwise, (ii) personal or user data or
materials the provision of which would be in contravention of
privacy agreements or policies of the applicable Party or its Affiliates,
(iii) materials designated as competitively sensitive or attorney-
client privileged or (iv) any other third Person or Party technology or
confidential information expressly restricted from disclosure pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Traffic Agreement
following the Closing. The Party conducting such information request shall
bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees,
but excluding reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee
benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with the foregoing. 

  

Section 5.04. _Notices of Certain Events_. Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall each promptly notify the other Party of: 

  

(a) (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
Traffic Agreement or (ii) any written agreement or other instrument that, if
existing on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.05; 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or the Traffic Agreement; 

  

(c) any Proceedings commenced relating to Seller or Buyer that, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.09 or Section 4.05, as applicable; and 

  

(d) any material claim relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities that, if existing on the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.14. 

  

Section 5.05. _Confidentiality_. The Parties acknowledge that Buyer and Seller
have previously executed a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement dated October 16,
2008 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), (i) which shall continue in full
force and effect (along with the confidentiality provisions of the exclusivity
and confidentiality letter agreement among the Parties dated as of August 7,
2009 (the "Exclusivity Agreement")) with respect to all applicable
information furnished by each Party and its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives by or on behalf of such Party to the other
Party and its representatives, (ii) Section 12 of which is hereby amended to
delete clause (a) thereof and amend clause (b) thereof such that the
applicable term runs for thirty-six months following the date of this
Agreement and (iii) Section 7 of which is hereby amended to amend the first
sentence thereof such that the applicable term runs for twenty-four months
following the date of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall be fully liable
and responsible under the Confidentiality Agreement and the Exclusivity
Agreement for any breach of the terms and conditions thereof by their
respective subsidiaries, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) following the
Closing Date all confidentiality provisions of applicable Ancillary
Agreements and the Traffic Agreement shall govern with respect to information
provided or exchanged thereunder, without regard to this Section 5.05 or the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Exclusivity Agreement and (ii) from and
after the Closing Date, the Parties hereby agree that Section 7 of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no further force and effect. 

  

Section 5.06. _Public Announcements; Disclosure_. The initial press release or
press statement to be issued by either Party with respect to this Agreement,
the Traffic Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
shall be mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller. Thereafter, (i) none of the
Parties shall (and each of the Parties shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives not to) issue any press release or make any public
announcement or public disclosure concerning this Agreement, the Traffic
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii)
Buyer shall not publicly disclose any Ancillary Agreement or the Traffic
Agreement, in each case, without obtaining the prior written consent of (a)
Seller, in the event the disclosing party is Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or representatives or (b) Buyer, in the event the disclosing party is Seller
or any of its Affiliates or representatives, in each case, with such consent
not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld; _provided_ however,
that if a Party determines, based upon advice of counsel, that a press
release, public announcement, other public disclosure or disclosure of any
Ancillary Agreement or the Traffic 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Agreement is required by, or reasonably necessary in order to comply
with, Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of a national securities
exchange, such Party may make such press release, public announcement or
other public disclosure, in which case the disclosing Party shall (i) provide
prompt written notice to the non-disclosing Party of any such disclosure and
(ii) provide timely opportunity for review and reasonable consultation and
cooperation with the non-disclosing Party in connection with any such
disclosure or decision, efforts or submission of materials to any applicable
Governmental Authority or other third party which seeks to contest, limit or
seek confidential treatment with respect to such disclosure (including,
without limitation, promptly providing the non-disclosing Party with copies
of any correspondence the disclosing Party receives from any applicable
Governmental Authority or other third party relating thereto), it being
agreed that reasonable consultation and cooperation shall include the
acceptance and incorporation by the disclosing Party of any reasonable
requests or comments made by the non-disclosing Party in connection with any
such disclosure or submission of such materials, as well as any responses or
correspondence with any applicable Governmental Authority or other
third party in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
information set forth in a press release or public disclosure which has been
consented to by the non-disclosing Party pursuant to this Section 5.06 may be
re-communicated in a subsequent press release, or public disclosure without
requiring additional consent. 

  

Section 5.07. _No Solicitation._ (a) Until the earlier of the Closing or the
date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller
shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, Subsidiaries or other representatives to, either directly
or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage or facilitate any inquiry,
proposal or offer from, or participate or engage in or conduct any
discussions or negotiations with, any Person relating to any inquiry,
contact, proposal or offer, whether oral, written or by any other means,
formal or informal, involving (A) any acquisition of the material assets of
the Business or any material Purchased Assets or any capital stock of
Business Subsidiary or any transaction similar to the arrangement described
herein that would have the effect of precluding the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (B) a commercial arrangement materially
similar to that contemplated by the Traffic Agreement (each such inquiry,
contact, offer or proposal, a "Competing Proposal or Inquiry"), (ii) provide
any information concerning the Business or any of the Purchased Assets to any
Person in response to a Competing Proposal or Inquiry (or which could
reasonably be expected to be used to formulate or evaluate a Competing
Proposal or Inquiry), (iii) approve, agree to or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principal or Contract with
any Person with respect to a Competing Proposal or Inquiry or (iv) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation, solicitation or endorsement in
support of any Competing Proposal or Inquiry. Seller shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any contacts, discussions, negotiations and other
activities with any Person relating to any Competing Proposal or Inquiry.
Seller agrees to inform Buyer in writing within three Business Days following
the receipt by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any written proposal, offer
or bid (specifying the material financial terms thereof) that constitutes a
Competing Proposal or Inquiry at a valuation greater than that contemplated
by this Agreement. 

  

(b) In no event shall Section 5.07(a) prohibit or restrict Seller from
engaging in any discussions, negotiations or information exchange, entering
into or approving any Contract or 

  

    ##### 

  

   

otherwise supporting activity related to a sale, transfer or license of any
other assets or equity of, or any type of commercial arrangement with respect
to, Seller or any other Subsidiaries, divisions or businesses of Seller other
than the Business or Purchased Assets. 

  

Section 5.08. _Employee Matters_. (a) No less than 30 calendar days prior to
the expected Closing Date, or such later date as shall be mutually agreed in
writing between Buyer and Seller, Buyer shall extend a written offer of
employment to those certain Business Employees set forth on Schedule 5.08(a).
Buyer may update Schedule 5.08(a) at any time up to 60 calendar days prior to
the expected Closing Date, or such later date as shall be mutually agreed in
writing between Buyer and Seller, by providing written notice to Seller;
_provided_ that, Schedule 5.08(a) may be further amended by Buyer after such
time to remove any Business Employee who ceases to be an employee of Seller or
a Seller Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date and Buyer may add up to an
equal number, or such greater number as to which Seller consents in writing,
of additional Business Employees to Schedule 5.08(a) to replace the
individuals so removed (except for individuals so removed who have become
employees or contractors of Buyer or a Buyer Subsidiary, unless otherwise
consented to by Seller in writing). Each such written offer of employment
shall include compensation and benefits substantially similar and no less
favorable in the aggregate as provided to such Business Employee by Seller
or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller, each such offer shall as
a condition to acceptance provide that the Business Employee who accepts an
offer of employment from Buyer in accordance with this Section 5.08(a) shall
resign his or her employment with Seller or Seller Affiliate (as applicable)
as of the Closing Date and commence his or her employment with Buyer the
following day. With respect to any Business Employee (i) who does not become
a Transferred Employee, and (ii) whose employment by Seller or
its Subsidiaries is terminated within 90 calendar days following the Closing
Date ("Severed Business Employees"), Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the
Severance Costs. After Seller has paid all Severance Costs, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer an invoice for such Severance Costs, which invoice shall
include (i) the Severance Cost applicable to each Severed Business Employee,
(ii) a certification that such Severance Costs were actually paid to the
Severed Business Employees, and (iii) a certification that the employment by
Seller or its Subsidiaries of such Severed Business Employees was actually
terminated within 90 calendar days following the Closing Date. Buyer
shall make such payment of Severance Costs to Seller within 30 calendar days
of Buyers receipt of an invoice that reasonably complies with the
requirements of the preceding sentence. With respect to each Business
Employee other than Transferred Employees or Severed Business Employees,
Seller shall be liable for, and Buyer shall have no liability for, any
severance costs. 

  

(b) Promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) following the final
post-Closing retention payment period set forth in Schedule 5.08(c), each of
Buyer and Seller shall provide the other Party with written documentation
setting forth the aggregate amount of such Retention Arrangements paid
pursuant to Schedule 5.08(c) (which shall include applicable calculations
and reasonable documentation supporting such payments) (the "Retention
Payment Invoices"). The aggregate Retention Payment Invoices of both Buyer
and Seller shall not exceed $2,100,000 (inclusive of withholding amounts).
Within three Business Days following receipt of both Retention Payment
Invoices, Buyer shall remit payment to Seller in the amount of one-half of the
payments made by Seller pursuant to Parts (A)(1) and (A)(3) of Schedule
5.08(c) 

  

    ##### 

  

   

(such payment, the "Retention True Up Payment"). Such Retention True Up
Payment will be made promptly (and in any event within three Business Days
after the Retention True Up Payment amount is determined) and shall be paid
in cash or via wire-transfer to an account designated by Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent either Buyer or Seller makes retention
payments or arrangements other than as provided pursuant to this Section
5.08(b) or Schedule 5.08(c), any such retention payments or arrangements
shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the reimbursement between
Buyer and Seller and the Party committing to such retention payments or
arrangements shall be solely responsible for the cost thereof. In no event
shall Buyer be responsible for reimbursing Seller more than (i) 50% of the
aggregate Retention Arrangement Payments made by Seller pursuant to
Parts (A)(1) and (A)(3) of Schedule 5.08(c) or (ii) the amount equal to the
difference between $1,050,000 and the aggregate amount paid by Buyer pursuant
to Part A(2)(b) of Schedule 5.08(c). In no event shall Seller be responsible
for making aggregate retention payments pursuant to this Schedule 5.08(c) of
more than $1,050,000 (as offset by any applicable Retention True Up Payment
required hereunder). 

  

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize the prior
service with Seller and its Affiliates, including prior service with
predecessor employers where such prior service is recognized by Seller as of
immediately prior to the Closing, of each Transferred Employee in connection
with all employee benefit plans, programs or policies (other than under an
equity, equity derivative or deferred compensation plan, program or policy)
of Buyer or its Affiliates in which Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
determination of level of benefits (but not to the extent that such
recognition would result in duplication of benefits or with respect to any
defined benefit plan). From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to cause any pre- existing conditions or limitations
and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Buyer or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents to the extent such Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents were not subject to such preexisting conditions and
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under the comparable Seller
Benefit Plans as of immediately preceding the Closing. 

  

(d) Buyer shall take all steps necessary to permit each Transferred Employee
who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section
402(c)(4) of the Code) from the 401(k) plan maintained by Seller, if any, to
roll such eligible rollover distribution, excluding any associated loans, as
part of any lump sum distribution to the extent permitted by the 401(k)
plan maintained by Seller into an account under a 401(k) plan maintained by
Buyer. 

  

(e) Seller shall be responsible for providing any Business Employee whose
"qualifying event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code,
occurs on or prior to the Closing Date (and such employees "qualified
beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code) with the
continuation of group health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code
("Continuation Coverage") under the terms of Sellers health plans. Buyer
shall be responsible for Continuation Coverage to any Transferred Employee
(and each such employees qualified beneficiaries) whose qualifying event
occurs after the Closing Date to the extent required by law. 

  

(f) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of
employee 

 

    ##### 

  

  

 layoffs and terminations, by location, implemented by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries in the ninety (90) day period preceding the Closing Date with
respect to employees primarily engaged in the Business. For each layoff or
termination on such list, Seller shall identify the date on which such layoff
or termination occurred, and the reason for the layoff or termination. 

  

(g) Seller shall notify Buyer if any Business Employee identified on Section
5.08(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule who has been provided a written
offer of employment by Buyer (the "Key Employees") notifies Seller in writing
of such Key Employees intention to, before or within 30 days after the
Closing, terminate employment with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or with
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a termination of employment with
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the acceptance by such
Key Employee of an offer of employment from Buyer). 

  

No provision of this Section 5.08 shall create any third party beneficiary or
other rights in any employee or former employee of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller in respect of continued or resumed employment in the Business, or with
Seller, Buyer, or any Affiliate of Buyer or Seller. No provision of this
Section 5.08 shall create any rights in any such persons in respect of
any benefits that may be provided under any Seller Benefit Plan or any plan
or arrangement which may be established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates, shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify a Seller
Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement nor
shall require Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan and any such plan may be amended or terminated in
accordance with its terms and Applicable Law. 

  

Section 5.09. _Tax Matters._ (a) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to each other, upon reasonable request, such information
relating to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities (including
reasonable access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns relating to Taxes levied upon the Purchased Assets,
the making of any election relating to Taxes levied upon the Purchased
Assets, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any Proceeding relating to any Tax levied upon the
Purchased Assets. Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and records with
respect to Taxes levied upon the Purchased Assets for a period of at least
six years following the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other, to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
the conduct of any audit or other Proceeding relating to Taxes levied upon
the Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 5.03(b) of this Agreement. Any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.09(a) shall be held in strict
confidence and shall be used solely in connection with the reason for which
it was requested. 

  

(b) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar _ad valorem_
obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a Straddle Period
(collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned based on
the number of days of such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the number of days of such Straddle Period after the Closing
Date (any such portion of such taxable period, the "Post-Closing Tax
Period"). Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-
Closing Tax Period. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) All excise, sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording,
documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer, gains and similar
Taxes, levies, charges and fees incurred in connection with the purchase of
assets contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall
be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully
in providing each other with any appropriate resale exemption certificates and
other similar documentation and in minimizing any Transfer Taxes to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law. Seller shall prepare and file all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to any Transfer Taxes for which
Seller and Buyer are liable under this Agreement, and Buyer shall pay to
Seller Buyers share of such Transfer Taxes at the time such documentation is
to be filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority and such Transfer Taxes are
to be paid (and in no event later than ten calendar days thereafter, with any
payment not made within such time bearing interest at the then-current short-
term applicable federal rate, compounded annually, for each calendar day
until paid). In the case that Applicable Law does not allow Seller, and
instead requires Buyer, to file a Tax Return with respect to a Transfer Tax
for which Seller or Buyer is liable under this Agreement, Seller shall
prepare such Tax Return, present such Tax Return to Buyer for review
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed
or withheld), and Buyer shall sign and file (or cause the appropriate person
to sign and file) such Tax Return and pay all related Transfer Taxes
associated therewith, and Seller shall pay to Buyer Sellers share of
such Transfer Taxes at the time such documentation is to be filed with the
appropriate Taxing Authority and such Transfer Taxes are to be paid (and in
no event later than ten calendar days thereafter, with any payment not made
within such time bearing interest at the then-current short-term applicable
federal rate, compounded annually, for each calendar day until paid). 

  

(d) Apportioned Obligations shall be timely paid, and all applicable filings,
reports and returns shall be filed, as provided by Applicable Law. The paying
Party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying Party in
accordance with Section 5.09(b) of this Agreement. Upon payment of any such
Apportioned Obligation, the paying Party shall present a statement to
the non-paying Party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the
paying Party is entitled under Section 5.09(b) of this Agreement together
with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the
amount to be reimbursed; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
Apportioned Obligation that is paid or payable upon the filing of a Tax
Return, in addition to any statement, the paying Party shall furnish the non-
paying Party with a copy of such Tax Return. The non-paying Party shall make
such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than ten calendar days
after the presentation of such statement. Any payment not made within such
time shall bear interest at the then-current short-term applicable federal
rate, compounded annually, for each calendar day until paid. 

  

(e) (i) _Tax Claims Generally_. If a Tax Claim is made or threatened by any
Taxing Authority that, if successful, may result in an indemnity payment
under Section 7.02(a)(iii) of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller, stating the nature and basis of such claim and the amount thereof, to
the extent known. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve Seller
from any liability that it may have on account of this indemnification or
otherwise, except to the extent that Seller is prejudiced in the defense of
such claim thereby. 

   

(ii) _Claims for Taxes other than Apportioned Obligations and Transfer
Taxes_. If Seller acknowledges its indemnification liability for such claim,
Seller will have the 

  

    ##### 

  

   

right, at its option, upon timely notice to Buyer, to assume at its own
expense with its own counsel control of any audit or other defense of any Tax
Claim other than a Tax Claim relating solely to either any Apportioned
Obligations or any Transfer Taxes. Sellers right to control a Tax Claim
(other than a Tax Claim relating solely to either any Apportioned Obligations
or any Transfer Taxes) will be limited to issues in respect of which amounts
in dispute would be paid by Seller or for which Seller would be liable under
Section 7.02(a)(iii) of this Agreement. Costs of such Tax Claims are to be
borne by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Seller shall neither
consent nor agree to the settlement of any Tax Claim with respect to any
liability for Taxes that would reasonably be expected to affect the liability
for any Taxes with respect to the Purchased Assets for any Post-Closing Tax
Period without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld, and (y) neither Seller, nor any
entity related to Seller, shall file an amended Tax Return that would
reasonably be expected to increase the liability for Taxes with respect to
the Purchased Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld. 

   

(iii) _Claims for Apportioned Obligations or Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and
Seller shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax
Claims for Apportioned Obligations or any Transfer Taxes and each Party shall
bear its own out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the contest and all joint
costs and expenses of the contest shall be borne in the same ratio as the
applicable proposed Apportioned Obligation or Transfer Tax would be
allocated. 

   

(iv) _Coordination with Defense of Third Party Claims._ To the extent there
is any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this Section 5.09(e) and
Section 7.04 (Defense of Third Party Claims), the provisions of this Section
5.09(e) shall control. 

  

Section 5.10. _Non-Compete; Employee Non-Solicit_. (a) For a period of three
years from the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of any
business engaged in the Business (whether or not conducted through the Site)
in the United States (the "Restricted Business"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) Seller and such
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to acquire, own and manage a majority
ownership interest of a Person that operates a Restricted Business (other
than a business listed in Schedule 5.10) but whose principal line of business
is not a Restricted Business; _provided_ that while this Section 5.10 remains
in effect (A) Seller shall not, and shall not permit such acquired Person to,
use the Yahoo! name or brand to directly promote or directly market the
Restricted Business portion or activities of such acquired Person, (B) annual
gross revenues from such Restricted Business do not exceed $35 million, and

shall be responsible for all costs and expenses related to the preparation of
such audited financial statements incurred by Seller or its Affiliates,
including the audit services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or any other
third party services engaged by Seller, and Buyer shall be responsible for
all costs and expenses of outside advisors retained by Buyer related to the

Regulation S-X under the Securities Act), such that Buyers analysis can be
timely completed prior to any applicable deadline for any such SEC reporting
obligation, and in no event later than the Closing Date. Buyer shall, in good
faith in accordance with Applicable Law and upon advice of its outside counsel
and auditors and its reasonable consultation with Seller, take reasonable
steps, including communication and/or correspondence with SEC staff, to seek

matters set forth in the update, and, if the Closing shall occur, Buyer shall
have waived any right or claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
otherwise with respect to any and all matters disclosed pursuant to the

agreement relating to Sellers businesses other than the Business, between
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a content provider,

to issue, within 90 calendar days following the Closing, a written notice to
each counterparty of a General Business Development Distribution Agreement or
a General Content License Agreement waiving Sellers or any of its
Subsidiaries right to, or right to enforce, any Advertising Restriction or
any Content Restriction during the three year period following the Closing. 

  

(c) Seller agrees, during the three year period following the Closing, to
use 

  

    ##### 

  

   

commercially reasonable efforts not to include Buyer or any of its Affiliates
in any Advertising Restriction or any Content Restriction in any General
Business Development Distribution Agreements or General Content License
Agreements entered into after the Closing Date;  _provided_ that,
such commercially reasonable efforts shall include altering the applicable
standard form contracts used by Seller and its Subsidiaries and instructing

reasonable efforts shall not include the review or supervision of each
employee authorized to enter into General Business Development Distribution
Agreements or General Content License Agreements. 

  

(d) Seller, for the benefit of Buyer, agrees, during the three year period

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations with respect to the amount of

knowing and intentional misrepresentation of a fact material to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement made with the intent of inducing
any other Party hereto to enter into this Agreement and upon which such other
Party has relied (as opposed to any fraud claim based on constructive
knowledge, negligent misrepresentation or a similar theory) under applicable
tort laws. The indemnity provided for in this Section 7.02 is not limited to
matters asserted by third parties against the Indemnified Party, but includes
any Damages incurred or sustained by any Indemnified Party in the absence of
Third Party Claims. 

  

Section 7.03. _Procedures; Disputes_. (a) The party seeking indemnification
pursuant to Section 7.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt
notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim (a "Claim"), or the
commencement of any Proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under Section 7.02 and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information
with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, unless (and then solely to
the extent) such failure shall have materially adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party. In connection with any Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a certificate signed by any officer
of the Indemnified Party (any certificate delivered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 7.03(a) an "Officers Claim Certificate"): 

   

(i) stating that an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Article 7; 

   

(ii) to the extent possible, contain a good faith non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled
to receive, which shall be the amount of Damages such Indemnified Party
claims to have so incurred; and 

   

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by such Person) the material facts known to the Indemnified Party
giving rise to such Claim. 

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party in good faith objects to any claim made by the
Indemnified Party in any Officers Claim Certificate, then the Indemnifying
Party shall deliver a written notice (a "Claim Dispute Notice") to the
Indemnified Party during the 30 calendar day period commencing upon receipt
by the Indemnifying Party of the Officers Claim Certificate. The Claim
Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the principal basis for
the dispute of any Claim made by the Indemnified Party in the Officers Claim
Certificate. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver a Claim Dispute
Notice to the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of such 30 calendar
day period, then the Indemnifying Party shall promptly wire cash in
immediately available funds to the Indemnified Party in the amount of the
Damages set forth in 

  

    ##### 

  

   

the Officers Claim Certificate;  _provided_ however, that required delivery
of funds may be delayed to the extent required by the Indemnifying Party in
order to comply with any notification and approval requirements of
any applicable insurer of such Indemnifying Party, so long as written notice
of such delay is reasonably provided by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of such 30 calendar day period. 

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, then the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any objections raised by the Indemnifying Party in such Claim Dispute
Notice. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to a
resolution of such objection, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall
be prepared and signed by both parties and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly wire cash in immediately available funds to the Indemnified Party in
the amount of the Damages set forth in accordance with the terms of such
memorandum. 

  

(d) If no such resolution can be reached during the 30 calendar day period
following the Indemnified Partys receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice,
then upon the expiration of such 30 calendar day period, either the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party may bring suit to resolve the
objection in accordance with Sections 9.05, 9.06 and 9.07. The decision of the
trial court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers
Claim Certificate shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and, as applicable, the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly wire cash in immediately available funds
to the Indemnified Party in the amount of the Damages set forth in accordance
therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction. 

  

Section 7.04. _Defense of Third Party Claims_. (a) The right to control and/or
the right participate in the defense and/or settlement of a Claim or
Proceeding asserted by a third party (a "Third Party Claim") shall be
allocated between the Parties with respect to specific matters as follows: 

   

(i) Seller shall at all times control and appoint lead counsel for the defense
and/or settlement, in each case at its own expense, of Third Party Claims
related to (A) Excluded Assets, (B) Excluded Liabilities and (C) matters
listed on Schedule 7.04; _provided_  however, that the Parties hereby agree
that clauses (A) and (B) shall include any Third Party Claim related to any
Seller service or business not exclusively related to the Business. Buyer may
participate, at its own expense and to the extent applicable, in any such
Third Party Claim to the extent Buyer or its Affiliates are joined as and
remain a party to such claim; _provided_ however, that with respect to any
such Third Party Claim that relates to activities and obligations of the
Business during _both_ the period before the Closing _and_ the period after
the Closing, Seller shall reimburse Buyers participation expenses to the
extent related to matters pursuant to which Seller is obligated to indemnify
Buyer pursuant to Article 7 of this Agreement. Only to the extent that Buyer
or its Affiliates are implicated in the proposed settlement of any Third
Party Claim subject to Seller control pursuant to this Section 7.04(a)(i),
shall Seller be subject to the Settlement Guidelines (as defined below) with
respect thereto. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) Buyer shall at all times control and appoint lead counsel for the defense
and/or settlement, in each case at its own expense, of Third Party Claims
related to (A) Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, to the extent solely
related to activity or obligations of the Business as conducted by Buyer or
its Affiliates after the Closing and (B) the Business, to the extent related
to periods and activity _both_ before _and_ after the Closing; _provided_
however, that the Parties hereby agree that clause (B) hereof shall _not_
include any Third Party Claim related to any Seller service or business not
exclusively related to the Business (in which case such claim shall be subject
to Section 7.04(a)(i) of this Agreement). Seller may participate, at its own
expense and to the extent applicable, in any such Third Party Claim to the
extent Seller or its Affiliates are joined as and remain a party to such
claim. Only to the extent that Seller or its Affiliates are implicated in
the proposed settlement of any Third Party Claim subject to Buyer control
pursuant to this Section 7.04(a)(ii), shall Buyer be subject to the
Settlement Guidelines (as defined below) with respect thereto. 

  

For purposes of this Section 7.04(a), "Settlement Guidelines" shall require
the Party controlling the settlement of any Third Party Claim pursuant to
this Section 7.04(a), prior to the entry thereof, to obtain the written
consent of the non-controlling Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) in connection with any settlement that (i) includes an
obligation to be performed by the non-controlling Party or its Affiliates
(including payment of Damages), an obligation to abstain from performing any
action by such non-controlling Party or its Affiliates, or the requirement to
opine as to the validity of any patents or (ii) relates to matters
pursuant to which such non-controlling Party may be subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement. 

  

(b) In addition to the notice provisions set forth in Section 7.03(a) of this
Agreement, if notice of any Third Party Claim is received by a Party not
otherwise entitled to control and/or participate in such claim pursuant to
Section 7.04(a) of this Agreement, the Party receiving such notice shall
promptly provide written notice and details thereof (which shall include
receipt or written notice of any applicable Claim, Proceeding or potential
Claim or Proceeding) to the applicable controlling and/or participating
Party. 

  

(c) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause their respective representatives,
employees, agents and Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution
of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished, subject
to Section 5.03(b) of this Agreement, such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. In
addition, the Party controlling the defense and/or settlement of any
applicable Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.04(a) of this Agreement
shall keep the other applicable parties thereto reasonably informed of the
progress of any defense, compromise or settlement with respect thereto. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the control or settlement of, or right
to control or settle, any claim pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall not alter
or amend the contractual rights to indemnification of the Parties otherwise
set forth in Article 7 of this Agreement and (ii) matters related to the
Traffic Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement shall be governed by
the indemnification and claim provisions thereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 7.05. _Calculation of Damages; Mitigation_. (a) The amount of any
Damages payable under Section 7.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of
(i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable
insurance policies with respect to such Damages in excess of the sum of (1)
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to collection under such
policies and (2) any deductible associated therewith to the extent paid and
(ii) any net Tax benefits actually realized within the two year
period following such Damages by the Indemnified Party (assuming a combined
federal and state corporate income Tax rate of 40 percent). If the
Indemnified Party actually recovers any amounts under applicable insurance
policies or actually realizes such a Tax benefit, subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made
or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing
such indemnification payment up to the amount actually received or realized
by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in collecting such amount. 

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for consequential, special,
indirect, exemplary or punitive Damages (other than with respect to any such
Damages payable to a third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim). 

  

(c) Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any
Damages for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its Damages after the
Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification
provision of this Agreement in respect of such Damages, the Indemnified Party
must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the
extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that
mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys reasonable costs of mitigation)
within two Business Days after the benefit is received. Each Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available
under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible,
for any Damages payable under Section 7.02. 

  

(d) For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages incurred in connection
with a Seller Warranty Breach or a Buyer Warranty Breach, but not for
determining whether a Seller Warranty Breach or a Buyer Warranty Breach has
occurred, all materiality qualifications (or similar or correlative terms)
shall be disregarded from applicable representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement. 

  

Section 7.06. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 7.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part
of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover
from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment; _provided_ that
the Indemnified Party shall not be required to assign any right to proceed
against a Potential Contributor if the Indemnified Party has a continuing
commercial relationship with the Potential Contributor or determines in its
reasonable discretion that such assignment would be materially detrimental to
its reputation or future business prospects. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 7.07. _Exclusive Remedy_. Absent (i) actual fraud involving a knowing
and intentional misrepresentation of a fact material to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement made with the intent of inducing any other
Party hereto to enter into this Agreement and upon which such other Party has
relied (as opposed to any fraud claim based on constructive knowledge,
negligent misrepresentation or a similar theory) under applicable tort laws
or (ii) a willful breach of the covenant set forth in Section 5.10(a), the
indemnification provisions contained in this Article 7 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy following the Closing as to all Damages any Indemnified
Party may incur arising from or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that nothing in this
Section 7.07 or elsewhere in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements shall
affect the Parties rights to specific performance or other equitable
remedies with respect to the covenants referred to in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements). 

  

Section 7.08. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnification payment received pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

Section 7.09. _Form of Payment of Damages_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay
any indemnifiable Damages required pursuant to this Article 7 in cash,
without any right of set-off against any amounts owed by any applicable
party pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Traffic
Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE 8 
 Termination 

   

Section 8.01. _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing: 

  

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; 

  

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on August 25, 2010 (the "Termination
Date");  _provided_ however, that (i) the failure to consummate the Closing
on or before the Termination Date did not result principally from the failure
of the Party seeking termination of this Agreement to fulfill any undertaking
or commitment on its part provided for herein prior to Closing and (ii) in
the sole discretion of Seller, in up to two successive elections and at
any time prior to the Closing Date, the Termination Date may be extended by
up to nine additional months after such date in connection with any
Proceeding of any Governmental Authority with respect to regulatory matters
pursuant to the HSR Act or other anti-trust related regulations or actions; 

  

(c) by Seller, if (i) there has been a breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any such representation or
warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that
the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b) would not be satisfied or (ii) the
covenants or obligations of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall have
been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) would not
be satisfied;  _provided_ however, that if such breach or failure to be true
is curable by Buyer during the 45 calendar day period after Seller notifies
Buyer in writing of the existence of such breach or 

  

    ##### 

  

   

failure to be true, then Seller may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.01(c) as a result of such breach or failure to be true prior to the
expiration of such period unless Buyer is no longer continuing to exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or failure to be true
(provided that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its
nature cannot be cured); 

  

(d) by Buyer, if (i) there has been a breach of any representation or warranty
of Seller contained in this Agreement or any such representation or warranty
shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.02(b) would not be satisfied or (ii) the
covenants or obligations of Seller contained in this Agreement shall
have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) would
not be satisfied;  _provided_ however, that if such breach or failure to be
true is curable by Seller during the 45 calendar day period after Buyer
notifies Seller in writing of the existence of such breach or failure to be
true, then Buyer may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(d)
as a result of such breach or failure to be true prior to the expiration of
such period unless Seller is no longer continuing to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach or failure to be true (provided that
no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot
be cured); 

  

(e) by either Seller or Buyer (i) if consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or
judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction or (ii)
if there shall be any action taken, or any Applicable Law enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby by any Governmental Authority, which would compel such Party to sell,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the Purchased
Assets or limit operation of the Business. 

  

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01
shall give written notice of such termination to the other Party. 

  

Section 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 8.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either Party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such Party) to the other Party to this
Agreement; _provided_  that if such termination shall result from the
knowing, willful and intentional (i) failure of either Party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of the obligations of the other Party,
(ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by
either Party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained
herein, such Party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by the other Party as a result of such failure or breach.
The provisions of Sections 5.05, 5.06, Article 7 and Article 9 shall survive
any termination hereof. 

  

Section 8.03. _Wrongful Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if a Party wrongfully terminates this Agreement, that
Party shall be liable for any Damages caused thereby.

action arising out of, based upon, or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by,
and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the

that would result in the application of any laws other than the laws of the
State of Delaware. 

  

Section 9.06. _Jurisdiction_. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out
of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought solely in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if

Delaware and any direct appellate court therefrom). Each Party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect
of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating
to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder and agrees
that it will not bring any action arising out of, based upon or related to

accordance with Section 9.01, (ii) any claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that notice or
the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of,

Section 9.07. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY

SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR

PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF. 

  

Section 9.08. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party hereto. Until and
unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party
hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). 

  

Section 9.09. _Entire Agreement; Mutual Drafting; Headings_. This Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Exclusivity Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Each Party has
participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties, and the language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their
mutual intent. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
then this Agreement will accordingly be construed as drafted jointly by the
Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party to this Agreement by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. The captions, headings and table
of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements. 

  

Section 9.10. _Bulk Sales Laws_. Buyer and Seller each hereby waive compliance

"bulk transfer" or similar laws of any state. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 9.11. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible. 

  

Section 9.12. _Specific Performance._ The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and that the Parties may
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, with all
such matters to take place exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware), and any such injunction shall be in addition to any other
remedy to which any Party is entitled, at law or in equity.
