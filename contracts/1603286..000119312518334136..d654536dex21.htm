(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Parent Group
Entities, taken as a whole (including the ownership of the DM Group
Entities); _provided, however,_ that any adverse changes, effects, events or
occurrences resulting from or due to any of the following shall be disregarded
in determining whether there has been a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (a)
changes, effects, events or occurrences affecting the natural gas gathering,
processing, treating, transportation and storage industries generally and NGL
marketing industry generally (including any change in the prices of natural
gas, NGL or other hydrocarbon products, industry margins or any regulatory
changes or changes in applicable Law), (b) changes, effects, events or
occurrences affecting the United States or global economic conditions
or financial, credit, debt, securities or other capital markets in general,
(c) any outbreak of, acts of or escalation of hostilities, terrorism, war or
other similar national emergency, (d) the announcement or pendency of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (e) changes in any Laws
applicable to Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or in accounting
regulations or principles or the interpretation thereof that materially affect
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (f) the Parent
Parties taking any action required or contemplated by this Agreement, (g)
changes, effects, events or occurrences at any DM Group Entity or (h) any
change in the market price or trading volume of the shares of common stock or
other equity securities of Parent (it being understood and agreed that the
foregoing shall not preclude any other party to this Agreement from asserting
that any facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such change
that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of Parent Material Adverse
Effect should be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining
whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect); _provided, however,_ that, in the case of clauses
(a), (b), (c) and (e) the adverse impact on the Parent Group Entities, taken
as a whole, is not materially disproportionate to the adverse impact
on similarly situated parties, or (ii) prevents or materially impedes,
interferes with or hinders the ability of either of the Parent Parties to
perform their obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any change, effect, event or occurrence (or the facts underlying such change,
effect, event or occurrence) of which either of the DM Parties has Knowledge
as of the date of this Agreement shall not constitute a Parent Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Parent Group Entities.

_ARTICLE II_

 

 _MERGER_

 

 _SECTION 2.1_ _Closing of the Merger_.

 

(a) _Closing Date_ _._ Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
(other than those conditions that are not legally permitted to be waived) to
closing set forth in Article VI, the closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.1 shall be held at the
offices of McGuireWoods LLP at Gateway Plaza, 800 East Canal Street,
Richmond, Virginia 23219-3916 on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver (other than those conditions that are not legally
permitted to be waived) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than conditions that would normally be satisfied on the Closing Date,
but subject to satisfaction or waiver (other than those conditions that are
not legally permitted to be waived) of those conditions) commencing at 9:00
a.m., local time, or such other place, date and time as may be mutually agreed
upon in writing by the parties hereto; _provided, however,_ that the Closing
shall not occur on or prior to the record date for the regular quarterly cash
distribution on the DM Common Units that is paid or payable during the
calendar quarter ending March 31, 2019 (" _DM Fourth Quarter Distribution_ ").
The " _Closing Date_ ," as referred to herein, shall mean the date on which
the Closing actually occurs.

(b) _Effective Time_ _._ Concurrently with or as soon as practicable
following the Closing, Parent and DM shall cause a certificate of merger
effecting the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, duly executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA, as applicable (the date and time

 



11

    

 of such filing (or, if agreed by the parties hereto, such later time and
date as may be expressed therein as the effective date and time of the Merger)
being the " _Effective Time_ "). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into
DM, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and DM shall continue as
the surviving limited partnership in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ").

(c) _Effect of the Merger on Equity Securities_ _._ Subject in each case to
Sections 2.1(e) and 2.1(f), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, DM, DM General Partner,
any Holder of DM Units, any Holder of Parent Common Stock, or any
other Person:

(i) _Conversion of DM Public Common Units_. Each of the DM Public Common Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive 0.2492 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Stock. In addition, if the
Effective Time occurs on or after the record date for the regular quarterly
cash dividend on the Parent Common Stock that is paid or payable during the
calendar quarter ending March 31, 2019 (the " _Parent First Quarter Dividend_
"), then each Holder of DM Public Common Units outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time also shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the Parent First Quarter Dividend to which such
Holder would have been entitled if (x) the Effective Time had occurred prior
to the record date for the Parent First Quarter Dividend and (y) on the record
date for the Parent First Quarter Dividend, such Holder was a Holder of the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock such Holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to the preceding sentence (in either case, such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the preceding sentence and such
amount of cash, if any, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) _Treatment of DM Public Series A Preferred Units_. Each of the DM Public
Series A Preferred Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, at the election of the holders of such units in accordance with the DM
Partnership Agreement, either (A) convert into DM Public Common Units (such
converted or redeemed units pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(A) or (C), the " _DM
Converted Units_ ") in accordance with Sections 5.11(b)(vii)(B)(1) or (2) of
the DM Partnership Agreement, (B) remain outstanding in accordance with
Section 5.11(b)(vii)(B)(3) of the DM Partnership Agreement, or (C) be
redeemed for cash or DM Public Common Units, in the sole discretion of DM, in
accordance with Section 5.11(b)(vii)(B)(4) of the DM Partnership Agreement.
Each Holder of DM Converted Units shall receive the Merger Consideration in
exchange for their DM Converted Units. All DM Series A Preferred Units that
remain outstanding at the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following
the Effective Time.

 

(iii) _Conversion and Cancellation of the DM Public Units._ Each DM Public
Unit, upon being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) or Section 2.1(c)(ii), as applicable, shall
cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each Holder of such DM Public Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter cease to be a limited partner of DM or have
any rights with respect to such DM Public Units, (A) except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and (B) the right to receive any dividends,
distributions and Fractional Share Payments to which former Holders of DM
Public Units become entitled, all in accordance with this Article II upon the
Surrender of uncertificated DM Public Units represented by book-entry form ("
_Book-Entry DM Public Units_ "), and receipt of such other documents in
accordance with Section 2.2.

 



12

    

(iv) _Treatment of DM-Owned Units, Parent-Owned Partnership Interests and
Non-Converting Series A Holders_. Any DM Units that are owned immediately
prior to the Effective Time by DM shall be automatically canceled and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
canceled DM Units. The (A) DM General Partner Interest, (B) DM Incentive
Distribution Rights, (C) DM Units that are not DM Public Units and are not
cancelled pursuant to the preceding sentence, and (D) DM Public Series A
Preferred Units held by Non-Converting Series A Holders shall, in each case,
remain outstanding as partnership interests in the Surviving Entity,
unaffected by the Merger.

(v) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The outstanding limited liability company interest
in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into an aggregate number of DM Common Units equal to the
number of DM Public Units that are converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) and Section 2.1(c)(ii),
and the holder of such DM Common Units shall be admitted as a limited partner
of DM. At the Effective Time, the books and records of DM shall be revised to
reflect the cancellation and retirement of all DM Public Units and the
conversion of the limited liability company interest in Merger Sub to DM
Common Units, the admission of the sole member of Merger Sub as a limited
partner of DM and the existence of DM (as the Surviving Entity)
shall continue without dissolution.

(d) _Other Effects of the Merger_ _._ The Merger shall be conducted in
accordance with and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA. At the Effective Time, (i) the
certificate of limited partnership of DM shall continue as the certificate of
limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, and (ii) the DM Partnership
Agreement shall remain unchanged and shall continue as the agreement of
limited partnership of the Surviving Entity.

 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_ _._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and (ii) each registered
Holder of DM Public Units exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all DM Public Units held by such Holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time) shall receive from Parent, in lieu of such
fractional share, an amount (a " _Fractional Share Payment_ ") in cash
(payable in dollars, without interest) equal to the product of (A) such
fraction, multiplied by (B) the average of the closing price of Parent Common
Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape (as reported by
Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree
in writing) over the five trading day period ending on the third trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. The parties acknowledge that payment
of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



13

    

(f) _Certain Adjustments_ _._ If between the Execution Date and the Effective
Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
number of outstanding DM Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be changed into a different number of units, shares or other securities
(including any different class or series of securities) by reason of any
dividend or distribution payable in partnership interests, voting securities,
equity interests or Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar
transaction, or any such transaction shall be authorized, declared or agreed
upon with a record date at or prior to the Effective Time, then the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such transaction and to provide to DM,
Merger Sub and the Holders of DM Restricted Unit Awards and DM Public Units
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be references to
the Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items, as
so adjusted; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this Section 2.1(f) shall
be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such dividend
or distribution payable in equity securities or Rights, subdivision,
reclassification, split, split-up, combination, merger, consolidation,
reorganization, exchange or other similar transaction, or the authorization,
declaration or agreement to do such transaction that it is not
otherwise authorized or permitted to be undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided, further_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that no
adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall be made relating to the merger
pursuant to the SCANA Merger Agreement. 

_SECTION 2.2_ _Exchange of DM Public Units_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
Equiniti Trust Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any Fractional Share Payment. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (A) deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of DM Public Units, an amount of cash
sufficient to effect the delivery of the estimated aggregate Fractional Share
Payment and, if the Effective Time occurs on or after the record date for the
Parent First Quarter Dividend, an amount of cash sufficient to effect the
payment of the Parent First Quarter Dividend to Holders of DM Public Units in
accordance with Section 2.1(c) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), (B) reserve with
the Exchange Agent the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
Section 2.1(c)(i) and Section 2.1(c)(ii), and (C) authorize the Exchange Agent
to exchange shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section
2.2. In addition, Parent shall deposit with the transfer agent an amount of
cash sufficient to effect the delivery of any declared but unpaid DM
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) in the ordinary course.
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent any additional cash or other
consideration as applicable in excess of the Exchange Fund as and when
necessary to pay any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(c), any Fractional Share Payment and other amounts required to be paid
under this Agreement. Parent shall pay all costs and fees of the Exchange
Agent and all expenses associated with the exchange process. Any shares of
Parent Common Stock, and any remaining amount of the Exchange Fund or other
funds deposited shall be returned to Parent after the earlier to occur of (x)
payment in full of all amounts due to the Holders of DM Public Units and (y)
the expiration of the period specified in Section 2.2(e).

 



14

    

(b) _Exchange Procedures_ _._ Each Holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
DM Public Units shall upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form (it being understood that the Holders of Book-Entry
DM Public Units shall be deemed to have Surrendered such DM Public Units upon
receipt by the Exchange Agent of such "agents message" or such other
evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, (A) a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to (1) any dividends and other distributions
such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c) plus (2) any
cash in lieu of any Fractional Share Payment such Holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e) plus (3) if the Effective Time occurs after
the record date for the Parent First Quarter Dividend, an amount of cash
sufficient to effect payment of the Parent First Quarter Dividend to Holders
of DM Common Units in accordance with Section 2.1(c), and (B) the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, in uncertificated book-entry form, such
Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

(c) _Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged DM Public Units_
_._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Holder of any Book-Entry DM Public Units not Surrendered
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect
thereof until the Surrender of such Book-Entry DM Public Units in accordance
with this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, Parent shall
pay, or cause the Exchange Agent to pay, to each Holder of Book-Entry DM
Public Units, without interest, (i) at the time of Surrender of such Book-
Entry DM Public Units, the amount of dividends or other distributions
previously paid with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to such Book-Entry DM Public Units that have a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
time of Surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends and distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to
such Surrender and a payment date subsequent to such Surrender.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in DM Public Units_ _._ All Merger
Consideration issued upon the Surrender for exchange of Book-Entry DM Public
Units in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any
Fractional Share Payment) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the DM Public Units heretofore
represented by such Book-Entry DM Public Units, subject, however, to Parents
obligation, notwithstanding the conversion of DM Public Units pursuant to this
Agreement, with respect to DM Public Units outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, to pay (or cause DM to pay) to the Holder of DM Public
Units as of the applicable record date any dividends and distributions with a
record date at or prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by DM or the DM General Partner with respect to such DM Common Units in
accordance with the terms of the DM Partnership Agreement on or prior to the
Effective Time and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 



15

    

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. __ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the Holders of the Book-Entry DM Public Units
for twelve months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any Holders of the Book-Entry DM Public Units who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to
Parent and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration, any Fractional Share Payment and any dividends and
distributions with respect to DM Common Units or shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such Holders may be entitled.

(f) _No Liability_. __ To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, DM, DM General Partner or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration, distribution or
Fractional Share Payment properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Book-Entry
DM Public Units shall not have been Surrendered immediately prior to such date
on which any Merger Consideration, any Fractional Share Payment or any
dividends and distributions with respect to DM Common Units or shares of
Parent Common Stock in respect of such Book-Entry DM Public Units would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such units,
cash or distributions in respect of such Book-Entry DM Public Units shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. __ Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication, such amounts, which may
include shares of Parent Common Stock, as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Entity by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

_SECTION_ _ 2.3_ _Treatment of DM Restricted Unit Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each DM Restricted Unit Award that is not vested
and does not vest in accordance with its terms (as set forth in an applicable
award agreement) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall cease to represent an award with respect to DM Common Units
and shall be converted into an award with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock (a " _Parent Award_ "), subject to the same vesting and forfeiture
provisions as were applicable under such DM Restricted Unit Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each such Parent Award to be equal to the number of DM Common Units
subject to each such DM Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (such product, rounded to the
nearest whole share), with any corresponding accrued but unpaid DERs (as
defined in the DM Long-Term Incentive Plan) with respect to any DM Restricted
Unit Awards to be assumed, remain outstanding and continue to represent an
obligation with respect to the applicable Parent Award.

 



16

    

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, DM and DM General Partner shall take all
action necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3. DM and DM
General Partner shall ensure that, as of immediately following the Effective
Time, no holder of a DM Restricted Unit Award or participant in the DM Long-
Term Incentive Plan shall have any rights thereunder to acquire, or other
rights in respect of, the equity of DM, the Surviving Entity or any of the DM
Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to the Parent Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by
this Section 2.3. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, to the extent legally required, file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other
appropriate forms, including Form S-3) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Parent Awards and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Awards
remain outstanding and the offering with respect thereto is required to be
registered.

(c) Each of the DM Group Entities is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and is in good standing in the states in which the character of the
properties and assets owned or held by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it requires it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a DM Material Adverse Effect.

(d) DM has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the Governing
Documents of each DM Party in effect as of the Execution Date. All such
Governing Documents are in full force and effect and no DM Party is in
violation of any provisions thereof.

 

 _SECTION 3.2_ _Authority and Approval_. Each of the DM Parties has all
requisite limited liability company or limited partnership power and
authority, as applicable, to execute and deliver this Agreement, and subject
to receipt of the DM Vote (as defined below), to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to perform all of the terms and conditions hereof to
be performed by it. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
the DM Parties, and subject to receipt of the DM Vote, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the performance of all of the terms and
conditions hereof to be performed by the DM Parties have been duly authorized

partnership interests in DM necessary to approve this Agreement and approve
and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the DM
Parties and, assuming the due execution and delivery by each of the other
parties hereto, constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each
of the DM Parties, enforceable against each of the DM Parties in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable

(b) As of the Execution Date, all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity or voting interests of each DM Subsidiary owned
directly or indirectly by the DM Parties (i) are owned, beneficially and of
record free and clear of all Liens and (ii) have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid (with respect to DM Subsidiaries that are limited
liability companies or limited partnerships, to the extent required under the
limited liability company agreement or limited partnership agreement of the
applicable DM Subsidiary) and, except for any general partner interest in a
DM Subsidiary, nonassessable (with respect to DM Subsidiaries that are limited

may be affected by Sections 18-607 and 18-804 of the DLLCA or by Sections
17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA and the Governing Documents of the
applicable entity).

_SECTION_ _ 3.5_ _SEC Documents; Internal Controls_.

(a) Since January 1, 2017, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K (whether filed on a voluntary basis or
otherwise), forms, schedules, certifications, prospectuses, registration
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by DM or any
DM Subsidiary with or to the SEC (the " _DM SEC Reports_ ") have been filed
or furnished. For a period of at least twelve calendar months immediately
prior to the Execution Date, all DM SEC Reports have been filed in a timely
manner. The DM SEC Reports shall not include any reports required to be filed
or furnished by any entity prior to such entity becoming a DM Subsidiary.
Each of the DM SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable Law (including the Exchange Act, the Securities Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ")), and (ii) as of its
effective date (in the case of DM SEC Reports that are registration statements
filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of its
filing date did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except for any statements (x) in any DM SEC
Report that may have been modified by an amendment to such report or a
subsequent report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date or (y) with
respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent, as to
which DM makes no representation or warranty.

 



20

    

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.5(b) of the DM Disclosure Letter, no DM
Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other documents with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding comments from, or
unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with respect to the DM SEC
Reports. No enforcement action has been initiated against DM relating to
disclosures contained or omitted from any DM SEC Report.

(c) DM makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and
maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, as required pursuant to
Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. DM has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by DM in the reports that it files under
the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to its management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. DM
General Partners principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to DMs
auditors and the audit committee of the DM Board (x) all significant
deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect DMs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for DMs auditors any material weakness in
internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in DMs internal
controls.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2017, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the DM General Partner have made all certifications
(without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to
Knowledge) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in
any such certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities
or its officers have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning
or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and except as
disclosed in a DM SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date,
none of such entities has any Knowledge of any material weaknesses in the
design or operation of such internal controls over financial reporting.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 3.6_ _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been

related thereto.

_SECTION_ __ _ 4.4_ _Capitalization_.

Parent Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. Except as set forth in the

other voting securities of Parent other than pursuant to the exercise or
vesting of equity awards under any Parent equity award plans or pursuant to
Parents dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (" _Dominion
Energy Direct_ "), in each case, outstanding as of November 23, 2018 and (y)
except as set forth on Section 4.4(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, there
have been no issuances by Parent of options, warrants, other rights to
acquire shares of capital stock of Parent or other rights that give the holder
thereof any economic interest of a nature accruing to the Holders of Parent
Common Stock. All outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are, and all
such shares of Parent Common Stock that may be issued prior to the Effective
Time will be when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and not subject to preemptive rights.

 

(b) As of the Execution Date, all of the outstanding capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests of each Parent Subsidiary owned directly
or indirectly by the Parent Parties (i) are owned, beneficially and of record
free and clear of all Liens and (ii) have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully paid (with respect to Parent Subsidiaries that are
limited liability companies or limited partnerships, to the extent required
under the limited liability company agreement or limited partnership agreement
of the applicable Parent Subsidiary) and nonassessable (with respect to Parent
Subsidiaries that are limited liability companies or limited partnerships,
except as such nonassessability may be affected by Sections 18-607 and 18-804
of the DLLCA or by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA and the
Governing Documents of the applicable entity).

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 4.5_ _SEC Documents; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2017, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K (whether filed on a voluntary basis or
otherwise), forms, schedules, certifications, prospectuses, registration
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary with or to the SEC (the " _Parent SEC Reports_ ") have
been timely filed or furnished. For a period of at least twelve calendar
months immediately prior to the Execution Date, all Parent SEC Reports have
been filed in a timely manner. The Parent SEC Reports shall not include any
reports required to be filed or furnished by any entity prior to such entity
becoming a Parent Subsidiary. Each of the Parent SEC Reports (i) complied in
all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law (including the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and (ii) as of
its effective date (in the case of Parent SEC Reports that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the Securities Act) and as of its filing date did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except for any statements (x) in any Parent SEC Report
that may have been modified by an amendment to such report or a subsequent
report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date or (y) with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of DM, as to which Parent
makes no representation or warranty.

 



27

    

(b) There are no outstanding comments from, or unresolved issues raised by,
the staff of the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Reports. No enforcement
action has been initiated against Parent relating to disclosures contained or
omitted from any Parent SEC Report.

 

(c) Parent makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and
maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, as required pursuant
to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the
NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Parents principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(x) all significant deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls.

(d) Since January 1, 2017, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of Parent have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to Knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of Parent or its officers
have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging
the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of
such certification. As of the Execution Date, and except as disclosed in a
Parent SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date, Parent has
no Knowledge of any material weaknesses in the design or operation of such
internal controls over financial reporting.

_SECTION_ __ _ 4.6_ _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") as of their respective
dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment) comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent as of such dates and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of Parent for such periods, except as otherwise noted therein. Except as
set forth in the Parent Financial Statements, there are no off-balance sheet
arrangements that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has not had any disagreement with its
independent public accounting firm that required disclosure in the Parent SEC
Reports.

 



28

Subsidiaries (whether known or unknown and whether accrued, absolute,

assets, or any of the operations of the Parent Group Entities related thereto
or (ii) Orders against or affecting the Parent Group Entities, their assets,
or any of the operations of the Parent Group Entities related thereto.

(b) None of the Parent Group Entities (i) is in violation of or in default
under its Governing Documents or (ii) is in violation of any applicable Law,
except in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii) for such violations or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 4.8_ _No Adverse Changes_. Except as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Reports or described in the Parent Financial Statements, as applicable,
with respect to the Parent Group Entities:

(a) since December 31, 2017, there has not been a Parent Material Adverse
Effect;

Tax assessment, deficiency or adjustment has been asserted or proposed with
respect to Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or their assets, and (e)
Parent has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code in the two years prior to the
date of this Agreement or in a distribution which could otherwise constitute
part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Party Group reasonable access, during normal business hours from the Execution
Date until the Closing Date, to its properties, books, contracts and records

Group for personal injuries sustained by the requesting Party Groups
officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other representatives and
advisors in connection with the access provided pursuant to this Section 5.2,
and shall be indemnified and held harmless by the requesting Party Group for

33

    

_SECTION_ __ _ 5.3_ _Certain Filings_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Execution Date (i) Parent and DM
shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC, and each of the DM Parties and
the Parent Parties agrees to cooperate in the preparation of, the Registration
Statement (including the consent statement/prospectus constituting a part
thereof (the " _Consent Statement/Prospectus_ ")) and any other documents
required under Section 2.3(c) and Parent shall file with the SEC the Consent
Statement/Prospectus and any other required documents required under Section
2.3(c), (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing
on the NYSE (subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) the parties hereto shall make all required filings
under applicable state securities and "blue sky" Laws; _provided, however,_
that no such filings shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result
thereof, Parent would become subject to general service of process or to
taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation doing
business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such filing. Each of
Parent and DM agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after filing thereof and keep the Registration
Statement effective until the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms. DM shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Consent
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the holders of DM Public Units as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and DM agrees to furnish to the
other party all information concerning the Parent Group Entities or the DM
Group Entities, as applicable, and to take such other action as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Consent
Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or DM, in each case without
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, the Consent Statement/Prospectus shall
not be required to include a recommendation by the DM Board or the DM
Conflicts Committee to the Holders of DM Public Units regarding the Agreement.

 

(b) Each of the Parent Parties and the DM Parties agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and (ii) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Consent
Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date
the Consent Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the Holders of DM Public Units,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Parent
Parties and the DM Parties further agrees that, if it shall become
aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any of
the statements in the Registration Statement or the Consent
Statement/Prospectus to be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false
or misleading, it will promptly inform the other party thereof and take the
necessary steps to correct such information in an amendment or supplement to
the Registration Statement or Consent Statement/Prospectus.

 



34

    

(c) Each of DM and Parent shall (1) promptly notify the other of receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government
official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other applicable
government official for amendments or supplements to any of the filings with
the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby or for additional information and (2) promptly supply the other with
copies of all correspondence between DM or any of its representatives, or
Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government official, on the
other hand, with respect thereto. Parent and DM shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Consent Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement
as promptly as practicable.

(d) DM General Partner shall distribute to the Holders of DM Public Units the
Consent Statement/Prospectus, which shall include a form of consent that may
be executed by Holders of DM Public Units in connection with the Written
Consent as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act.

_SECTION_ __ _ 5.4_ _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances_. From and
after the Execution Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take,

all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, (ii) defend any lawsuits or other Proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seek to have lifted or
rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (iii) obtain promptly all
approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Entity or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
foregoing but subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree that, from time to time, whether before, at or after the Closing
Date, each of them will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, such instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance,
endorsement, direction or authorization as may be necessary to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will require any
party hereto to hold separate or make any divestiture not expressly
contemplated herein of any asset or otherwise agree to any restriction on its
operations or other condition in order to obtain any consent or approval or
other clearance required by this Agreement.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.5_ _No Public Announcement_. On the Execution Date, Parent
and DM shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of
this Agreement and the Merger, which press release shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and DM General Partner. From and after the Execution
Date, neither DM nor Parent shall issue any other press release or make any
other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (to

 



35

    

 the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement)
(other than public announcements at industry road shows and conferences or as
may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with the NYSE, in which event the party making the public
announcement or press release shall, to the extent practicable, notify Parent
and DM General Partner in advance of such public announcement or press
release) without the prior approval of Parent and DM General Partner, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.6_ _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, including legal fees, accounting fees,
financial advisory fees and other professional and non-professional fees and
expenses, shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such expenses, except
that Parent and DM shall each pay for one-half of (a) any filing fees with
respect to the Registration Statement and the Consent Statement/Prospectus
and (b) the costs of printing and mailing of the Consent Statement/Prospectus.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.7_ _Regulatory Issues_. DM and Parent shall cooperate fully
with respect to any filing, submission or communication with a Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction over the Merger. Such cooperation shall include
each of the parties hereto: (i) providing, in the case of oral communications
with a Governmental Entity, advance notice of any such communication and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, an opportunity for the other party to
participate; (ii) providing, in the case of written communications, an
opportunity for the other party to comment on any such communication
and provide the other with a final copy of all such communications; and (iii)

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.8_ _Tax Matters_. For United States federal income tax
purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign tax that
follows the United States federal income tax treatment), the parties have
agreed to treat the Merger as a taxable sale of the DM Public Units by the
holders of such DM Public Units in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The
parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing
and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the
course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law following a final
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other administrative
settlement with or final administrative decision by the relevant Governmental
Entity.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.9_ _D andO Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Laws, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, and
shall cause the DM Group Entities to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each DM
DandO Indemnified Party against any reasonable costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses
and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or

 



36

    

 participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Proceeding arising from acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including any Proceeding
relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a DM DandO
Indemnified Party), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding arising from
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and, upon receipt by Parent of
an undertaking by or on behalf of the DM DandO Indemnified Party to repay such
amount if it shall be determined in a final and non-appealable judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction that the DM DandO Indemnified Party
is not entitled to be indemnified, provide advancement of expenses
with respect to each of the foregoing to, all DM DandO Indemnified Parties and
(ii) honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination
of liability and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) now existing in favor of the DM DandO Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Governing Documents of any DM Group Entity, under applicable
Delaware Law or otherwise, and shall ensure that the Governing Documents of
DM and DM General Partner (or their successor entities) shall, for a period of
six years following the Effective Time, contain provisions substantially no
less advantageous with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
elimination of liability and exculpation of their present and former
directors, officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the Governing
Documents of DM and DM General Partner as of the Execution Date. Any right of
a DM DandO Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) shall not be
amended, repealed, terminated or otherwise modified at any time in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights of such DM DandO Indemnified Party as
provided herein, and shall be enforceable by such DM DandO Indemnified Party and
their respective heirs and representatives against Parent and its respective
successors and assigns.

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
officers and directors liability insurance with a nationally reputable
carrier covering each DM DandO Indemnified Party who is or at any time prior to
the Effective Time was covered by the existing officers and directors
liability insurance applicable to the DM Group Entities (" _D andO
Insurance_"), on terms substantially no less advantageous to the DM DandO
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, than such existing insurance with respect
to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, at or prior to the
Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other Proceedings relating thereto
are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time);
_provided, however,_ that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance for the DM DandO Indemnified Parties in excess of
300% of the current annual premium currently paid by the DM Group Entities for
such insurance, but shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for
such applicable amount. Parent shall have the right to cause such coverage to
be extended under the applicable DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail"
policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the DM DandO Indemnified
Parties than the existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy
the provisions of this Section 5.9.

 



37

    

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement for a period
of six years and expressly are intended to benefit each of the DM DandO
Indemnified Parties; _provided, however,_ that in the event that any claim or
claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this Section 5.9 are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of all such claims. The rights of any DM DandO Indemnified Party
under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any other rights such DM DandO
Indemnified Party may have under the Governing Documents of any DM Group
Entity or applicable Law.

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that its
successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9.

 

 _SECTION_ __ _ 5.10_ _Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing
Cooperation_. The DM Parties hereby consent to the Parent Group Entities use
of and reliance on any audited or unaudited financial statements, including
the DM Financial Statements, relating to the DM Group Entities reasonably
requested by the Parent Parties to be used in any financing or other
activities of the Parent Parties permitted hereby, including any filings that
the Parent Parties desire to make with the SEC. In addition, the DM Parties
will use reasonable best efforts, at the Parent Parties sole cost and
expense, to obtain the consents of Deloitte and Touche LLP to the inclusion of
the financial statements referenced above in appropriate filings with the SEC.
Prior to the Closing, the DM Parties will provide the Parent Parties such
information, and make available such personnel, as the Parent Parties may
reasonably request in order to assist any of the Parent Group Entities in
connection with financing activities permitted hereby, including any public
offerings to be registered under the Securities Act or private offerings.

_SECTION_ __ _ 5.11_ _Distributions_. After the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, the DM General Partner shall (and Parent shall directly
or indirectly cause its representatives on the DM Board to) determine, declare
and cause DM to pay regular quarterly cash distributions on the DM Common
Units for each quarter in accordance with the DM Partnership Agreement in the
ordinary course and consistent with past practice, including with respect to
amount and timing of record dates and payment dates; _provided, however,_
that, subject to applicable Law, any such regular quarterly distribution
shall not be less than or exceed the amounts set forth on Section 5.11 of the
DM Disclosure Letter without the separate determination and approval of the DM
Conflicts Committee made in accordance with the DM Partnership Agreement and
their duties as directors of the DM Board. The DM General Partner shall (and
Parent shall directly or indirectly cause its representatives on the DM Board
to) designate the record and payment dates for the DM Fourth
Quarter Distribution so that such record and payment dates precede the
Effective Time so as to permit the payment, not later than immediately prior
to the Effective Time, of the DM Fourth Quarter Distribution to the Holders of
DM Public Units on such record date.

_SECTION_ __ _ 5.12_ _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the DM Board and the Parent Board shall take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispositions of DM Units (including derivative
securities with respect to such DM Units) or acquisitions of shares of Parent
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such shares
Parent Common Stock) resulting from

 



38

    

 the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to DM, or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

 _SECTION 5.13_ _Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the Effective Time, none of
the DM Group Entities shall, without the consent of the DM Conflicts
Committee, eliminate the DM Conflicts Committee, or revoke or diminish the
authority of the DM Conflicts Committee, or remove or cause the removal of any
director of the DM Board that is a member of the DM Conflicts Committee
either as a member of such board or such committee without the affirmative
vote of the members of the DM Board, including the affirmative vote of each of
the other members of the DM Conflicts Committee. For the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 5.13 shall not apply to the filling in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Governing Documents of any vacancies caused by
the death, incapacity or resignation of any director.

 

 _SECTION 5.14_ _Takeover Laws_. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or related thereto. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger, the Parent Stock Issuance or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or related thereto, Parent and the Parent
Board shall grant such approvals and shall use reasonable best efforts to take
such actions so that the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance, may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise use reasonable best
efforts to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Parent
Stock Issuance.

 _SECTION 7.1_ _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be

or failed to perform any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the

Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (i) would (if it
occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) (with or without the passage of time)
and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Parent Parties
prior to the Termination Date; _provided, however,_ that the right to

to the Termination Date; _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate this

provisions of Section 5.5, Section 5.6, Article VII and Article VIII shall
survive such termination; except that nothing herein shall relieve any party
hereto from any liability for any intentional or willful and material breach
by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies of

agreements, covenants or obligations in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Effective Time.

_SECTION 7.8_ _Enforcement of this Agreement_. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach
of this Agreement by any party and any such breach would cause the non-
breaching parties irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that
prior to the termination of this Agreement, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the parties will
also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security,
to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance,

and not exclusive of, any other liability that such party may have at law or
in equity based on such partys (a) fraudulent acts or omissions or (b)
willful misconduct. None of the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be a waiver by or release of any party of any right or remedy
that such party may have at law or equity based on any other partys
fraudulent acts or omissions or willful misconduct nor shall any such
provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (i) the amounts of recovery sought or
awarded in any such claim for fraud or willful misconduct, (ii) the time
period during which a claim for fraud or willful misconduct may be brought,
or (iii) the recourse that any such party may seek against another party with

Agreement, and (d) agrees to service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice
in accordance with Section 8.1 or in any manner prescribed by the Laws of the

party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be (a)
consented to or waived in writing by the party benefited by the provision or
(b) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing by the parties
hereto; _provided, however,_ that, in addition to any other approvals required
by the DM Parties constituent documents or under this Agreement, the
foregoing consents, waivers, amendments or modifications in clauses (a) and
(b), and any decision or determination by DM to (x) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 or (y) enforce this Agreement
(including pursuant to Section 7.8), must be approved by, in the case of
consents, waivers, amendments or modifications, or such decisions or
determinations, by any DM Party, by the DM Board, and the DM Conflicts
Committee. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. The failure
of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or constitute
a waiver of such right or remedy in the future. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of
any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

_SECTION 8.4_ _Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; and
Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors
and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder, except (i) as
provided in Section 5.9, (ii) for the right of the Holders of DM Units to
receive the Merger Consideration, any Fractional Share Payment and any
distributions or dividends payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section
2.2(d) after the Closing (a claim by the Holders of DM Units with respect to
which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have occurred) and
(iii) for the right of the Holders of DM Restricted Unit Awards to receive
Parent Awards pursuant to Section 2.3 after the Closing (a claim by the
Holders of DM Restricted Unit Awards with respect to which may not be made
unless and until the Closing shall have occurred). No party hereto may assign,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation
of law or otherwise). Any attempted assignment, transfer, disposition or
alienation in violation of this Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective.

 

 _SECTION 8.5_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions or provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not affected in any matter materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
