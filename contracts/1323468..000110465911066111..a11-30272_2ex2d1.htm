 **ARTICLE II 
CONTRIBUTION OF ALLIANCE ENERGY LLC**

 



 

2.1 _Contribution of Alliance_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, at the Closing AEHC shall contribute and transfer to Global,
and Global agrees to accept from AEHC, the Alliance Equity Interests, free and
clear of all Encumbrances.

 



 

2.2 _Consideration_.

 



 

(a) In consideration of the contribution of Alliance to Global, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Global will (a) issue to AEHC
5,850,000 Common Units (the " _Units Consideration_ "), and (b) pay AEHC an
amount equal to the Cash Adjustment, if any, due by Global pursuant to Section
2.3 (the Units Consideration and the Cash Adjustment are collectively the "
_Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) The Units Consideration shall be issued by Global at the Closing by
delivery of a letter to Globalยs transfer agent (the " _Instruction Letter_ ")
instructing such transfer agent to deliver certificates representing the Units
Consideration issued in the name of AEHC or its designees (the "
_Certificates_ "), which Instruction Letter shall be in a form and substance
reasonably acceptable to both Parties.

 



 

2.3 _Determination of the Cash Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, Global shall complete a financial review and
reconciliation of the books and records of Alliance to determine the amount of
the Cash Adjustment in accordance with the terms of _Exhibit A_. Globalยs
general partner shall request Ernst and Young LLP (" _E andY_"), or another firm
of similar reputation, to review the calculation of the Cash Adjustment amount
as determined by Global and to execute specific "agreed upon

 



       
 

 



 

procedures" as determined by Global and defined in an engagement letter to be
executed prior to the commencement of such "agreed upon procedures." Upon the
completion of the "agreed upon procedures", EandY (or such other firm) will
prepare a report (the " _Agreed Upon Procedures Report_ ") summarizing the
results of its procedures and findings, if any. Within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Global will deliver to AEHC a statement setting forth
Globalยs calculation of the Cash Adjustment as of the Closing, calculated in
accordance with _Exhibit A_ and GAAP consistent with past practice of Alliance
(the " _Proposed Cash Adjustment_ "), together with a copy of the Agreed Upon
Procedures Report.

 



 

(b) After receipt of the determination of Proposed Cash Adjustment, AEHC and
its representatives shall have forty-five (45) days (the " _Review Period_ ")
to review such determination. During the Review Period, AEHC and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to the books and records of
Alliance and work papers prepared by Global relating to the Proposed Cash
Adjustment and to such historical financial information (to the extent in
Globalยs possession) relating to the Proposed Cash Adjustment as AEHC or its
representatives may reasonably request, provided, that such access shall be
during normal business hours and shall not interfere with the normal business
operations of Global or Alliance.

 



 

(c) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, AEHC may deliver to
Global a written statement setting forth any of AEHCยs objections to Globalยs
determination of the Proposed Cash Adjustment in reasonable detail, indicating
each disputed item and the basis for AEHCยs disagreement (the " _Statement of
Objections_ "). If AEHC fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before
the expiration of the Review Period or otherwise agrees in writing to the
determination of the Proposed Cash Adjustment, then Globalยs determination of
the Proposed Cash Adjustment shall be deemed to have been accepted by AEHC as
the final Cash Adjustment. If AEHC delivers the Statement of Objections
before the expiration of the Review Period, Global and AEHC shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such objections within thirty (30) days after that
delivery (the " _Resolution Period_ "). If the objections in the Statement of
Objections are resolved by the Parties at any time, the agreed Proposed Cash
Adjustment shall be final and binding on the Parties as the final Cash
Adjustment.

 



 

(d) If AEHC and Global fail to agree with respect to any of the matters set
forth in the Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution
Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ ") shall
be submitted for resolution to an impartial nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants as mutually agreed by AEHC and Global
and that has not been engaged by Global, AEHC or Alliance as its primary audit
firm during the two year period preceding such selection (the " _Independent
Accountants_ "). Within ten (10) Business Days after the designation of the
Independent Accountants, each of Global and AEHC shall submit a written
proposal to the Independent Accountants identifying its proposed resolution of
the Disputed Amounts. The Independent Accountants shall resolve the Disputed
Amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of such written proposals by
notifying the Parties in writing which Partyยs written proposal of resolution
the Independent Accountants have chosen as the prevailing proposal. The
Independent Accountantsย determination of the prevailing proposal shall be
made (i) in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review) and (ii) only with
respect to the Disputed Amounts specifically set forth in the Partiesย

 



      
 

 



 

submission to the Independent Accountants. The fees and expenses of the
accounting firm shall be paid by the non-prevailing Party.

 



 

(e) The Cash Adjustment as established pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be
the final Cash Adjustment hereunder and shall be binding on the Parties.

 



 

2.4 _Holdback_.

 



 

(a) Immediately upon the delivery of the Units Consideration to AEHC at the
Closing, AEHC will re-deliver to Global a portion of the Units Consideration
equal to 500,000 Common Units (the " _Collateral Amount_ "), which the general
partner of Global will hold as collateral to secure AEHCยs payment of the Cash
Adjustment to Global (if applicable). AEHC hereby grants to Global a first
priority security interest in and to the Common Units constituting the
Collateral Amount to secure its obligation thereunder to pay the Cash
Adjustment to Global and, upon the reasonable request of Global, AEHC shall
execute and deliver such other instruments as are required by Global to
evidence such security interest.

 



 

(b) Until the Collateral Amount is released to AEHC pursuant to Section
2.4(c), all distributions by Global in respect of the Common Units comprising
the Collateral Amount will be held by Global as part of the collateral pledged
to Global.

 



 

(c) Within ten (10) days following the final determination of the amount of
the Cash Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3: (i) AEHC shall pay to Global the
amount equal to the Cash Adjustment (if negative), or (ii) if the amount equal
to the Cash Adjustment is positive, Global will pay to AEHC the amount equal
to the Cash Adjustment (in absolute value). Upon Globalยs receipt of such
amount in immediately available funds if applicable under clause (i), or on
the date Globalยs payment to AEHC is due under clause (ii), as the case may
be, Global will release its security interest in the Collateral Amount
(together with any distributions retained by Global on such amount) and will
deliver to AEHC the Common Units comprising the Collateral Amount and the
distributions related thereto.

 



 

2.5 _Allocation of the Cash Adjustment_. The Parties agree that to the extent
Global pays an amount equal to the Cash Adjustment to AEHC, the Transaction
will, in part, be treated for federal income Tax purposes as a sale of assets
by AEHC to Global, subject to any exceptions to sale treatment available under
Section 707 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
If necessary, Global shall prepare an allocation of the Cash Adjustment from
Global to AEHC among the assets of Alliance and the Alliance Subsidiaries in a
manner that complies with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.5, the " _Allocation_ "). Global shall provide such Allocation to
AEHC within sixty (60) days from the Closing Date, and AEHC shall have fifteen
(15) days after receipt thereof to provide Global with any written objection
thereto. If AEHC objects to the Allocation, then the Parties agree to meet and
resolve the dispute in good faith. If the Parties fail to reach an agreement
on the Allocation, the Allocation shall be determined in accordance with the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 2.3(d). The cost of such
independent accountants shall be divided equally between AEHC and Global. AEHC
and Global shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Allocation
in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustments
to the amount of the

 



      
 

 



 

Cash Adjustment pursuant to this Agreement. AEHC and Global shall report
consistently with the Allocation in all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594,
which AEHC and Global shall timely file with the IRS, and neither AEHC nor
Global shall take any position in any return that is inconsistent with the
Allocation, as adjusted, in each case, unless otherwise required to do so by
applicable Law or a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code. Each of AEHC and Global agree to promptly advise each other regarding
the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to the
Allocation.

withheld, conditioned or delayed, AEHC will:

 



 

(i) Conduct the Alliance Businesses in the ordinary and usual course of day-
to-day operations, substantially consistent in nature, scope and magnitude
with the past practices of the Alliance Businesses, and to the extent so
consistent, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Allianceยs
business organization, and to maintain its existing relations and goodwill
with customers, suppliers, creditors, employees, lessors and agents;

 



 

(ii) Not increase the compensation, bonus, commissions or fee arrangements

or existing Reimbursement Agreement involving an investment by Alliance in
excess of $100,000;

 



 

(v) Not incur any additional Indebtedness or accrue any additional liabilities
other than (x) trade indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business

(xii) Not agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.1 or elsewhere in
this Agreement, Alliance shall be entitled to make a cash distribution or
distributions to AEHC during the period from the date hereof to the Closing
Date; provided, that (A) the total amount calculated pursuant to clauses (1)
through (9) of Exhibit A is not a negative number greater than $1,000,000
before such distribution, and (B) such distribution is not expected, based
upon then reasonable estimates by Alliance, to cause the amount so calculated
to become a negative number greater than $1,000,000.

 



 

7.2 _Compliance with Connecticut Bona Fide Offer Statute_. Prior to the
Closing, AEHC will, to the extent required by applicable Law, comply with the
Connecticut Bona Fide Offer Statute. AEHC will keep Global informed on a
timely basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its compliance with
such statute and shall provide to Global, upon its request, copies of any
materials or correspondence related thereto, including notice of the terms of
any offers proposed to be made to dealers pursuant to the requirements of that
statute. Global agrees to cooperate with AEHC in connection with AEHCยs
compliance with the Connecticut Bona Fide Offer Statute. Any costs related to
the compliance with such statute (including any attorneysย fees) incurred
prior to the Closing shall be borne as follows: 60% by AEHC and 40% by Global;
except that if the Transaction is not consummated, then Global will bear 100%
of such compliance costs and, if applicable, reimburse AEHC for any of such
compliance costs incurred by AEHC.

 



 

7.3 _Certain Receivables_. Allianceยs existing account receivable as of the
date hereof from the State of Connecticut, if collected subsequent to the
Closing, will be applied first to reimburse Alliance (as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Global) for any reasonable expenses (including attorneysย fees)
that it incurred post-Closing in connection with the payment or collection of
any of the Connecticut Receivable, and second, shared between AEHC and
Alliance with 75% to AEHC and 25% to Alliance at the time of such collection.

 



 

7.4 _Certain Governmental Matters_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 7.4, AEHC and Global agree to take or cause to be taken the following
actions: (i) provide promptly to any Governmental Authority with regulatory
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Competition Laws ("
_Governmental Competition Authority_ ") information and documents requested by
such Governmental Competition Authority, or necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with the Transaction; and (ii) without in any way limiting the
other provisions of this Section 7.4, file any notification and report form
pursuant to the HSR Act and related material required under any Competition
Law, in connection with the Transaction as soon

 



      
 

 



 

as practicable, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to
comply as soon as practicable with any requests for additional information or
documentary material that may be made under such Competition Law. From and
after the date hereof and until all governmental approvals required in
connection with the Transaction have been obtained, Global shall not, and
shall cause its direct and indirect subsidiaries not to, operate its business
in such manner or take any action, that could reasonably be expected to
significantly increase the risk of not obtaining any such governmental
approval or clearance or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period.

 



 

(b) Each of AEHC and Global shall (i) keep each other apprised of the status
of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Competition Authority, and shall comply
with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable. AEHC and Global
shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of
all filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this
Section 7.4, including, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, by permitting counsel for the other Party to review in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with,
any proposed written communication to any Governmental Competition Authority
and provide counsel for the other Party with copies of all filings and
submissions made by such Party and all correspondence and other written
communications between such Party (and its advisors) and any Governmental
Competition Authority and any other information supplied by such Party and
AEHC, Alliance or Global, as the case may be, to a Governmental Competition
Authority or received from such a Governmental Competition Authority in
connection with the Transaction; provided, however, that materials may be
redacted before being provided to the other Party (x) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Alliance Equity Interests and the Alliance
Businesses, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and
(ii) furnish to the other Party such information and assistance as the other
Party reasonably may request in connection with the preparation of any
submissions to, or agency proceedings by, any Governmental Competition
Authority. Upon and subject to the terms of this Section 7.4, each Party
agrees to cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist in
any defense by any other Party to the Transaction before any Governmental
Competition Authority reviewing the Transaction, including by providing as
promptly as practicable such information as may be requested by such
Governmental Competition Authority or such assistance as may be reasonably
requested by the other Party in such defense. Global shall be responsible for
paying any filing fees due in connection with any filings under this Section
7.4 and for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by either Global or AEHC in
responding to any inquiries or requests for additional information from any
Governmental Competition Authority under this Section 7.4.

 



 

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Competition Authority
with respect to the Transaction under any applicable Competition Law or which
would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transaction, or if any action is instituted by any
Governmental Competition Authority or any private party challenging any of the
Transaction as violative of applicable Competition Law, or an order is issued
enjoining the Contemplated Transactions, each of AEHC and Global shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as
to permit consummation of the Transaction by the Closing, including in order
to resolve such objections or suits which, in any

 



       
 

 



 

case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transaction. In the event
that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Competition Authority or
private party challenging the Transaction, each of AEHC and Global shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding, including defending through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court by any Person, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transaction.

 



 

(d) Each of AEHC and Global shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the applicable Competition Law as soon as practicable. AEHC and Global shall
not extend, directly or indirectly, any such waiting period or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Competition Authority to delay or not to
consummate the Transaction on the Closing Date, except with the prior written
consent of the other Party or unless otherwise required by Law. AEHC and
Global shall not have any substantive contact with any Governmental
Competition Authority in respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by
this Section 7.4 unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Competition Authority, gives the
other Party the opportunity to participate.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Global shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take any action reasonable
and necessary to avoid and eliminate each and every impediment under any
applicable United States Competition Law if required by a Governmental
Authority in the United States, so as to enable the consummation of the
Transaction as soon as reasonably possible, including, (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, mitigation agreement or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of the respective businesses, product lines or assets of Global and (ii)
otherwise using commercially reasonable efforts to take or commit to take
actions that after consummation of the Transaction would limit Globalยs
freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, any of
the businesses, product lines or assets of Global, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding brought under the Competition Law in the United States, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall Global be required to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or
otherwise take or commit to take any actions that limit its or their freedom
of action with respect to, or Globalยs ability to retain, any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Global if required by a Governmental
Authority in the United States, provided that any such action is conditioned
upon the consummation of the Transaction.

 



 

7.5 _Efforts of the Parties_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
herein provided, each of the Parties agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done by the Closing Date, all things necessary under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Transaction, including (i) to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on it with respect
to this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

and the Transaction (which actions shall include, furnishing all information
required by applicable Law in connection with approvals of, clearances or
consents from or filings with any Governmental Authority), (ii) to obtain any
consent, authorization (including any Governmental Authorization and related
bond, letter of credit or other financial assurance), Order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Authority or other public or private third
party required to be obtained by Global or AEHC in connection with the
acquisition of the Alliance Equity Interests or the taking of any related
action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) to effect all necessary
registrations and filings with Governmental Authorities.

 



 

7.6 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 



 

(i) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. AEHC shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns of Alliance and the Alliance Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Date
Tax Periods (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ ") that are required to be filed
on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns. AEHC shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Pre-Closing
Tax Returns of Alliance and the Alliance Subsidiaries that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date. All Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required
by applicable Law. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required to be filed after the Closing
Date, AEHC shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all
supporting documentation and workpapers, to Global for its review and
reasonable comment. Global will cause such Tax Return (as revised to
incorporate Globalยs reasonable comments) to be timely filed and will provide
a copy to AEHC. Not later than five days prior to the due date for payment of
Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Return, AEHC shall pay to Global the
amount of any AEHC Taxes with respect to such Tax Return.

 



 

(ii) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Global shall prepare or cause to be
prepared all Tax Returns of Alliance and the Alliance Subsidiaries for all
Straddle Tax Periods (" _Straddle Tax Returns_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to
the due date for filing any such Tax Return, Global shall deliver a copy of
such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to
AEHC for its review and reasonable comment. Global will cause such Tax Return
(as revised to incorporate AEHCยs reasonable comments) to be timely filed and
will provide a copy to AEHC. Not later than five days prior to the due date
for payment of Taxes with respect to any Straddle Tax Return, AEHC shall pay
to Global the amount of any AEHC Taxes with respect to such Tax Return.

 



 

(iii) _Proration of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to any Straddle Tax Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date
shall be:

 



 

(A) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that

 



      
 

 



 

would be payable if the Tax period of Alliance and the Alliance Subsidiaries
ended with (and included) the Closing Date;

 



 

(B) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of Alliance and the Alliance Subsidiaries, deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Tax Period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period; and

 



 

(C) for the avoidance of doubt, any margin or franchise Tax paid or payable
with respect to Alliance or the Alliance Subsidiaries shall be allocated to
the taxable period during which the income, receipts, operations, assets or
capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the
right to do business for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of
such Tax.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings_. Global and AEHC shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes imposed
on or with respect to the assets, operations or activities of Alliance and the
Alliance Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other Partyยs request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. AEHC further
agrees, upon request and at the sole cost of Global, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on Global or Alliance and
the Alliance Subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby). Notwithstanding the above, the control and
conduct of any Tax Proceeding that is a Third Party Claim shall be governed by
Section 9.4.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. AEHC shall be responsible for the payment of all state
and local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. AEHC and Global shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer
Taxes.

 



 

(d) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any amount paid by a Party to
another Party under Section 9.1 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted under applicable Tax
Law.

 



 

7.7 _Certain Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing, AEHC will provide Global with a list of (i) all
employees of the Alliance Businesses (the "Alliance Employees"), along with
their position and work

 



      
 

 



 

location, (ii) their annual salary or hourly rate, as applicable, and (iii)
their bonus opportunities and accrued or unused vacation time.

 



 

(b) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Section 7.7 are
solely for the benefit of the respective Parties to this Agreement and nothing
in this Section 7.7, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee of the
Alliance Businesses, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.7, express or
implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any plan providing benefits to
any employee, or (ii) construed to prevent Global from terminating or
modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that Global may
establish or maintain.

 



 

7.8 _Exclusive Dealing_. Until the earlier of the Closing and the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and except as
otherwise required in order for AEHC to comply with the terms of Section 7.2,
(a) neither AEHC nor Alliance will solicit offers from, negotiate with, or in
any manner encourage, discuss, or consider any proposal of any other person
relating to the acquisition of Alliance or its material assets, in whole or in
part in any manner, other than the sale of non-material assets in the ordinary
course of business; and (b) AEHC and Alliance shall immediately notify Global
regarding any contact between AEHC, Alliance, or their respective
representatives and any other person regarding any such offer or any related
inquiry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.8 shall
restrict either AEHC or Alliance from soliciting offers from, negotiating
with, or in any manner encouraging, discussing or considering any proposal of
any other person relating to the acquisition of any individual Alliance
location; provided, that neither AEHC nor Alliance will enter into any binding
commitment to sell any individual Alliance location without Globalยs consent
as required under Section 7.1.

 



 

7.9 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) Global and AEHC shall, and AEHC shall cause Alliance to, use their
reasonable efforts (i) to obtain all approvals and consents required by or
necessary for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to
take all appropriate action and to do all things necessary, proper, or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations and this Agreement to effect
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and to timely satisfy the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE IV.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Section 7.8 will require any Party to hold separate or
make any divestiture of any asset or otherwise agree to any restriction on
operations or other condition that would be materially adverse to the assets,
liabilities, or business of Global or Alliance. No Party will be required to
offer or grant financial accommodations to any third party or to remain
secondarily liable with respect to any liability.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, neither Party shall make any filing or request any
consent related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Following the Closing, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents,
instruments, conveyances, and assurances and take such further actions as may
be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing, AEHC agrees to provide Global with copies of all
Affiliate Guarantees known to AEHC; and Global agrees to cooperate with AEHC
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to assume in writing any and all
Affiliate Guarantees and to relieve AEHC of any liability thereunder.

 



 

(f) AEHC will use reasonable efforts to deliver to Global copies of any
historical insurance policies in AEHCยs or Allianceยs possession.

 



 

7.10 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Global agrees that all rights to indemnification and related rights to
advancement of expenses on the part of each person who at the Closing is a
current or former director or officer of Alliance, including all such rights
existing pursuant to Law, Allianceยs certificate of organization and operating
agreement or any written agreement between any such person and Alliance in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall
continue in full force and effect until 180 days after the expiration of the
longest applicable statute of limitation; _provided, however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. Global shall
cause Alliance to comply with its obligations with respect to such rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses.

 



 

(b) If Global or Alliance or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each
such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Global or Alliance shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.10_.

 



 

7.11 _Access, Information and Documents_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date hereof and to the Closing, upon reasonable advance
notice from Global of not less than five (5) Business Days, AEHC shall, to the
extent permitted by Law, permit Global and its authorized representatives to
have reasonable access, during regular business hours, to the assets,
employees, facilities, Contracts, books and records and other documents
relating exclusively to the Alliance Businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such access (or related activities or investigations) shall unreasonably
interfere with AEHCยs normal operations of its businesses, including the
Alliance Businesses; _provided, further,_ that all information received by
Global or its representatives and given by or on behalf of AEHC in connection
with this Agreement and the Transaction will be held by Global and its
subsidiaries, employees, and representatives as confidential information
pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The covenants in Section 7.11(a) will not require AEHC to provide Global
or its representatives with access to any document or other communication that
AEHC believes in good faith may be subject to any contractual confidentiality
obligation or that may be covered by any attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product privilege or similar privilege, or to permit Global or its
representatives to conduct any Environmental Tests, including soil, water, air
or other sampling or testing, at or relating to real property retained by
AEHC.

 



 

(c) From and after the date hereof and to the Closing, without the prior
consent of AEHC, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld by AEHC,
neither Global nor any of its subsidiaries or employees shall contact any
suppliers to, or employees (except pursuant to Section 7.11(a)) or customers
of, the Alliance Businesses in connection with or pertaining to any subject
matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AEHC acknowledges and
agrees that Global has an ongoing relationship with certain suppliers of
Alliance with respect to Globalยs current business operations, and the
foregoing restriction is not intended to limit Globalยs ordinary course of
business with such suppliers.

 



 

7.12 _UST Fund_. Global received no discount or reduction of any kind
regarding the contribution of the Alliance Equity Interests with respect to
known or unknown environmental conditions on any of Allianceยs Retail
Locations, including without limitation any releases of petroleum at
properties now, or which may in the future be, subject to application to the
Connecticut UST Fund Program ("Fund"), and, at Globalยs request, at the
Closing AEHC will assign any and all rights it may have with respect to the
Fund to Global.

 



 

7.13 _Audited Special Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) AEHC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare the
financial statements required by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("
_SEC_ ") (the " _Special Financial Statements_ "), that will be required of
Global or any of its Affiliates by the SEC in connection with reports,
registration statements and other filings to be made by Global or any of its
Affiliates related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange
Act_ "), in such form that such statements and the notes thereto can be
audited by EandY. AEHC (x) shall cooperate with and permit Global to reasonably
participate in the preparation of the Special Financial Statements and (y)
shall provide Global and its representatives with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the personnel of AEHC and its Affiliates who engage
in the preparation of the Special Financial Statements.

 



 

(b) AEHC shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to
EandY such representation letters, in form and substance customary for
representation letters provided to external audit firms by management of
Alliance (if the financial statements are the subject of an audit or are the
subject of a review pursuant to Statement of Accounting Standards 100 (Interim
Financial Information)), as may be reasonably requested by EandY, with respect
to the Special Financial Statements. Global agrees that (i) to the extent any
such representation letter is delivered by any officer, employee, consultant
or director of AEHC, or on its behalf, Global shall indemnify and hold
harmless such officers, employees, consultants or directors and provide a
defense for such officers, employees, consultants and directors (including, in
each

 



      
 

 



 

case, with respect to their own negligence) with regard to the execution,
delivery or any other action related to the provision of such representation
letters to the same extent as any executive officer or director of Global
would be indemnified had they performed such action; (ii) Global shall provide
a customary representation letter to EandY, if reasonably requested; and (iii)
Globalยs existing outside auditors shall provide a customary representation
letter to EandY, if reasonably requested.

 



 

(c) Global will engage EandY to perform an audit of the Special Financial
Statements and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause EandY to issue
unqualified opinions with respect to the Special Financial Statements (the
Special Financial Statements and related audit opinions being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Audited Special Financial Statements_ ") and provide its
written consent for the use of its audit reports with respect to the Special
Financial Statements in reports, registration statements or other documents
filed by Global or any of its Affiliates under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as needed. AEHC shall take all commercially reasonable action
as may be necessary to facilitate the completion of such audit and delivery of
the Audited Special Financial Statements to Global or any of its Affiliates as
soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Global shall reimburse AEHC for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred
by AEHC pursuant to this Section 7.12, including those incurred for the
delivery by EandY to Global of the Audited Special Financial Statements and any
other fees charged by EandY to facilitate Globalยs ongoing compliance with SEC
rules and regulations; provided, however the reimbursable fees and expenses to
AEHC pursuant to this Section 7.13(d) shall be limited to those it would not
otherwise incur but for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
this Section 7.12.

(a) by mutual written consent of Global and AEHC;

 



 

(b) by AEHC if Global shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 4.1 or 4.2, and (ii) (A) cannot be cured
by the End Date or (B) if capable of being cured by the End Date, shall not
have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice

that remains between the date of such written notice and the End Date;

 



 

(c) by Global if AEHC shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this

written notice from Global of such breach or failure to perform or any shorter
period of time that remains between the date of such written notice and the
End Date;

 



 

(d) by either Global or AEHC if (i) any of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE

2012 (as such date is so extended, the " _End Date_ "); _provided, however_ ,
if either Party determines in good faith that additional time is necessary in
order to obtain any approval for the Transaction required by any Governmental
Authority, such Party may extend such date in ninety (90) day increments for
purposes of securing such approval, provided, that no such extension shall
extend to a date beyond September 30, 2012.

Section 8.1, all obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will
terminate, except that the obligations in Section 7.11(a) (with respect to
confidentiality), and Sections 8.2, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 will survive;
_provided, however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated by Global pursuant
to Section 8.1(c), or by AEHC pursuant to Section 8.1(b), then the non-
breaching Partyยs right to pursue all legal and equitable remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired and nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be
deemed to release the breaching Party from any liability for any breach of the
terms, conditions, covenants and other provisions of this Agreement or to
impair the right of non-breaching Party to compel specific performance by the
breaching Party of its obligations under this Agreement. NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN THE EVENT THIS AGREEMENT IS
TERMINATED BY GLOBAL PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.1(c), OR BY AEHC PURSUANT TO
SECTION 8.1(b), IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ITS PERFORMANCE OR
NONPERFORMANCE OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF
THE CLAIM OR WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

either Alliance or either of the Alliance Subsidiaries or any of their

Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, Global shall indemnify and hold

representatives and, solely with respect to the Affiliate Guarantees, Global

for any claims first raised after the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

9.3 _Notice of Claims_.

 



 

(a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this ARTICLE IX (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") has suffered or incurred any Loss (other than one
resulting from a Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall so notify in
writing the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") promptly after obtaining knowledge of such claim, describing such
Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or reasonably capable
of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss, all with reasonable
specificity and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such Loss shall have occurred. A failure to give notice in a
timely manner pursuant to this Section 9.3(a) shall not limit the obligation
of the Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE IX: (i) except to the extent such
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby and (ii) except to the extent
expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was not provided. The
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party
in determining the validity of any claim of indemnity (including reasonable
access to and copies of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to such matters and the making available of employees on a mutually convenient
basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material
relating to such matters). If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within sixty (60) calendar days following its receipt of a
notice delivered pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE IX, such
claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively
determined to be a liability of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) If any Proceeding is instituted by or against a third party with respect
to which the Indemnified Party intends to claim any Liability or expense as a
Loss under this ARTICLE IX, the Indemnified Party shall promptly following
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail of such Proceeding.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly following the Indemnified Partyยs receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and

 



      
 

 



 

documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim. A failure to give notice and to tender the defense
of the Proceeding in a timely manner pursuant to this Section 9.3(b) shall not
limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE IX: (i)
except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby, and for
this purpose, any failure to give notice and to tender the defense that
results in the Indemnifying Party not controlling or participating in such
Proceeding shall be deemed to prejudice the Indemnifying Party, (ii) except to
the extent expenses are incurred during the period in which notice was not
provided, and (iii) except as provided by 9.4 below.

 



 

9.4 _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) The Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE IX shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the
defense or prosecution, as applicable, of any third party claim, action or
suit for which indemnity may be sought under Sections 9.1 or 9.2 (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), and the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party
advance notice of any proposed compromise or settlement; _provided, further_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of such Third Party Claim,
except with the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement (i) which provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages and/or (ii) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim if at the time of
assumption (x) the Indemnifying Party fails to demonstrate its ability to
conduct the defense or prosecution actively and diligently, (y) a majority of
the damages associated with such Third Party Claim are not reasonably expected
to be indemnifiable hereunder or (z) the relief sought in connection with such
Third Party Claim consists primarily of injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party. If it assumes the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party
to participate in, but not control or file any papers in respect of, the
defense or prosecution of any such action or suit through counsel chosen by
the Indemnified Party, _provided_ that the fees and expenses of such counsel
and any counsel retained or used by the Indemnified Party from the time the
Indemnifying Party assumed the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim
shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim (other than during any period in
which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third
Party Claim as provided in Section 9.4). Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
shall have assumed the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim, without the Indemnifying
Partyยs prior written consent. The election of the Indemnifying Party to
assume the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim will not be deemed an
admission by the Indemnifying Party that the claims made in the Third Party
Claim are within the scope of or subject to indemnification under this
Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control or conduct

 



      
 

 



 

the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, but not conduct or control, the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and, at its own expense, to
employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third
Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and, upon the
Indemnifying Partyยs request, the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees on a mutually convenient
basis for providing additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

 



 

9.5 _Expiration_.

 



 

(a) AEHCยs representations and warranties in ARTICLE V shall survive until the
expiration of the indemnification obligations under Section 9.1(a)(ii), except
for the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.7(k), which will
survive the Closing until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

 



 

(b) Globalยs representations and warranties in ARTICLE VI shall survive until
the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) All covenants and agreements of the Parties (including those related to
indemnification in Sections 9.1 and 9.2) shall survive the Closing.

 



 

9.6 _Other Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Global and AEHC shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving
any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to
indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by using commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any such claim or liability. Further, each Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
to, a Loss, including incurring costs but only to the minimum extent necessary
to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss. In the event that Global or
AEHC shall fail to use such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or
resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained herein, the other Party shall not be required to indemnify
any Person for any Loss that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided
if Global or AEHC, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

 



 

(b) The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all insurance proceeds or other payments from third parties. The amount of
Loss for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to seek indemnification
under this Agreement will be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds
or other payment from a third party actually received, realized or retained by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Loss (less
the amount of any expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery). If such
Person, after having received any indemnification payment pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to a Loss, subsequently receives or realizes any
insurance proceeds or other payment, the Indemnified Party will promptly
refund and pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such insurance
proceeds or payment (after deducting therefrom the amount of any expenses
incurred by it in

 



      
 

 



 

procuring such recovery, to the extent such Indemnified Party did not already
receive payment for such expenses from the Indemnifying Party), but not in
excess of any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

 



 

(c) If an Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any claim by a third party, then the appropriate
Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party against such third party, and such Indemnified Party will
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in asserting all
such rights and remedies against such third party.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein, AEHC and its Affiliates shall not in
any event be liable to any Global Indemnitee and Global and its Affiliates
shall not in any event be liable to any AEHC Indemnitee on account of any
indemnity obligation set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.2 (as applicable) for any
indirect, consequential, special, incidental or punitive damages arising out
of, or relating to, this Agreement, the Transaction, the performance or breach
of this Agreement or any liability or obligation retained or assumed under
this Agreement, other than any such damages for which the Indemnified Party is
found liable through the final resolution of a Third Party Claim.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is intended
that the provisions of this Agreement will not result in a duplicative payment
of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall be construed accordingly.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AEHCยs
indemnification obligations under Section 9.1 shall not cover any
Environmental Liabilities relating to or occurring at any property owned,
leased and/or operated by Global or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
Closing, except to the extent such Environmental Liabilities would otherwise
be Allianceยs responsibility pursuant to that certain Facilities Management
Agreement between Alliance and Global Companies LLC or that certain Facilities
Management Agreement between Aliance and Global Montello Group Corp., each
with respect to certain retail gas stations and ancillary uses thereto owned
or leased by Global or one of its subsidiaries prior to the Closing and
managed by Alliance prior to the Closing.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AEHCยs
indemnification obligations under Section 9.1(a)(ii) shall not apply to any
incremental additional Losses due to any Environmental Liability to the extent
that such incremental additional Losses are due to the conduct of Global or
its agents post-Closing which conduct causes a further Release or an increase
in the concentration or area coverage of such Environmental Liability.

 



 

9.7 _Acknowledgements; Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, or any
instrument delivered in connection with the consummation of the Transaction,
Global acknowledges and agrees that, other than with respect to (i) claims of,
or causes of action arising from, fraud, criminal activity or willful
misconduct and (ii) claims for equitable relief related to the breach of any
covenant or agreement of AEHC contained in this Agreement requiring
performance after the Closing, Globalยs and the Global Indemniteeยs sole and
exclusive remedy

 



      
 

 



 

after the Closing with respect to any and all claims against AEHC and its
Affiliates relating to this Agreement, the Transaction, any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law (including,
inter alia, any rights of contribution or recovery under CERCLA or other
Environmental Law) or otherwise shall be pursuant to and limited by the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Global hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud ,
criminal activity or willful misconduct and claims for equitable relief
related to the breach of any covenant or agreement of AEHC contained in this
Agreement requiring performance after the Closing) it or any of its Affiliates
may have against AEHC or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors arising under or based upon
this Agreement, the Transaction, any document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith, or any applicable Law (including, inter alia, any rights
of contribution or recovery under CERCLA or other Environmental Law) or
otherwise, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, AEHCยs liability
with respect to any claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud,
criminal activity or willful misconduct by AEHC shall be unlimited.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, AEHC
acknowledges and agrees that, other than with respect to (i) claims of, or
causes of action arising from, fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct
and (ii) claims for equitable relief related to the breach of any covenant or
agreement of Global contained in this Agreement requiring performance after
the Closing, AEHCยs and the AEHCยs Indemnitiesย sole and exclusive remedy
after the Closing with respect to any and all claims against Global and its
Affiliates relating to this Agreement, the Transaction, any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, the Alliance Businesses, or any
applicable Law (including, inter alia, any rights of contribution or recovery
under CERCLA or other Environmental Law) or otherwise shall be pursuant to and
limited by, the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, AEHC hereby waives, from and after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from, fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct and claims for equitable
relief related to the breach of any covenant or agreement of Global contained
in this Agreement requiring performance after the Closing) it or any of its
Affiliates may have against Global or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors arising under or
based upon this Agreement, the Transaction, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, the Alliance Businesses or any applicable
Law (including, inter alia, any rights of contribution or recovery under
CERCLA or other Environmental Law) or otherwise, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Globalยs liability with respect to any claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, criminal activity or willful
misconduct by Global shall be unlimited.

 



 

(c) EXCEPT AS MAY EXPRESSLY BE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY
MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTION.
