Parent and Acquisition have each (i) determined that the Merger is advisable
and fair and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and (ii)
approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the combination of the Company and Parent shall
be effected by the terms of this Agreement through a transaction in which
Acquisition will merge with and into the Company, the Company will be the

shareholders of the Company will become stockholders of Parent;   WHEREAS,
for Federal income tax purposes it is intended that the Merger qualify as a

Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be the bylaws of
Acquisition in effect at the Effective Time until amended in accordance with
applicable law.   Section 1.6. Directors. The directors of Acquisition at
the  --------- Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, no par value, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock"), each share of Series A Preferred Stock,
no par value, of the Company (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), and each share
of Series B Preferred Stock, no par value, of the Company (the "Series
B Preferred Stock" and together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the
"Preferred Stock" and together with the Common Stock, individually a "Share"
and collectively the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares (as defined hereinafter)
and (ii) Shares held by Parent, Acquisition or any other subsidiary of
Parent) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and
shall become a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to (A) in
the case of a share of the Company Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio (as
defined hereinafter) and (B) in the case of a share of the Preferred Stock
(which shall be convertible immediately before the Effective Time on a one-
to-one conversion rate), the number of shares of Company Common Stock into
which the share of Preferred Stock is convertible immediately before the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the outstanding Shares shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares then the Exchange
Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,

or exchange of shares.   (b) The maximum aggregate consideration payable by
Parent to shareholders of the Company, the holders of Company Stock Options
(as defined hereinafter) and the holder of the Company Warrant in connection
with the Merger (the "Maximum Merger Consideration") shall be that number of

Dollars ($315,000,000), divided by (ii) $49.98125 (the "Exchange Ratio
Determination Price") or 6,302,363 shares.   (c) The "Exchange Ratio" shall
be equal to the quotient of (i) the Maximum Merger Consideration, divided by
(ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (B) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock into which all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible immediately before the Effective Time on a
one-to-one conversion rate, plus (C) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all Company Stock Options,
plus (D) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of all warrants of the Company which remain outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time.   3    (d) At the Effective Time,
each outstanding share of the common stock, no par value per share, of
Acquisition shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) At the
Effective Time, each Share held by Parent, Acquisition or any subsidiary of
Parent or Acquisition immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition, the
Company or the holder thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist and no
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered with respect thereto.  
(f) (i) Without any further action by the holders of the Preferred Stock, the
receipt of shares of Parent Common Stock by such holders pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be
an acknowledgement and agreement by such holders that the shares of Parent
Common Stock that they receive pursuant to the Merger (the "Preferred\'s
Parent Stock") may not be sold or otherwise transferred, pledged or disposed
of (collectively, "Transferred") in any manner, except in accordance with the
following terms and conditions: (i) Fifteen percent (15%) of the Preferred\'s
Parent Stock held by each such holder and their permitted transferees may be
Transferred at any time after the later of (a) the date that is ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, or (b) the expiration date of any lock-up period
(which shall not exceed ninety (90) days) imposed on the officers and
directors of Parent provided that the lock-up period shall have been imposed
on or prior to August 15, 2000; (ii) an additional Fifteen percent (15%) of

Preferred\'s Parent Stock held by such holders and their permitted
transferees may be Transferred at any time after Two Hundred and Seventy
(270) days after the Closing Date; and (iv) all of the Preferred\'s Parent
Stock held by such holders and their permitted transferees may be Transferred
at any time after the first anniversary of the Closing Date.   (ii) Without
any further action by the holders of the Common Stock, the receipt of shares
of Parent Common Stock by such holders pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to be an acknowledgement and agreement by
such holders that the shares of Parent Common Stock and the options to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock that they receive pursuant to the
Merger (collectively, with any shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of any options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock,
the "Common\'s Parent Securities") may not be Transferred in any manner,
except in accordance with the following terms and conditions: (i) Fifteen
percent (15%) of the Common\'s Parent Securities held by such holders and
their permitted transferees may be Transferred upon the later of (a) the date
that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, or (b) the expiration date
of any lock-up period (which shall not exceed ninety (90) days) imposed on
the officers and directors of Parent provided that the lock-up period shall
have been imposed on or prior to August 15, 2000 and (ii) all of the
Common\'s Parent Stock held by such holders and their permitted transferees
may be Transferred at any time after the first anniversary of the Closing
Date.   (iii) Holders of the Preferred\'s Parent Stock and the Common\'s
Parent Securities may gift such securities, Transfer such securities to a
trust where such holders, their spouses and their children are the sole

made in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL ("Dissenting Shares"), will
not be converted into the right to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock
otherwise payable with respect to such Shares at or after the Effective Time
but will be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the
laws of the State of California. If a holder of Dissenting Shares (a
"Dissenting Stockholder") withdraws his, her or its demand for such payment
and appraisal or becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal, then, as
of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event of withdrawal or
ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such holder\'s Dissenting Shares will
cease to be Dissenting Shares and will be converted into the right to
receive, and will be exchangeable for, the shares of Parent Common Stock
into which such Dissenting Shares would have been converted pursuant to
Section 1.8. The Company will give Parent and Acquisition prompt notice, but
in any event no later than three days after receipt of any notice, of any
demand received by the Company from a holder of Dissenting Shares for
appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. The Company agrees
that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as required under
the CGCL, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for appraisal. Each Dissenting
Stockholder who, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL,
becomes entitled to payment of the value of the Dissenting Shares will
receive payment therefor but only after the value therefor has been agreed
upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions unless otherwise
agreed by Parent. Any portion of the Merger Consideration that would
otherwise have been payable with respect to Dissenting Shares will
be retained by Parent.   Section 1.10. Exchange of Certificates. 
------------------------   (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall issue the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that areissuable
pursuant to Section 1.8 and, as required by this Section 1.10, Parent shall
deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or trust institution of
recognized standing selected by Parent and Acquisition (the "Exchange Agent")
for the benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this
Article I: (i) certificates representing the appropriate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 (after the application
of Section 1.10(i)), and (ii) cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock and such cash are
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), in exchange for outstanding
Shares.    (b) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than twenty (20) days) after
the Effective Time, to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") and whose shares were converted into
the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.8:
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form
and have such   5   other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, cash to be paid for fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock and instructions regarding any lost, stolen, destroyed
or mutilated Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and, if applicable, a check representing the cash consideration
to which such holder may be entitled on account of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver such
certificates and cash, if any, to such holder as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the holder\'s properly
completed letter of transmittal and Certificate evidencing his, her or its
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock and, if
applicable, a check representing the amount of consideration payable in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.10, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 1.10.   (c) No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
1.10(f), until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate or such documentation as may be reasonably required regarding any
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificates. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be
promptly paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without
interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.10(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.   (d) In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof
in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, such shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in
its discretion, require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity.  
6    (e) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid pursuant to Section 1.10(c) or 1.10(f)) shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares;
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
date hereof that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers after the Effective Time on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   (f)
No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof, each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fraction
(after aggregating all fractions that such holder may be entitled to) of a
share of Parent Common Stock shall upon surrender of his or her
Certificate or Certificates be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without
interest) determined by multiplying (i) the Exchange Ratio Determination
Price by (ii) the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately
bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that
would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.   (g) Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the shareholders
of the Company upon the expiration of twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and any shareholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article I
shall thereafter look only to Parent as general creditors for payment of
their claim for Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, as
the case may be, and any applicable dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock.   (h) Neither Parent, Acquisition nor the Company
shall be liable to any holder of Shares or Parent Common Stock, as the case
may be, for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (i)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
shall withhold from the shares of Parent Common Stock that are issued at the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.8(a) to each holder of Shares and the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable after the Effective Time upon exercise
of any Company Stock Options or the Company Warrant ten percent (10%) of such
shares (in the aggregate), the "Escrow Shares" and, promptly after
the Effective Time, shall deposit certificates representing the Escrow Shares
with Greater Bay Trust Company or another third person mutually satisfactory
to Parent and the Securityholder Agent, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"),
to be administered and distributed pursuant to the provisions of an
escrow agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit E (the "Escrow
Agreement").  ---------   7    Section 1.11. Stock Options and
Warrants.  --------------------------   (a) At the Effective Time, each
option to purchase Shares (a "Company Stock Option" or collectively "Company
Stock Options") issued pursuant to the Company\'s 1998 Stock Option Plan or
other agreement or arrangement, whether vested or unvested, and outstanding
as of the Effective Time shall be converted as of the Effective Time into
options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Section 1.11. All plans or agreements described above pursuant
to which any Company Stock Option has been issued or may be issued are
referred to collectively as the "Company Plans." Each Company Stock) the
option price, Option shall be deemed the number of shares to constitute an
option purchasable pursuant to acquire a number of to such option and shares
of Parent Common the terms and Stock equal to the conditions of number of
Common Shares exercise of such that the holder of such option shall be
Company Stock Option adjusted as necessary would have been in order to comply
entitled to receive with Section 424(a) pursuant to the Merger of the Code.
had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option, whether or not vested,
in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded to the nearest whole
share) at a price per share (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i)
the aggregate exercise price for the Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to
such Company Stock Option divided by (ii) the product of (A) the number
of Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of
any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options" or
"ISOs") the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
adjusted as necessary in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.  
(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders\' rights pursuant to the Company Plans and that the
agreements evidencing the grants of such options shall continue in effect on
the same terms and conditions including vesting and exercisability (subject
to the adjustments required by this Section 1.11 after giving effect to the
Merger). Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company Plans and the
Company Stock Options and ensure, to the extent required by and subject to
the provisions of such Company Plans, that Company Stock Options that
qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options of Parent after the Effective Time.  
(c) Parent shall cause a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options assumed in accordance
with this Section 1.11 to be reserved for issuance for as long as such
options remain outstanding. Parent shall (i) within ten (10) business
days after the Effective Time, if no registration statement is in effect
covering such shares of Parent Common Stock, file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to any Company Stock Options held by
Persons who are employees within the meaning of Form S-8 and shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding and (ii) by the Effective Time, cause such
shares of Parent Common Stock to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, subject to official notice of issuance.   8    (d) At
the Effective Time, the warrant to the purchase Shares issued to Lighthouse
Capital Partners II, L.P. by the Company (the "Company Warrant") shall,
without any action on the part of the holder, be converted as of
the Effective Time into a warrant to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.11. The Company Warrant shall
be converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that the holder
of such Company Warrant would be entitled to receive under the Company
Warrant multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (except that any resulting fraction
of a share will be rounded to the nearest whole share) at a price per share
equal to (i) the exercise price provided for in the Company Warrant divided
by the Exchange Ratio (except that any resulting exercise price will be
rounded to the nearest whole cent).   (e) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holder of the Company Warrant a
new warrant for shares of Parent Common Stock (the number of which shares
shall be calculated pursuant to subsection 1.11(d) above) on the same terms
and conditions as the Company Warrant.   (f) Parent shall cause a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Company Warrant converted in accordance with this Section 1.11 to be
reserved for issuance for as long as such warrant remains outstanding.  
Section 1.12. Possible Alternative Structure. In the event that Parent, 
------------------------------ in its sole discretion, determines prior to
the Effective Time that there is a material possibility that the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the Merger contemplated by Section
1.1 hereof shall be restructured such that Company shall be merged with and
into Acquisition and Acquisition shall be the surviving corporation. In such
event, all references to the term "Merger" shall be deemed references to the
merger contemplated by this Section 1.8; all references to the term
"Surviving Corporation" shall be deemed references to Acquisition; and all
references to the term "Effective Time" shall be deemed references to the
time at which the certificate of merger is duly filed with the California
Secretary of State or at such later time as is specified in the certificate
of merger with respect to the Merger as restructured in the
manner contemplated by this Section 1.8. Company shall cooperate with Parent
and take all steps necessary to implement this alternative structure.

hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition, subject to
the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Letter (the "Company Disclosure
Letter") delivered by the Company to Parent in accordance with Section 4.13

Default. Except as set forth in Section 2.7 of the  ---------- Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company is not in breach, default or violation (and no

Changes. Except as  ---------------------------------------------- and to
the extent set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet of the Company (including the notes
thereto), other than liabilities and obligations which, individually or in
the aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except
as and to the extent set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, since the Company Balance Sheet Date, there have been no events,
changes or effects with respect to the Company that have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any repurchase, redemption
or other acquisition by the Company of any outstanding shares of capital

except pursuant to any stock purchase agreements to which the Company is a
party; (v) any amendment of any term of any outstanding security of the

intended to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualification and tax-exempt status and nothing has occurred since the date
of such determination letter that could adversely affect the qualification of
such Employee Plan or the tax-exempt status of such related trust. No
event has occurred and, to the knowledge of the Company, there currently

of additional benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting of any benefit
under any Employee Plan or any agreement or arrangement disclosed under this

judgment, decree, stipulation or agreement (other than Inbound License
Agreements) restricting the use thereof by the Company, in the case of any
Intellectual Property licensed to others, restricting the sale, transfer,

diluting, or violating any Intellectual Property owned or exclusively
licensed by the Company, and no such claims have been brought against any
Person by the Company.   (j) Assignment; Change of Control. The execution,
delivery and  ----------------------------- performance by the Company of
this Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will not result in the loss or impairment of, or give
rise to any right of any third party to terminate, any of the Company\'s
rights to own any of its Intellectual Property or its material rights under
the Inbound License Agreements, nor require the consent of any Governmental
Authority or third party in respect of any such material Intellectual
Property.   (k) Software. The Software owned or purported to be owned by
the  -------- Company and used in its business ("Owned Software") set forth
in Section 2.18(k) of the Company Disclosure Letter, was either (i) developed
by employees of Company within the scope of their employment; (ii) developed
by independent contractors who have assigned their rights to the Company
pursuant to written agreements; or (iii) otherwise acquired by the Company
from a third party. The Owned Software does not contain any programming code,
documentation or other materials or development environments that embody
Intellectual Property rights of any Person other than the Company, except for
such materials or development environments obtained by the Company from other
Persons who make such materials or development environments generally
available to all interested purchasers or end-users on standard commercial
terms or as negotiated between the Company any such other Person. For
purposes hereof, "Software" means any and all (i) computer programs,
including any and all software implementations of algorithms, models and
methodologies, whether in source code or object code, (ii) databases and
compilations, including any and all data and collections of data,
whether machine readable or otherwise, (iii) descriptions, flow-charts and

of the Company whose duties or responsibilities relate to the Company\'s

proprietary information agreements with the Company in the form provided to
Parent. To the Company\'s knowledge, no employee   25   or consultant of
the Company whose duties or responsibilities relate to the Company\'s
business is obligated under any agreement (including licenses, covenants or
commitments of any nature) or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any
court or administrative agency, or any other restriction that would interfere
with the use of his or her best efforts to carry out his or her duties for
the Company (other than time commitments of independent contractors to
their other clients) or that would conflict with the Company\'s business. The
carrying on of the Company\'s business by such employees and contractors of
the Company and the conduct of the Company\'s business as presently proposed,
will not, to the Company\'s knowledge, conflict with or result in a breach of
the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any
contract, covenant or instrument under which any of such employees or
consultants or the Company is now obligated. Except as set forth in Section
2.18(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter, it is not necessary to utilize any
inventions or any other Intellectual Property of any employees of or
consultants to the Company (or Persons the Company currently intends to hire)
acquired prior to their employment by the Company in order to carry on the
business of the Company as presently conducted. To the Company\'s knowledge,
at no time during the conception of or reduction to practice of any of
Intellectual Property owned by the Company was any developer, inventor or
other contributor to such Intellectual Property operating under any grants
from any Governmental Entity or private source, performing research sponsored
by any Governmental Entity or private source or subject to any employment
agreement or invention assignment or nondisclosure agreement or other
obligation with any third party that could adversely affect the Company\'s
rights in such Intellectual Property. The Company maintains files and records
which specifically identify each present and past employee, independent
contractor and consultant who participated in a material way in the creation
or development of any Owned Software or any other material Intellectual
Property, and if a past employee and to the extent known by the Company, the
name of the current employer of such past employee. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company maintains files and records which
specifically identify each inventor named in any Owned Patents (either
individually or jointly with others), and indicates whether such inventor is
a current employee of the Company and, if not a current employee of the
Company, (i) the relationship of such inventor to the Company at the time the
respective invention was made and the present relationship, if any, of
such inventor with the Company and (ii) to the extent known by the Company,
the employer and current position of such inventor with such employer.

------------------- Software or other material in connection with the
Company\'s business to any country to which such export or transmission is
restricted by any applicable law, without first having obtained all necessary
and appropriate United States or foreign government licenses or permits.  
(o) Disabling Code and Contaminants. The Company has taken reasonable 
------------------------------- steps and implemented reasonable procedures
to ensure that the Owned Software is free of any disabling codes or
instructions (a "Disabling Code" ), and any virus or other intentionally

used to, intentionally and outside the scope of normal operation of the Owned
Software, access, modify, delete, damage or disable any Systems (as defined
below). The Company has taken reasonable steps and implemented reasonable
procedures to ensure that its internal computer systems used in connection
with the Company\'s business (consisting of hardware, software, databases or
embedded control systems, "Systems" ) are free from Disabling Codes and

in any other materially adverse manner) by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has complied in all material
respects with the provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is the
insured party. No insurer under any Insurance Policy has canceled or
generally disclaimed liability under any such policy or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any such policy. To
the Company\'s knowledge, all material claims under the Insurance Policies
have been filed in a timely fashion.   Section 2.20. Certain Business

by the Company or the conduct of business by the Company. Without limiting
the foregoing, except as set forth in Section 2.21 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company has not entered into any agreement under which the

the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business

Parent. The term "Material Adverse Effect on Parent" means any circumstance,
change in, or effect on Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i)

that would cause such SEC Reports, including the financial and schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein, to contain, as of the date

material fact that would be required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or that would be necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein, as of the date hereof, not misleading.   Section 3.5.

any material respect;   (e) Parent shall have received the opinion of legal

of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other United States federal

shall have become nonappealable or (ii) the Merger has not been consummated
by October 19, 2000 (the "Final Date "); provided that no party may terminate

principal reason that the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before
such date;   (c) by the Company (i) if any representations or warranties of
Parent or Acquisition shall have become untrue such that the conditions set
forth in Section 5.2(a) would be incapable of being satisfied by the Final

obligations, representations or warranties hereunder to an extent that would
entitle Parent or Acquisition to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.1(d); or (ii) if there shall have been a material breach by Parent or
Acquisition of any of their respective covenants or agreements hereunder and
Parent has not cured such breach within fifteen (15) business days after
notice by the Company thereof, such that the conditions set forth in Section
5.2(b) would be incapable of being satisfied within such 15 day period or, if
within 15 days of the Final Date, by the Final Date, provided that the
Company has not breached any of its obligations, representations or
warranties hereunder to an extent that would entitle Parent or Acquisition to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d); or   (d) by Parent and
Acquisition (i) if any representations or warranties of the Company shall
have become untrue such that the conditions set forth in Section 5.3(a) would
be incapable of being satisfied within such 15 day period or, if within 15
days of the Final Date, provided, that neither Parent nor Acquisition has
breached any of their respective obligations hereunder to an extent that
would entitle the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.1(c); (ii) if there shall have been a material breach by the Company of any
of its covenants or agreements hereunder such that the conditions set forth
in Section 5.3(b) would be incapable of being satisfied within such 15
day period or, if within 15 days of the Final Date, by the Final Date,
provided that neither Parent nor Acquisition has breached any of its
obligations hereunder to an extent that would entitle the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(c); (iii) if the Company
shall have ceased using all reasonable efforts to call, give notice of, or
convene or hold a shareholders\' meeting to vote on or to solicit shareholder
written consent of the Merger as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof or shall have adopted a resolution not to effect any of the foregoing;
(iv) if the Company shall have convened a meeting of its shareholders to vote
upon or attempted to obtain the written consent of its shareholders to  
46   approve the Merger and shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote
or consent of its shareholders; or (v) if more than five percent (5%) of the
Shares shall be Dissenting Shares or other Shares with respect to which
dissenter\'s rights have not been terminated.   Section 6.2. Effect of
Termination. In the event of the termination and 
--------------------- abandonment of this Agreement by the Company or Parent
and Acquisition pursuant to Section 6.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect without any liability on the part of any party
hereto or its Affiliates, directors, officers or shareholders other than the
provisions of this Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 and the provisions of all of
Articles VII and VIII (other than Section 8.7, in which case, the only
clauses that shall survive shall be the clauses in such section that contain
defined terms that are referenced in the foregoing surviving sections);
provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or, prior to the
Effective Time, for any intentional breach of such party\'s representations,
warrants, covenants or obligations contained herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever, then
for a one (1) year period thereafter, neither Parent or Acquisition nor the
Company shall directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, through
any existing or future Affiliate of such party), solicit any existing and
future employee of the other party (or any existing or future Affiliate of
such party) to leave his or her employment with such other party or knowingly
induce or knowingly attempt to induce any such employee to terminate or
breach his or her employment agreement, if any, with such other party or
any existing or future Affiliate of the party.   Section 6.3. Fees and
Expenses.  -----------------   (a) Each party shall bear its own expenses
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 6.4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended
by action taken by  --------- mutual agreement of the Company, Parent and
Acquisition at any time before or after approval of the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company, but after any such shareholder approval is
obtained, no amendment shall be made that requires the approval of such
shareholders under applicable law without such approval. This Agreement
(including, subject to Section 4.12, the Company Disclosure Letter) may be
amended only by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties
hereto.   Section 6.5. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time,  ----------------- each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument, in writing, signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.   47    ARTICLE VII    INDEMNIFICATION  
Section 7.1. General Survival. The parties agree that, regardless of 
---------------- any investigation made by the Parent and Acquisition, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements (in the case of
covenants and agreements, to the extent of performance or non-performance
prior to the Effective Time) of the Company contained in this Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement for a period beginning
on the date hereof and ending at 5:00 p.m., California time, on the first
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the "Survival
Period"). The parties agree that, regardless of any investigation made by the
Company, the representations and warranties of Parent contained in this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this agreement for a
period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the last day of the statute
of limitations period applicable to claims made under federal and state
securities laws applicable to any such breached representation and warranty;
provided, however, that any claim under contract law shall not survive beyond
the one year anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs.  
Section 7.2. Indemnification Provisions in General. 
-------------------------------------   (a) Subject to Section 7.1, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent, Acquisition and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders,
representatives and agents (collectively the "Indemnitees") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by each former shareholder of the Company, but
only from and to the extent of such shareholder\'s pro rata portion of the
Escrow Amount, from and against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred
by, resulting from, arising out of, relating to, imposed upon or incurred by
Parent, Acquisition, the Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnitee by
reason of:   (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
Company\'s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements (to the
extent of performance or non-performance prior to the Closing Date) contained
in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party; and   (ii) any misrepresentation contained in the Company Disclosure
Letter, in any other written statement or certificate furnished to Parent,
Acquisition or any other Indemnitee by or on behalf of the Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Documents or in any information provided by the Company
in the Hearing Notice or the Information Statement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Losses" means any and all judgments, settlements,
demands, claims, suits, actions or causes of action,
assessments, liabilities, losses, damages (whether direct, indirect,
incidental or consequential), interest, fines, penalties, costs, expenses
(including reasonable legal, accounting and other costs and expenses of
professionals) incurred in connection with investigating, defending, settling
or satisfying any and all demands, claims, actions, causes of action, suits,
proceedings, assessments, judgments or appeals, and in seeking
indemnification therefor.   48    (b) Any claims for indemnification
hereunder must be set forth in writing, contain a reasonably detailed
description of the nature of and the events or circumstances underlying the
claim for indemnification hereunder and be received by the Securityholder
Agent not later than the expiration of the Survival Period (a "Survival
Period Indemnification Claim").   (c) No Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for any Losses until the aggregate amount of all
Losses under all Survival Period Indemnification Claims shall exceed One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Deductible"), at which time the
Indemnitees shall be subject to indemnification only to the extent that the
aggregate of all losses exceeds the amount of the Deductible; provided,
however, that the provisions of this Subsection (c) shall not apply with
respect to Losses in respect of any Survival Period Indemnification Claim
arising out of any breach of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Sections 2.2 and 2.17, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to indemnification in the event of a breach of
such Sections without applicability of the Deductible.   (d) No Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any Losses for which no
Survival Period Indemnification Claim is made prior to the expiration of the
Survival Period.   (e) Any indemnification payments made from the Escrow
Account pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall constitute an adjustment to the
dollar amount of the aggregate consideration payable by Parent to the holders
of the capital stock of the Company.   Section 7.3. Manner of
Indemnification.  --------------------------   (a) To provide a fund
against which an Indemnitee may assert Survival Period Indemnification Claim
under this Article VII, the Escrow Amount shall be withheld and deposited
into escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in accordance with Section
1.10(i). The Escrow Shares so deposited, and interest and other earnings
payable thereon, shall be held and distributed in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement. Shares deposited into escrow shall be valued, for the purposes of
satisfying any Survival Period Indemnification Claim, at the average closing
price of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for
the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date on which
the Survival Period Indemnification Claim is paid.   (b) Each Survival
Period Indemnification Claim shall be made only in accordance with this
Article VII and the Escrow Agreement.   Section 7.4. Securityholder Agent. 
--------------------   (a) For purposes of this Agreement, immediately
and automatically upon the approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote
or written consent of the Company\'s shareholders, and, without any further
action on the part of any such shareholders, each shareholder of the Company
shall be deemed to have consented to the appointment of Steve Dines, as his,
her or its representative (the "Securityholder Agent") and the attorney-in-
fact for and on behalf of each such Company shareholder, and the taking by
the Securityholder Agent of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by him   49   under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement,
including the exercise of the power to (i) execute the Escrow Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement, (ii) authorize delivery to Parent and
Acquisition of the Escrow Shares, or any portion thereof, in satisfaction of
Survival Period Indemnification Claims, (iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such Survival Period Indemnification Claims, (iv)
resolve any Survival Period Indemnification Claims and (v) take all actions
necessary in the judgment of the Securityholder Agent for the accomplishment
of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.
Accordingly, the Securityholder Agent has unlimited authority and power to
act on behalf of each Company shareholder with respect to this Agreement, the
Registration Rights Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the disposition,
settlement or other handling of all Survival Period Indemnification Claims,
rights or obligations arising from and taken pursuant to each such agreement.
The Company shareholders will be bound by all actions taken by
the Securityholder Agent in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, and Parent and Acquisition
shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Securityholder
Agent. The Securityholder Agent will incur no liability with respect to any
action taken or suffered by him or her in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by him
or her to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper Person (and shall
have no responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any
other action or inaction, except his or her own willful misconduct or gross
negligence. In all questions arising under this Agreement, the Registration
Rights Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Securityholder Agent may rely
on the advice of counsel, and the Securityholder Agent will not be liable to
anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Securityholder Agent based on such advice. The Securityholder Agent will not
be required to take any action involving any expense unless the payment of
such expense is made or provided for in a manner satisfactory to him or her.
At any time, holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Shares,
determined at the Effective Time, may appoint a new Securityholder Agent by
written consent by sending notice and a copy of the written consent
appointing such new Securityholder Agent signed by holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Shares to Parent and the Escrow Agent.
Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in
the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent, Acquisition (or,
if after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow
Agent.   (b) The Securityholder Agent will serve without
compensation; provided, however, that the Securityholder Agent will be
compensated at an hourly rate of $100 for any time in excess of fifty hours
in the aggregate that he spends in performing the duties of the
Securityholder Agent, in addition to any reasonable expenses the
Securityholder Agent may incur in performing the duties of the Securityholder
Agent. The Securityholder Agent shall be entitled to make an assessment
against the shareholders of the Company in respect of the Securityholder
Agent\'s time charges or expenses. Such assessment shall be made by written
notice to the Company\'s shareholders in the manner provided in
this Agreement for the giving of notice, in an amount equal to each
shareholder\'s pro rata share of any assessment (such pro rata share being
based upon the respective ownership interests of the Company\'s shareholders
as of the Closing Date and the due date for payment of the assessment and
shall specify in reasonable detail the facts or circumstances giving rise to
the assessment. Each of the Company\'s shareholders shall make payment in
full of its share of any assessment no later than ten (10)  
50   calendar days after the payment date specified in the notice of
assessment. In the event a Company shareholder does not pay the full amount
of such shareholder\'s pro-rata share of the assessment, the Securityholder
Agent shall be entitled to payment from such shareholder in the amount shown
in the notice of assessment, plus an additional 25% of the requested
assessment as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) for failure to timely
pay the assessment, in addition to any costs of collection, including
reasonable attorney\'s fees and court costs. If a Company shareholder fails
to pay all or any portion of the amount owed by such shareholder and such
failure continues for at least sixty (60) days, the Securityholder Agent
shall be entitled to receive payment from the Escrow Account, which payment
shall in no event exceed such shareholder\'s pro rata portion of the Escrow
Shares and shall result in a corresponding reduction of the shares such
shareholder is entitled to receive upon distribution of the Escrow Shares.
For purposes of satisfying any such payment, shares deposited into escrow
shall be valued at the average closing price of Parent Common Stock as
reported on the NASDAQ National Market for the five trading days immediately
preceding the date on which the payment is made. Pending application of the
proceeds of an assessment, the Securityholder Agent shall deposit the
proceeds of an assessment in a money market demand account at a commercial
bank having an office in Santa Clara County, California. Such account will
also serve as the depository for any excess funds remaining after application
of the proceeds of an assessment, provided that any assessment funds that
remain unused for a period of ninety (90) days shall be returned to
the appropriate Company shareholder.   Section 7.5. Third-Party Claims. If
Parent becomes aware of a third-  ------------------ party claim that Parent
believes, in good faith, may result in the assertion by it of a Survival
Period Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Shares, Parent shall promptly
notify the Securityholder Agent of such claim, and the Securityholder Agent,
as representative for the Company shareholders, shall be entitled to
participate in any defense of such third party claim. The reasonable costs of
the defense of any third-party action or claim incurred by the Securityholder
Agent shall be paid by the Company shareholders out of the Escrow Shares.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall conduct such
defense, but shall not settle any such claim without the prior written
consent of the Securityholder Agent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that, if the consent of the
Securityholder Agent is so obtained, such settlement of that portion of any
such claim shall alone be determinative of the amount (but not the right of
Parent to receive payment from the Escrow Shares) of the Survival Period
Indemnification Claim and neither the Securityholder Agent nor any Person who
has a beneficial interest in the Escrow Shares shall have any power or
authority to object under any provision of this Article VII to the amount of
(but shall not be precluded from contesting the right of Parent to make) any
demand by Parent against the Escrow Shares with respect to such
settlement.   Section 7.6. Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding any other
provision of  ---------------- this Agreement to the contrary, following the
Effective Time, the Escrow Shares shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Indemnitees for, and no shareholder of the Company shall have any
personal liability whatsoever in respect of, any Survival Period
Indemnification Claims arising under this Agreement, including claims of
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement. Neither
the Escrow Agent nor the Securityholder Agent shall transfer any other
property other than the Escrow Shares in satisfaction of any Survival Period
Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the first two sentences of this
Section 7.6, nothing in this Agreement   51   shall be deemed a waiver by
any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief, or any
right or remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation with the respect to this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party or any right set forth
in Section 6.2.   ARTICLE VIII    MISCELLANEOUS   Section 8.1. Entire
Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including 
---------------------------- the Company Disclosure Letter) (a) constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings
both written and oral between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and (b) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise;
provided, however, that Acquisition may assign any or all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Acquisition of its respective obligations hereunder if such assignee does not
perform such obligations.   Section 8.2. Validity. If any provision of this
Agreement or the  -------- application thereof to any Person or circumstance
is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby and to such end the provisions of this Agreement are agreed
to be severable.   Section 8.3. Notices. All notices, requests, claims,
demands and  ------- other communications hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by
delivery in Person, by facsimile, by registered or certified mail (postage
prepaid, return receipt requested) or sent by nationally-recognized overnight
courier to each other party as set forth below or to such other address as
the party to whom notice is to be given may have furnished to the other
parties hereto in writing in accordance herewith. Any such notice or
communication shall be deemed to have been delivered and received (a) in the
case of personal delivery, on the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of
facsimile, on the date sent if confirmation of receipt is received and such
notice is also promptly mailed by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested), (c) in the case of a nationally- recognized overnight
courier in circumstances under which such courier guarantees next business
day delivery, on the next business day after the date when sent and (d) in
the case of mailing, on the fourth business day following that on which the
piece of mail containing such communication is posted:   if to Parent or

existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Parent
has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
its properties and assets and conduct its business as is currently conducted
and to our knowledge is qualified as foreign corporation in every
jurisdiction where the conduct of its business or leasing of properties

in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (ii) Each of
Parent and Acquisition has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver the Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby.   (iii) The execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement
and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party by each of
Parent and Acquisition and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the boards of directors of
Parent and Acquisition and by Parent as the sole stockholder of Acquisition,
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Acquisition are
necessary to authorize the Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents to which they are parties or to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby.   (iv) The Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Documents to which they are parties have been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Acquisition and constitute the valid and
binding agreements of Parent and Acquisition, enforceable against each of
Parent and Acquisition in accordance with their respective terms.   (v)
Neither the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement and each of
the other Transaction Documents to which they are parties by Parent
