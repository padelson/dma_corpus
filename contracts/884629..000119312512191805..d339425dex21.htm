   3.21 | If the Purchaser becomes aware of any Leakage, it shall notify
the Primary Indirect Interest Holders and, where relevant, the Managers
Representative as soon as reasonably practicable and if, at the time of such
notification:

     | (a) | the Completion Statement has not become binding on the
parties in accordance with Schedule 10 ( _Completion Statement_ ), the parties
shall procure that the Completion Statement shall be prepared in such a
manner that such Leakage is added to the Cash Balances; and

---|---

   3.28 | If the total amounts apportioned pursuant to Clause 3.27 (other

---|--- 



     | (a) | the amount apportioned to the APH4 Intra Group Debt shall be
reduced by the amount of such excess, provided that the amount apportioned to
the APH4 Intra Group Debt shall not be less than 1; and

---|---|--- 
 





 

48 and Landsbanki their respective Indirect Interest Holder Warranty Proportions
of the amounts then standing to the credit of the Warranty Escrow Account.

intend, promptly after the date of this Agreement, to modify one or more of
this Agreement, the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the Warranty Escrow
Agreement and the Interim Covenant Escrow Agreement to require each of DB and
Landsbanki, conditional on withdrawal of funds from the Escrow Accounts as
contemplated in Clause 3.31, to substitute in exchange for receiving its (i)
Indirect Interest Holder Adjustment Proportion of the amounts then standing to
the credit of the Adjustment Escrow Account and Interim Covenant Escrow
Account, and (ii) Warranty Escrow Proportion of the amounts then standing to
the credit of the Warranty Escrow Account, a covenant to pay to the Purchaser

Interest Holder Adjustment Proportion of any claim that could otherwise
have been claimed against the Adjustment Escrow Account or the Interim
Covenant Escrow Account and (y) its Indirect Interest Holder Warranty
Proportion of any claim that could otherwise have been claimed against the

any substitution under this Clause 3.32, the parties agree that the liability
of the Vendor, where limited by reference to the amount standing to the credit
of any escrow account, will be unaffected by any payment to DB or Landsbanki
as contemplated in Clause 3.32. The parties agree to use their best endeavours
to enter into such agreements as are necessary to reflect the above.

circumstance or condition existing. If at the time when the other Conditions

the Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all necessary merger
clearances and similar approvals with respect to the Transaction, and the

Fabrizio Campelli, David McDiarmid or Philipp von Girsewald (each a
"Designated Person") has actual knowledge (without having made any enquiry)
of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to give rise to a Full
Enforcement (any of these "Circumstances"), 
---|---|--- 
 





 

59 DB shall send to the Purchaser a copy of such Notice or Certificate or, to the
extent a Designated Person has become aware of Circumstances, notify the
Purchaser in writing promptly thereafter and shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, promptly consult with the Purchaser in relation to (i) any event
that is reasonably likely to give rise to a Full Enforcement that is
disclosed in such Notice or Certificate or (ii) any Circumstances, or (iii)
any action or proposed response to be taken by DB or a Group Company in
relation thereto. DB shall not be obliged to take or not to take any course
of action as a result of such consultation. The Purchaser and the Purchaser

termination provide to the Purchaser (i) any material information in relation
to the circumstances giving rise to such Full Enforcement that has not already
been provided to the Purchaser and (ii) such information as the Purchaser will
require in order to determine the amount of Subsequent Sale Net Proceeds that
is not less than the amount of Compass Net Proceeds. 
---|--- 



   5.20 | Following any Enforcement Termination

a Subsequent Sale Contract with the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | DB hereby agrees to negotiate exclusively with the Purchaser
for a period of 2 Business Days following the date of such termination with a
view to negotiating a possible Subsequent Sale Contract with the Purchaser or

substantially the same terms as the exclusivity agreement dated 29 March 2012
between the Purchaser and AGH relating to the Transaction, other than the
following: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | there will be a 90 day period of exclusivity (the
"Exclusivity Period"); 
---|---|--- 
 





 

60 shall negotiate in good faith in relation to a sale of the Group for an amount
of Subsequent Sale Net Proceeds that is not less than the amount of Compass
Net Proceeds and otherwise on terms substantially equivalent to those set out
in this Agreement taking into account any changes to the transaction structure
to the extent required as a result of steps taken in anticipation of or
following the Full Enforcement. 
---|---|--- 



   5.21 | If (a) no Subsequent Sale Contract is entered into with the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and (b) the Purchaser remains committed
throughout the Exclusivity Period to working in good faith towards entering
into a Subsequent Sale Contract on the terms set out in Clause 5.20(d)(ii),

Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to which, in aggregate, the amount
of Subsequent Sale Net Proceeds are in excess of the amount of the Compass Net
Proceeds, DB shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the lesser of: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the amount of such excess; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the aggregate of: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Purchasers third-party advisory costs, fees or

the Purchaser on the receipt by DB of the Subsequent Sale Proceeds giving rise
to the obligation to make such payment.

   5.23 | The Purchaser and DB agree to discuss in good faith the
provision by the Group, with effect from Completion, of security, collateral
or other forms of credit support in a form satisfactory to the Purchaser and
DB in relation to the foreign exchange contracts between DB or its Affiliates

Purchaser and the Vendor that the foreign exchange contracts entered into
between DB or its Affiliates and the Group with a date of expiry after the
Completion Date will either:

being a "Close-out Notice"; or

costs, fees or expenses incurred, paid or payable by any Group Company under
such engagement letters shall constitute Transaction Costs; and

      | (b) | the Group shall be entitled to waive or otherwise
extinguish the Intra-Group Balances.

the case may be, and shall continue in respect of Confidential Information
until such time as the information ceases to be confidential. 
---|--- 



   14.8 | This Clause 14 ( _Confidentiality and Announcements_ ) is
intended to ensure that the sale of the Interests (or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement) will be treated as not having been offered
under "conditions of confidentiality" for purposes of section 1.6011 4(b)(3)
of the U.S. Treasury Regulations (or any successor provision) and for purposes
of any similar provision of any applicable Law, and shall be construed in a
manner consistent with such purpose. In furtherance of this purpose, and
notwithstanding anything herein or in any other document, agreement or
understanding relating to the sale of Interests (or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement), no party (or its Affiliates) imposes any
limitation (whether legally binding or not) on the disclosure by the other
party of the U.S. federal, state or local tax treatment or tax structure of
the sale of the Interests (or any such other transaction). For these
purposes, "Tax treatment" means any purported or claimed tax treatment, and
"tax structure" means any fact that may be relevant to understanding the tax
treatment. This Clause 14.8 applies only to the tax treatment and tax
structure referred to herein, and is not intended to permit disclosure of any
other item, detail or information.

   15. | FURTHER ASSURANCE 
---|--- 



   15.1 |

an Indirect Interest Holder and not as an employee or officer of a Group
Company) shall (and the Vendor shall procure that the Vendor Group shall), at
its own cost, promptly execute and deliver all  

---|--- 
 





 

73 information and assistance (excluding in the case of DB (i) exercising any
rights in relation to the DB Purchaser Services or (ii) where to do so would
be inconsistent with the DB Rights), as the Vendor or an Indirect Interest
Holder or (as the case may be) the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably
require for the purpose of giving full effect to the provisions of this
Agreement and to secure for that person the full benefit of the rights, powers
and remedies conferred upon it under this Agreement provided that the
obligations of the Vendor under this Clause 15.1 shall terminate with effect
on the date falling six months after the Completion Date, however DB shall
not be under any obligation under this Clause 15.1 where such obligations
would conflict with its rights under the Restructuring Deed. 
---|--- 
 



   15.2 | The Purchaser acknowledges that the Indirect Interest Holders
intend to liquidate the Vendor Group and Argon as soon as is practicable
following the date being six months after the Completion Date and the
Purchaser shall not take any action to delay or otherwise frustrate the
liquidation of the Vendor Group or Argon, and shall promptly provide all such
information and assistance as the Primary Indirect Interest Holders may from
time to time reasonably require (including providing access to financial and
tax personnel of the Group) for the purpose of giving effect to the
liquidation of the Vendor Group as soon as is practicable following the
date being six months after the Completion Date provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, this Clause 15.2 shall not restrict the Purchaser from
exercising any of its rights against the Vendor pursuant to this Agreement or
prejudice any rights or remedies available to the Purchaser.

any other agreement, this Agreement shall prevail (as between the parties to
this Agreement) unless:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | such other agreement expressly states that it overrides this
Agreement in the relevant respect; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the parties to this Agreement are all either also parties to
that other agreement or otherwise expressly agree in writing that such other
agreement shall override this Agreement in that respect. 
---|---|--- 



   16.3 |

Save in respect of any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation (or
the delay in the discovery of which is the consequence of fraud or fraudulent
concealment), each of the parties agree and acknowledge that it has not relied
on any Superseded Representation in entering into this Agreement or into any
other Transaction Document or in making any decision in relation to the sale
and purchase of the Interests, the assumption of the AI Payable or otherwise,
and that it will not contend to the contrary. Each of the parties agree and
acknowledge that other than in relation to fraud, it only has a right and
remedy in relation to a Superseded Representation of and to the extent that
the Superseded Representation is set out in this Agreement, and its only right
and remedy shall be for breach of the terms of this Agreement. Each party

Transaction if the Conditions shall be satisfied or waived or deemed waived

satisfied at Completion), and each party acknowledges that specific
performance is an appropriate and expected remedy.

or in part be released, compounded or compromised or time or indulgence given
by the Purchaser in its absolute discretion as regards the Vendor or an
Indirect Interest Holder under such liability without in any way prejudicing

Indirect Interest Holder under the same or a like liability whether joint or
several or otherwise. 
---|--- 



   16.6 | This Clause 16.6 shall apply in relation to the Superseded

any other person or entity other than such party.

each Indirect Interest Holder agrees:

Representatives shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or
indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature and none of the Indirect

   17. | POST-COMPLETION EFFECT OF AGREEMENT 
---|--- 



   17.1 | Notwithstanding Completion: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | each provision of this Agreement and any other Transaction
Document not performed at or before Completion but which remains capable of
performance;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Warranties; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | all covenants, indemnities and other undertakings and
assurances contained in or entered into pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document,  
---|---|--- 

will remain in full force and effect until performed or they expire in

constitute a waiver of any rights of the Purchaser.



   17.2 | The Vendor and Argon shall provide the Purchaser with 30 days
notice of its intention to liquidate the Vendor Group and Argon, respectively
provided always that:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Vendor and Argon shall not commence formal voluntary

Completion Date; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | nothing shall prejudice the rights of the Purchaser with
respect to any claim notified to the Vendor or the Primary Indirect Interest
Holders (as applicable) prior to the date of the delivery of such notice. 
---|---|--- 



   17.3 | Except as provided in Clause 17.4 below, neither the Vendor nor
Argon shall be liable in respect of any claim for breach of this Agreement
unless the Purchaser or the Purchaser Guarantor has given notice in writing
of such claim to the Vendor or Argon (as applicable) on or prior to the date
which falls 5 months following the Completion Date. 
---|--- 
 



   17.4 | Nothing in Clause 17.3 shall limit the rights of the Purchaser

---|--- 
 





 

76 ---|--- 



   18.1 | A failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy
provided under this Agreement or by Law, whether by conduct or otherwise,
shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall
it preclude or restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or
remedy. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy provided under
this Agreement or by Law, whether by conduct or otherwise, shall preclude or
restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. For the
avoidance of doubt, a written notice delivered by the Purchaser as
contemplated by paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of Mutually
Agreed Condition Failure shall not constitute a waiver by the Purchaser of
any of its rights under this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   18.2 | A party that waives a right or remedy provided under this
Agreement or by Law in relation to another party does not affect its rights in
relation to any other party.  
---|--- 



   18.3 | A waiver of any right or remedy under this Agreement shall only
be effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent breach or default.  
---|---

unless it is with the consent in writing of all the parties, save that the
Purchaser and the Primary Indirect Interest Holders shall be entitled to
amend this Agreement without the consent of the other parties in writing,
provided that no such amendment shall be made which would be materially and
disproportionately adverse to the economic, tax or legal position of the
Managers without the consent of the Managers Representative (with such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
---|--- 



   18.5 | Unless expressly agreed, no variation or amendment shall
constitute a general waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor shall it
affect any rights or obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement which
have already accrued up to the date of variation or amendment and the rights
and obligations under or pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect except and only to the extent that they are varied or amended. 
---|--- 



   18.6 | Each Manager hereby irrevocably (by way of security for the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement) appoints the Managers
Representative as his agent (whether acting severally or jointly) with full
authority on its behalf and in the Managers name or otherwise to do all acts
and to execute and deliver such documents or deeds as are required by law or
as may, in the reasonable opinion of the Managers Representative, be
required to give effect to the matters reserved to it pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   18.7 | Each Manager acknowledges that in exercising the powers and
authorities conferred by this Clause 18.7 upon the Managers Representative
they shall not be acting, or be construed as acting, as the agent or trustee

Representative shall have no liability whatsoever to any other party in
relation to the exercise of those powers and authorities, save to a Manager
in the case of fraud or wilful concealment. 
---|--- 



   19. | INVALIDITY 
---|--- 

Where any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the Laws of any jurisdiction then such
provision shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement and, if possible,
replaced with a lawful provision which, as closely as possible, gives effect
to the intention of the parties under this Agreement and, where permissible,
that shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability in
that, or any other, jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement.

 





 

77 ---|--- 



   20.1 | Except as provided in this Clause 20 ( _Assignment_ ) or as the
Purchaser and the Primary Indirect Interest Holders specifically agree in
writing, no person shall assign, transfer, charge or otherwise deal with all
or any of its rights under this Agreement nor grant, declare, create or
dispose of any right or interest in it. 
---|--- 
 



   20.2 | Subject to Clause 20.5, the Purchaser may assign the benefit of
this Agreement and/or of any other Transaction Document to which it is a

shall be on the basis that: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | the Vendor, each Indirect Interest Holder and the Purchaser

Holder to any assignee shall not be greater than its liability would have been

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the liability of the Purchaser Guarantor to any assignee
shall not be greater than its liability to the Vendor and each Indirect
Interest Holder;  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | the Purchaser, the Purchaser Guarantor, the Vendor and each
Indirect Interest Holder will remain liable for their respective obligations
under this Agreement; and

where the benefit of any rights is divided between two or more persons in
specified proportions:  
---|---|---

   21. | PAYMENTS, SET OFF, DEFAULT INTEREST AND DOUBLE RECOVERY 
---|--- 



   21.1 | Any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement by the

Vendors Bank Account and any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement
by any party to the Purchaser shall be made to the Purchasers Bank Account,
in each case by way of electronic transfer in immediately available funds on
or before the due date for payment. Receipt of such sum in such account on or
before the due date for payment shall be a good discharge by the payor of its
obligation to make such payment. 
---|--- 



   21.2 | Where any payment is made in satisfaction of a liability arising
under this Agreement (including the payment of any Due Amount to the Purchaser
from the Warranty Escrow Account, the Interim Covenant Escrow Account or the
Contingent Consideration Escrow Account) it shall be an adjustment to the
Final Cash Consideration. 
---|--- 



   21.3 |

All payments made by any party to this Agreement under this Agreement, or any
of the other Transaction Documents, shall be made free from any set-
off, counterclaim or other deduction or withholding of any nature whatsoever,
except for deductions or withholdings required to be made by Law. If any
deductions or withholdings are required by Law to be made from any such
payments (other than a payment made pursuant to Clause 3 (Consideration),
4.7, 9 (Warranty Escrow Account), 10 (Interim Covenant Escrow Account), 11
(Indemnity), Schedule 12 ( _Contingent Consideration_ ) or paragraph 4 of
Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or any payment of interest), the amount of the
payment shall be increased by such amount as will, after the deduction or
withholding has been made, leave the recipient of the payment with the same
amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such
requirement to make a deduction or withholding. If any deductions or
withholdings are required by Law to be made from any payments made pursuant to
Clause 3 (Consideration), 4.7, 9 (Warranty Escrow Account), 10 (Interim
Covenant Escrow Account), 11 (Indemnity), Schedule 12 ( _Contingent
Consideration_ ) or paragraph 4 of Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) (excluding
interest and dividends), and a deduction or withholding is actually made at
the time of the payment the amount of the payment shall be increased by such
amount as will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave the
recipient with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive in
the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding, less
an amount equal to fifty per cent. of the amount of the withholding or
deduction that has been made and, for the avoidance of doubt, paragraphs
11.1(a) and 11.2 of Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) shall not apply to any
Tax liability arising in respect of such deduction or withholding. If prior
to making any payment pursuant to Clause 3 (Consideration), 4.7, 9 (Warranty
Escrow Account), 10 (Interim Covenant Escrow Account), 11 (Indemnity),
Schedule 12 ( _Contingent Consideration)_ or paragraph 4 of Schedule 9 ( _Tax
Covenant_ ) (excluding interest and dividends), the payer becomes aware that
it could be required by Law to withhold or deduct an amount pursuant to this
Clause 21.3, it shall notify the recipient as soon as reasonably practicable
and the payer and the recipient shall consult in good faith with a view to
reducing or mitigating any such withholding or deduction. If the payer makes a
deduction or withholding required by Law from any payment, it shall pay the
full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax Authority within the time
allowed under applicable Law and shall deliver to the recipient of the payment
as soon as reasonably practicable an original receipt or other appropriate
evidence issued by the relevant Tax Authority evidencing the payment to such
Tax Authority of all amounts so required to be deducted or withheld from such
payment. If any additional amount is  

---|--- 
 





 

79 Account or the Interim Covenant Escrow Account pursuant to this Clause 21.3,
the Primary Indirect Interest Holders and the Purchaser shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, jointly instruct the Warranty Escrow Agent or the
Interim Covenant Escrow Agent, as appropriate, in writing to make such
payments as are necessary to give effect to this Clause 21.3, to the extent
that sufficient funds are standing to the credit of the relevant Escrow
Account. 
---|--- 



   21.4 | The recipient or expected recipient of a payment under this
Agreement, or any of the other Transaction Documents shall take all reasonable
steps to claim from the appropriate Tax Authority any exemption rate
reduction, refund, credit or similar benefit (including pursuant to any
relevant double tax treaty) to which it is entitled in respect of any
deduction or withholding in respect of which a payment has been or would
otherwise be required to be made pursuant to Clause 21.3 and, for such
purposes, shall take all reasonable steps, within any applicable time limits,
submit any claims, notices returns or applications and send a copy thereof to
the payer. 
---|--- 



   21.5 | If within 2 years of a payment made under this Agreement, or any
of the other Transaction Documents, the recipient of such payment receives and
utilizes a credit for or receives a refund of any Tax payable by it or
similar benefit by reason of any deduction or withholding for or on account of
Tax then it shall reimburse to the other party such part of such additional
amounts paid to it pursuant to Clause 21.3 above as the recipient of the
payment certifies to the other party will leave it (after such reimbursement)
in no better and no worse position than it would have been if the other party
had not been required to make such deduction or withholding.  
---|--- 



   21.6 | If any Tax Authority charges to Tax, other than by way of
withholding or deduction, any sum (other than any payment pursuant to Clause 3
(Consideration), 4.7, 9 (Warranty Escrow Account), 10 (Interim Covenant
Escrow Account), 11 (Indemnity), Schedule 12 ( _Contingent Consideration_ ) or
paragraph 4 of Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or any payment of interest) paid
(the "original payment") to a payee under this Agreement, the payer shall be
obliged to pay to the payee such additional amount (the "additional amount")
as will ensure that, after the payment of the Tax so charged on the original
payment and any Tax chargeable on the additional payment (after giving credit
for any Tax relief available to the recipient in respect of the matter giving
rise to the payment), there shall remain a net sum equal to the amount of the
original payment. The additional payment shall be paid within five (5)
Business Days of notice by the payee to the payer notifying that Tax on the
original payment has become due and payable, or would have become due and
payable but for the availability of, in the case of payment by the Vendor, a
Purchasers Relief or, in the case of a payment by either of the Purchaser,
any Relief. If any Tax Authority charges to Tax any sum payable to the
Purchaser pursuant to Clauses 3 (Consideration), 4.7, 9 (Warranty Escrow
Account), 10 (Interim Covenant Escrow Account), 11 (Indemnity), Schedule 12 (
_Contingent Consideration_ ) or paragraph 4 of Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ )
Tax Covenant (excluding interest), the provisions of paragraph 11.1(ii) of
Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) shall apply. 
---|--- 



   21.7 | Where the Vendor or the Purchaser defaults in the payment when
due of any damages or other sum payable by virtue of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Documents the liability of the Vendor or the Purchaser (as
the case may be) shall be increased to include an amount equal to interest on
such sum from the date when payment is due to the date of actual payment (both
before and after judgment) at that annual rate which is 4% per annum above
the base lending rate of HSBC Bank plc from time to time in effect during such
period. Such interest shall accrue from day to day and shall be payable
without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Vendor or the
Purchaser (as the case may be) in respect of such default.

indemnity more than once in respect of the same loss, regardless of whether
more than one claim arises in respect of it.

Vendor and the Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith in preparing: (1) a
draft plan setting forth in reasonable detail the steps to implement the
Icelandic Debt Elimination; and (2) drafts of all agreements and ancillary
documents necessary to implement the Icelandic Debt Elimination. As soon as

agreements and documents by the Vendor and the Purchaser, and subject to the
Vendor Group being indemnified (on an after Tax basis) for any losses suffered
or incurred in connection therewith by the Vendor Group but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Group Company, the Vendor and the Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith to cause the Icelandic Debt Elimination to be
implemented according to such plans and pursuant to agreements and documents.
The Vendor shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed of the progress on the
implementation of the Icelandic Debt Elimination and shall deliver, or cause

ordinary course of business; and (b) intercompany balances related to the
Groups cash pooling arrangements): (i) no Group Company has outstanding any
cash advances to an Icelandic Debtor; and (ii) no new Icelandic Upstream Debt
or Icelandic Receivables are outstanding, which have come into existence since
the completion of the Icelandic Debt Elimination.

and discharge any Claim, Specified Claim or Interim Covenant Claim in respect
of the same liability and vice versa. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Purchaser may not receive duplicate recovery under this Agreement in respect
of the same liability. 
---|--- 



   6.3 | For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall not be entitled
to make any Specified Claim (other than a Bribery Indemnity Claim) for amounts
in excess of the Warranty Escrow Amount unless and until the aggregate Due
Amount in respect of all Claims and Tax Claims equals or exceeds 35 million. 
---|--- 



   6.4 | The Purchaser shall have no Claim or Tax Claim in respect of any
deferred Tax asset or any non-availability thereof unless and to the extent
that such deferred Tax was taken into account as an asset in the Net Working
Capital Statement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by means of reducing
or extinguishing a provision for any liability to Tax in the Net Working
Capital Statement). 
---|--- 
 



   7. |

CONDUCT OF CLAIMS 

---|--- 



   7.1 | If the Purchaser becomes aware of any fact, matter or
circumstance that may result in a Claim, Indirect Interest Holder Claim or
Interim Covenant Claim, the Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practicable
give notice to the Vendor or the Primary Indirect Interest Holders (as the
case may be) of such information as is reasonably available to the Purchaser
to enable the Vendor or the Primary Indirect Interest Holders (as the case
may be) to assess the merits of the potential claim. No failure by the
Purchaser to comply with the provisions of this paragraph 7.1 shall limit the
liability of the Vendor or the Primary Indirect Interest Holders (as the case
may be) to the Purchaser under this Agreement (or the ability of the Purchaser
to make a Claim, Indirect Interest Holder Claim or Interim Covenant Claim),
except to the extent that the amount of the Claim, Indirect Interest Holder
Claim or Interim Covenant Claim is increased as a result of such failure (but
then only with respect to such increase). 
---|--- 



   7.2 | If the fact, matter or circumstance that gives rise to a Claim,
Indirect Interest Holder Claim or Interim Covenant Claim is a result of or in
connection with a claim by a third party (a "Third Party Claim") then,
without prejudice to the rights of the insurers of the Purchasers Group and
subject to the rights of Chartis Europe Limited under the Warranty and
Indemnity Insurance Policy:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Purchaser shall, as far as reasonably practicable,
consult with the Vendor and the Primary Indirect Interest Holders before
taking any action in relation to the Third Party Claim; 
---|---|--- 
 





 

152 be made by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers
Group and the Third Party Claim shall not be compromised, disposed of or
settled without the consent of the Vendor and the Primary Indirect Interest
Holders (as the case may be); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | subject to the Primary Indirect Interest Holders
indemnifying the Purchaser or other members of the Purchasers Group concerned
against all costs and expenses (including legal and professional costs and
expenses) that may be incurred thereby, the Purchaser shall, or the Purchaser
shall procure that any members of the Purchasers Group shall, take such
action as the Vendor and the Primary Indirect Interest Holders (as the case
may be) may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist,
appeal, compromise or contest the Third Party Claim. 
---|---|--- 



    7.3 | Notwithstanding paragraph 7.2, neither the Purchaser nor any
member of the Purchasers Group shall be required to take any action or
refrain from taking any action, if the Purchaser or other member of the
Purchasers Group concerned reasonably considers such action or omission to be
materially prejudicial to it or to its business, would be misleading or
inaccurate in any material respect or would materially affect the future
liability to Tax of any member of the Purchasers Group. 
---|--- 



   7.4 | The Purchaser shall not be precluded from bringing any Claim or
Interim Covenant Claim by reason of any breach of paragraph 7.2. 
---|--- 
 



   7.5 | For the avoidance of doubt, no Warrantor other than then the
Vendor shall have any rights in relation to this paragraph 7\. 
---|--- 
 



   8. | VENDOR ACCESS 
---|--- 

In the event of a Claim, Specified Claim or Interim Covenant Claim, the
Purchaser shall, subject to the Vendor or the Primary Indirect Interest Holder
giving such undertakings as to confidentiality as the Purchaser may reasonably
require, procure that the Vendor or the Primary Indirect Interest Holders and
its Representatives are provided, upon reasonable notice and during Working
Hours, access to such information, records, premises and personnel of the
relevant Group Companies as the Vendor or the Primary Indirect Interest
Holders may reasonably require (not being any which would otherwise be subject
to legal privilege) to investigate, avoid, remedy, dispute, resist, appeal,
compromise or contest such Claim, Specified Claim or Interim Covenant Claim
(as applicable).



   9. | FRAUD AND WILFUL CONCEALMENT 
---|--- 



   9.1 | The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule 8 (
_Limitations on Liability_ ) shall not apply: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | subject to paragraph 9.1(c) below, in respect of the
liability of a Warrantor (as the case may be) where a Claim, Specified Claim,
Tax Claim or Interim Covenant Claim if it is (or the delay in the discovery
of which is) the consequence of fraud or wilful concealment of such Warrantor; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | in respect of the liability of Argon or any Indirect
Interest Holder where an Indirect Interest Holder Claim if it is (or the delay
in the discovery of which is) the consequence of fraud or wilful concealment
of Argon or that Indirect Interest Holder, respectively; or 
---|---|--- 
 





 

153 such Manager will have no liability other than where: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | the Purchaser has no remaining recourse to the Vendor in
respect of a Fraud-based Claim; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | Fraud-based Claim arises as a consequence of the fraud of
such Manager against the Purchaser or the Purchaser Guarantor; and

     | (iii) | notice in writing of such Fraud-based Claim is given to
the relevant Manager no later than 31 March 2014.

provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall apply in relation to the

on the part of any person or entity (including an agent) other than such
party.

Indirect Interest Holders, with respect to an Indirect Interest Holder Claim,
shall be liable for a Claim in respect of any matter, act, omission or

matter or circumstance and any losses arising therefrom, to the extent that
the same would not have occurred but for:  
---|---

---|--- 

The Vendor shall not be liable for any Claim or Interim Covenant Claim (as
the case may be) to the extent that the losses in respect of which such Claim

of the Purchasers Group under a policy of insurance.



   12. | PURCHASER KNOWLEDGE 
---|---

or circumstances giving rise to the relevant Claim were actually known by the
Purchaser prior to the signing of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   12.2 |

For the purposes of paragraph 12.1 and paragraph 7 of Schedule 13, the
knowledge of the Purchaser and the Purchaser Guarantor, respectively, shall

     | (d) | all costs reasonably incurred by the Purchaser or a Group

---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | a Tax Liability of the kind referred to in paragraphs
1.1(a), (b) or (c) or any Demand therefor in respect of which a successful
claim is made by the Purchaser under this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ); or

     | (ii) | successfully taking or defending any action under this

provided that where the liability in question relates to a Group Company which
was not a wholly owned subsidiary of the Vendor immediately before
Completion, the amount payable by the Vendor to the Purchaser under paragraphs
1.1(a) to (c) shall be reduced proportionately to reflect the percentage of
the relevant Group Company owned (directly or indirectly) by the

amount of a Deemed Tax Liability of a Group Company is:

---|--- 
 

The Vendor shall not be liable under paragraph 1.1(a), (b) or (c) of this
Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or for breach of the Tax Warranties to the
extent that:



   2.1 | provision or reserve was made or reflected in the Net Working
Capital Amount in respect of the liability in question or the liability in
question was otherwise included in the computation of the Net Working Capital
Amount; 
---|--- 



   2.2 | the liability in question has been paid or discharged prior to
Completion; 
---|--- 
 



   2.3 |

the liability in question arises or is increased as a result of: (i) any
change in legislation (including a change in subordinate legislation) after
Completion; (ii) a published change in the previously published position of
any Tax Authority after Completion; (iii) a change after Completion in the
clear weight of judicial authority interpreting legislation beyond which there
is no right of appeal in the relevant jurisdiction; or (iv) or an increase in
the rates of Tax after Completion, in each case not actually or prospectively
in force or 

---|--- 
 





 

158 doubt, a clarification of law, legislation or published practice, including a
clarification of an issue or matter on which there was previously no clear
guidance, shall not constitute a "change" for purposes of this paragraph 2.3; 
---|--- 



   2.4 | the liability in question would not have arisen but for a
voluntary act of any member of the Purchasers Tax Group at any time, but in
the case of a Group Company after Completion, only in circumstances where the
Purchaser knew or ought reasonably to have known that the liability in
question would have arisen as a result of the voluntary act and where an
alternative course of action was available that would have reduced or
eliminated the liability, and which has been carried out otherwise than
pursuant to a legally binding obligation (whether or not conditional) entered
into by any Group Company on or before Completion. For the avoidance of
doubt:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | any act carried out pursuant to any obligation under
legislation or regulations relating to Tax or any other requirement imposed by
a Tax Authority (including the filing of any Tax Return); 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | any act carried out at the written request of, or with the
written consent of, the Vendor; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | any act carried out pursuant to this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | any act occurring in the ordinary course of business of the
relevant Group Company (as such business was carried on or before the date of
this Agreement, provided such business was carried on in accordance with
applicable Laws); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | any disclosure to a Tax Authority by any member of the
Purchasers Tax Group or any Group Company acting reasonably and in good
faith, 
---|---|--- 
 

shall not be a voluntary act for these purposes;



   2.5 | the liability in question would not have arisen but for the
failure or omission on the part of a Group Company after Completion to make a
valid claim, election, surrender or disclaimer or to give a valid notice or
consent, under the provisions of an enactment or regulation relating to Tax,
the making, giving or doing of which was taken into account in the Net Working
Capital Amount and of which the Purchaser had received written notice from
the Vendor at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the procedural,
administrative, legal or statutory deadline for the making, giving or doing of
such claim, election, surrender, disclaimer, notice or consent, provided that
no such notice is required to be given in the case of a claim, election,
surrender, disclaimer, notice or consent that is of a kind that is routine in
nature and/or done by the relevant Group company in the ordinary course of
filing or submitting any Tax return; 
---|--- 



   2.6 | the liability in question arises or is increased solely as a
consequence of any change (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any change
with retrospective effect) after Completion in any accounting policy or
practice adopted by a Group Company, unless such change is to rectify a
failure to apply a generally accepted accounting policy applicable at the
relevant time; 
---|--- 
 



   2.7 | the liability in question arises from the ordinary course of
business of the relevant Group Company after the Calculation Date up to
Completion (but, for the avoidance of doubt, Completion itself shall not be
regarded as "ordinary course of business"); 
---|--- 



   2.8 | the liability in question arises solely as a result of a failure
by the Purchaser to comply with any of its obligations under paragraph 3 (
_Manner of Making and Conduct of Claims_ ), 4 ( _Payment of Claims_ ) or 5 (
_Tax Returns and Computations_ ) of this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ); 
---|--- 
 





 

159 attributable to unreasonable delay by the Purchaser, or the relevant Group
Company, in paying Tax to a Tax Authority following a payment by the Vendor
of an amount in respect of such Tax pursuant to a Tax Claim; 
---|--- 



   2.10 | a Relief (other than a Purchasers Relief) is available and can
actually be used to reduce or eliminate the liability in question, provided it
has not already been taken into account under paragraph 6 or 8 or it is not a
Relief in respect of which a payment has been made under paragraph 9 ( _Tax
Refunds_ ); 
---|--- 
 



   2.11 | the liability in question would not have arisen but for any act
(including an act which results in a loss of Relief (other than a Purchasers
Relief) where such Relief would otherwise have been available and could
actually have been used to reduce or eliminate the liability in question,
provided it has not otherwise been taken into account in reducing or
extinguishing a liability of the Vendor under paragraph 1.1 of this Schedule
9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or for breach of the Tax Warranties as a result of
paragraph 2.10) carried out by the Vendor or any Group Company (in the case of
a Group Company, on or before Completion) at the written request of the
Purchaser (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, entering into the Relevant
Agreements) provided that such act is carried out in the manner requested in
any such request. For the avoidance of doubt, a loss of Relief for
the purposes of this paragraph 2.11 shall not include the loss of any saving
or reduction of Tax or any double taxation credit, relief or refund available
only by reason of the payment of Tax to which the liability in question
referred to at the beginning of this paragraph 2.11 relates; 
---|--- 



   2.12 | the liability in question would not have arisen but for the Pre-
Completion Restructuring or any matter undertaken pursuant to paragraphs
1.1(g) or (h) of Schedule 3 ( _Interim Period Obligations_ ); 
---|--- 



   2.13 | any income or profits to which the liability in question is
attributable were actually earned or received by any Group Company on or
before Completion, but such income or profits were not reflected in the Net
Working Capital Amount and do not arise as a result of a breach of the
Vendors obligations pursuant to Schedule 3 ( _Interim Period Obligations_ )
(which causes the Purchaser to suffer a loss), provided such income or
profits are actually retained by the relevant Group Company at the Completion
Date; or 
---|--- 



   2.14 | the liability in question is in respect of Transfer Taxes
payable in connection with this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.  
---|--- 



   3. | MANNER OF MAKING AND CONDUCT OF CLAIMS 
---|--- 



   3.1 | If the Purchaser or a Group Company becomes aware of a Demand
which reasonably could be expected to give rise to a liability for the Vendor
under paragraph 1.1 of this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or under the Tax
Warranties: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Purchaser shall give written notice to the Vendor of the
Demand (including reasonable particulars of the Demand, the due date for
payment and the time limits for any appeal) as soon as reasonably practicable
and in any event not more than fifteen (15) Business Days after the Purchaser
or the relevant Group Company becomes aware of the Demand (but for the
avoidance of doubt, the giving of such notice shall not be a condition
precedent to the liability of the Vendor under this Schedule 9 ( _Tax
Covenant_ ) or under the Tax Warranties); 
---|---|--- 
 





 

160 of any such Demand, provided that the Purchaser shall take (or shall procure
that a Group Company shall take) all such action as the Vendor may reasonably
request to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal, compromise or defend the Demand;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Purchaser shall keep the Vendor informed of any material
developments (including any meetings) and shall provide the Vendor with copies
of all material correspondence and documentation and such other information,
assistance and access to records, books and accounts and personnel as it
reasonably requires, in each case, relating to the Demand referred to in
paragraph 3.1(a).  
---|---|--- 



   3.2 | The rights of the Vendor under paragraph 3.1 (other than the
right to receive notice) are subject to the rights of Chartis Europe Limited
under the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance Policy and subject to the Vendor
having indemnified the Purchaser and/or the relevant Group Company (as
applicable) against all costs reasonably and properly incurred and any further
liability to Tax which may be incurred in connection with any such action as
is referred to in paragraph 3.1(b). 
---|--- 



   3.3 | Subject to paragraph 3.4, and the rights of Chartis Europe
Limited under the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance Policy, the Purchaser must
not, and shall procure that no Group Company shall, make any admission of
liability to any Tax Authority or in relation to any Demand of which
notification has been given under paragraph 3.1(a) above or settle, dispose of
or otherwise compromise any matter relating to the Demand referred to in
paragraph 3.1 without the Vendors prior written consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, an "admission
of liability" within the meaning of the prior sentence shall not mean
disclosure or provision of any factual information to any Tax Authority or in
relation to any Demand. 
---|--- 



   3.4 | If the Vendor does not request the Purchaser to take, or procure
the taking of, any such action as mentioned in paragraph 3.1(b) within fifteen
(15) Business Days of receipt of notice by the Vendor under paragraph 3.1(a),
or the Vendor does not indemnify the Purchaser and/or the relevant Group
Company as required by paragraph 3.2 within a reasonable period of time
following written request from the Purchaser to the Vendor for the same, the
Purchaser shall be free to satisfy or settle the relevant Tax Liability on
such terms as it may reasonably think fit, provided that the Purchaser or
Group Company concerned has notified the Vendor in writing of its intention
so to deal with the matter and the Vendor has not responded within five (5)
Business Days requesting the Purchaser to take, or procure the taking of, any
such action as is mentioned in paragraph 3.1(b) or indemnifying the Purchaser
and/or the relevant Group Company as the case may be. 
---|--- 



   3.5 | The Vendor will not be entitled to request the Purchaser to take,
or procure the taking of, an action which involves an appeal beyond the first
appellate court in the relevant jurisdiction without an opinion from jointly
chosen and nationally recognised leading Tax counsel that the appeal will, on
the balance of probabilities, be won. 
---|--- 
 



   4. | PAYMENT OF CLAIMS 
---|--- 



   4.1 | The due day for payment of any liability of the Vendor under this
Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) shall be: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | in the case of an Actual Tax Liability, the day which is the
later of five (5) Business Days after a written demand is made for payment by
or on behalf of the Purchaser, and five (5) Business Days before the date on
which that Tax becomes due and payable to the relevant Tax Authority; 
---|---|--- 
 





 

161 the later of five (5) Business Days after a written demand is made for payment
by or on behalf of the Purchaser and: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | in the case of the loss of or failure to obtain an Accounts
Relief which is a right to repayment of Tax, the day on which the repayment
would otherwise have been obtained; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | in the case of the loss of or failure to obtain any other
Accounts Relief, five (5) Business Days before Tax which would otherwise have
been saved becomes due and payable to the relevant Tax Authority; or

off is due and payable to the relevant Tax Authority; and

     | (c) | in any other case, five (5) Business Days after the date on
which written demand is made for payment by or on behalf of the Purchaser,

Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Warranty Escrow Agent or Interim

of the Warranty Escrow Account or the Interim Covenant Escrow Account (as
applicable) the amount of the payment due or, if less, the amount standing to

which an amount of Tax becomes due and payable to the relevant Tax Authority
will be the last day on which such Tax may by law be paid without incurring a
penalty or liability for interest in respect thereof, provided that, in the
case of an Actual Tax Liability: 
---|---

due and payable is postponed following an application to the relevant Tax
Authority, court or tribunal, the due date for payment by the Vendor shall be
five (5) Business Days before such later date when the amount of Tax becomes
due and payable; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if a payment or payments to the relevant Tax Authority prior

procure that the Tax in question (or the appropriate part of it) is promptly
paid to the relevant Tax Authority.  
---|---|---

applies in relation to the submission of any Tax Documents or Transfer Tax
Documents, the Purchaser shall ensure that the Vendor receives the Tax
Documents or Transfer Tax Documents no later than twenty (20) Business Days
before the expiry of the time limit (or, if a shorter time limit applies in
relation to the submission of the relevant Tax Documents or Transfer Tax
Documents, as soon as is reasonably practicable); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Vendor or its duly authorised agents must comment within
ten (10) Business Days (or, if a shorter time limit applies in relation to the
submission of the relevant Tax Documents or Transfer Tax Documents, within
such time as will reasonably enable the Purchaser to file the Tax Documents or
Transfer Tax Documents within the applicable time period) of their receipt of
any such Tax Documents or Transfer Tax Documents from the Purchaser, and if

respect of any Tax Documents or other matters relating to Tax which relate
solely to an Event or Events occurring (or treated as occurring) after
Completion. 
---|--- 



   6. | THIRD PARTY RECOVERY 
---|--- 



   6.1 | If the Vendor at any time pays to the Purchaser an amount under
this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or the Tax Warranties (the "Original
Payment") and the Purchaser or a Group Company is, or within two (2) years of
such payment becomes, entitled to recover from some other person (other than a
member of the Purchasers Tax Group and excluding any recovery under the
Warranty and Indemnity Insurance Policy) any sum in respect of the matter
giving rise to the Original Payment (other than by reason of the use or set
off of a Purchasers Relief and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
non-cash saving or reduction of Tax or any non-cash Tax credit arising in
respect of the matter giving rise to the Original Payment), the Purchaser will
(and will procure that the relevant Group Company will) as soon as reasonably
practicable notify the Vendor of such entitlement and will, if so requested
by the Vendor and upon the Purchaser being indemnified to its reasonable
satisfaction against all costs, losses or damages which may thereby be
reasonably incurred, take all reasonable steps to enforce such
recovery, keeping the Vendor informed of the progress of any action taken
(provided that neither the relevant Group Company nor the Purchaser will be
obliged to take any action which it reasonably considers to be materially
prejudicial to its interests), and the Purchaser shall within five (5)
Business Days of such recovery pay to the Vendor, the lesser of: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the sum so recovered by the Purchaser or the Group Company
(as applicable) from the other person (including sums recovered in respect of
costs and any interest or repayment supplement received in respect of the sum
recovered (to the extent that the interest or repayment supplement relates to
the period following the payment by the Vendor to the Purchaser), but less:
(i) an amount equal to any Tax liability for which the Vendor would have been
liable under this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or the Tax Warranties but for
paragraph 1.2 of Schedule 8 ( _Limitations on Liability_ ) and which has not
already been taken into account under this paragraph 6 ( _Third Party
Recovery_ ) or under paragraph 9 ( _Tax Refunds_ ); (ii) any reasonable costs
of recovery not previously reimbursed; and (iii) any Tax chargeable on the sum
recovered); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the amount paid by the Vendor to the Purchaser as referred
to above less the amount of any Tax liability for which the Vendor would have
been liable under this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or the Tax Warranties
but for paragraphs 1.2 of Schedule 8 ( _Limitations on Liability_ ) and which
has not already been taken into account under this paragraph 6 ( _Third Party
Recovery_ ) or under paragraph 9 ( _Tax Refunds_ ); 
---|---|--- 

save that where the Purchaser has received both a payment under this Schedule
9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or the Tax Warranties and a payment under the Warranty
and Indemnity Insurance Policy in respect of the same matter (the "Aggregate
Payment"), this paragraph 6 ( _Third Party Recovery_ ) shall only apply to
the proportion of any sum recovered by the Purchaser in respect of such
matter as the payment received under this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or the
Tax Warranties bears to the Aggregate Payment.

 





 

164 shall be: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | subject to paragraph 6.3, if payment under paragraph 6.1 is
due to be made when no amount stands to the credit of the Warranty Escrow
Account, the Vendor; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | if payment under paragraph 6.1 is due to be made when any
amount stands to the credit of the Warranty Escrow Account, the Warranty
Escrow Account.  
---|---|--- 



   6.3 | No payment shall be made to the Vendor pursuant to paragraph 6.1
to the extent any payment is due from the Vendor pursuant to this Agreement
(in which case such amount shall reduce the payment due from the Vendor
accordingly). 
---|--- 



   6.4 | To the extent that there is any excess of the recovered sum after
the amount paid to the Purchaser under paragraph 6.1 (or the amount that would
have been paid if paragraph 6.3 did not apply) and after deduction of an
amount equal to any Tax liability for which the Vendor would have been liable
under this Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or the Tax Warranties but for
paragraph 1.2 of Schedule 8 ( _Limitations on Liability_ ) (to the extent not
already deducted under paragraph 6.1 and which has not already been taken into
account under this paragraph 6 ( _Third Party Recovery_ ) or under paragraph 9
( _Tax Refunds_ )) the Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor the lesser of: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the amount of such excess (less any reasonable costs of
recovery not previously reimbursed and less any Tax chargeable on the sum
recovered); and  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | an amount equal to interest on the amount paid to the
Purchaser by the Vendor referred to in paragraph 6.1 above, from the date on
which such payment was made until the date the payment of the sum recovered
by the Purchaser is made to the Vendor pursuant to paragraph 6.1 above, at an
annual rate which is 4% per annum above the base lending rate of HSBC Bank plc
from time to time in effect during such period. 
---|---|--- 



   6.5 | This paragraph 6 ( _Third Party Recovery_ ) shall not apply to
any entitlement to recover to which the provisions of Clauses 21.4 and 21.5
apply.  
---|--- 



   7. | SECONDARY LIABILITIES 
---|--- 



   7.1 | The Purchaser covenants with the Vendor to pay to the Vendor an
amount equivalent to any Tax or any amount on account of Tax (other than any
Tax or any amount on account of Tax which arises as a result of a failure by
the Purchaser to make any deduction or withholding required by Law to be
deducted or withheld from any payment made under this Agreement) which any
member of the Vendors Tax Group is required to pay to a Tax Authority as a
result of a failure by a Group Company (after the Completion Date), or any
other member of the Purchasers Tax Group (before or after the Completion
Date) (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Group Company) to discharge
that Tax. 
---|--- 



   7.2 | The Vendor covenants with the Purchaser to pay to the Purchaser
an amount equivalent to any Tax or any amount on account of Tax (other than
any Tax or any amount on account of Tax which arises as a result of a failure
by the Vendor to make any deduction or withholding required by Law to be
deducted or withheld from any payment made under this Agreement) which a Group
Company or any other member of the Purchasers Tax Group is required to pay
to a Tax Authority as a result of a failure by any member of the Vendors Tax
Group to discharge that Tax. 
---|--- 
 





 

165 ---|--- 



     | (a) | extend to any costs reasonably and properly incurred in
connection with such Tax or a successful claim under in paragraphs 7.1 and
7.2, as the case may be;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | (in the case of paragraph 7.1) not apply to Tax to the
extent that the Purchaser could claim payment in respect of it under paragraph
1.1 or the Tax Warranties or to the extent that the Purchaser would have been
able to claim payment in respect of it under paragraph 1.1 or the Tax
Warranties but for paragraph 1 or 2 of Schedule 8 ( _Limitations on Liability_
) in each case;  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | not apply to Tax to the extent it has been recovered by a
Group Company or any member of the Purchasers Tax Group, or the Vendor (as
relevant) under any relevant statutory provision (and the Purchaser or the
Vendor, as the case may be, shall procure that no such recovery is sought to
the extent that payment is made hereunder); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | (in the case of paragraph 7.2) not apply to Tax that is
payable or suffered in respect of any transaction of a Group Company: (i)
where such Tax is primarily attributable to the Group Company and not to any
other participant in the transaction; or (ii) by reference to any profits
earned, accrued, received or otherwise recognised by a Group Company. 
---|---|--- 
 



   7.4 | Paragraphs 2.1, 2.8, 3 ( _Manner of Making and Conduct of Claims_
) and 4 ( _Payments of Claims_ ) will apply to the covenants contained in
paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 as they apply to the covenants contained in paragraph
1.1, replacing references to the "Vendor" by the "Purchaser" (and the other
way round, as the case may be) where appropriate, and making any other
necessary modifications. 
---|--- 



   7.5 | The limitations set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 8 (
_Limitations on Liability_ ) to this Agreement will not apply to the covenants
contained in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2. 
---|--- 



   8. | SAVINGS/OVER-PROVISIONS 
---|--- 



   8.1 | If the auditors for the time being of a Group Company certify in
writing (at the request and expense of the Vendor) to the Vendor and the
Purchaser that:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | applying the accounting policies, principles and practices
adopted in the preparation of the Net Working Capital Amount, any provision
for Tax (other than a provision for deferred tax) in the Net Working Capital
Amount is demonstrated (for reasons other than the availability of a
Purchasers Relief or any transactions occurring or deemed to have occurred
after Completion) to be an over-provision (the amount of such over-provision
being referred to as an "Over-provision"); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the assets in respect of Tax of any Group Company are
demonstrated to have been understated in the Net Working Capital Amount,
except to the extent:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the assets are in respect of deferred tax; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the assets are in respect of a refund to which paragraph
9.1 applies; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | the understatement is attributable to a Purchasers Relief
or arises in circumstances to which paragraph 6.1 applies, 
---|---|--- 
 

(an "Understatement"); or

 





 

166 falling due pursuant to paragraph 1 or the Tax Warranties gives rise to an
actual saving of Tax (a "Saving") for a Group Company or the Purchaser
(provided that this paragraph 8.1(c) shall not apply to the extent that a
Saving has been taken into account in determining the amount of the payment
due from the Vendor pursuant to paragraph 1 or the Tax Warranties or to the
extent that the Saving is a refund to which paragraph 9.1 applies), 
---|---|--- 

then the amount of the Over-provision, Understatement or Saving shall be set
off against any payment then due from the Vendor under this Schedule 9 ( _Tax
Covenant_ ) or under the Tax Warranties or for breach of the Tax Warranties
or (to the extent that it is not so set off) carried forward and set off
against any future payments which become due from the Vendor under this
Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or for breach of the Tax Warranties. 



   8.2 | If the Purchaser has made a claim against the Vendor under this
Schedule 9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or for breach of any Tax Warranty and any Group
Company or the Purchaser discovers or has discovered that there has been an
Over-provision, Understatement or Saving, the Purchaser shall, or shall
procure that the Group Company concerned shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable give notice in writing to the Vendor and the Purchaser shall, or
shall procure that the Group Company concerned shall, (at the Vendors cost)
supply to the Vendor such information as it may reasonably require to verify
the amount of the Over-provision, Understatement or Saving. 
---|--- 



   8.3 | For the purposes of paragraph 8.1 a person obtains a Saving if as
a result of the circumstances which result in a claim by the Purchaser under
paragraph 1 or the Tax Warranties that person is relieved in whole or in part
of a liability to make some other payment of Tax which it would otherwise have
been liable to make and for which the Vendor is not liable under this Schedule
9 ( _Tax Covenant_ ) or under the Tax Warranties or obtains a right to
repayment of Tax which would not otherwise have been available. 
---|--- 



   8.4 | The Purchaser shall procure that each Group Company shall, to the
extent it constitutes reasonable Tax planning to do so, utilise available
Reliefs to give rise to a Saving, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this paragraph 8.4 shall require the Purchaser to procure that such
Reliefs are so utilised to the extent that Purchasers Reliefs are available
to be utilised in priority to such Reliefs. 
---|--- 



   8.5 | Where any such certification as is mentioned in paragraph 8.1 has
been made, the Purchaser may request (at the cost of the Purchaser) the
auditors for the time being of the relevant Group Company to review such
certification in light of all relevant circumstances, including any facts
which have become known only since such certification, and to certify whether
such certification remains correct or whether, in light of those
circumstances, the amount that was the subject of such certification should be
amended. 
---|--- 



   8.6 | If the auditors certify under paragraph 8.5 that an amount
previously certified should be amended, that amended amount shall be
substituted for the purposes of paragraph 8.1 as the amount of the Over-
provision, Understatement or Saving (as relevant) in respect of the
certification in question in place of the amount originally certified, and an
adjusting payment (if any) shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable by
the Vendor to put the Purchaser (and the relevant Group Company) in the same
position it would have been in if the amount of the Over-provision,
Understatement or Saving (as relevant) had always been the amended amount
and not the amount originally certified. 
---|--- 



   8.7 |

The Purchaser and the Vendor shall cooperate in good faith in seeking to
ensure that the auditors for the time being of the relevant Group
Company shall provide such certifications are requested pursuant to this
paragraph 8\. If the auditors for the time being 

---|--- 
 





 

167 (20) Business Days of being so requested, to provide any certification as
requested of them for the purposes of this paragraph 8, then such firm of
accountants as the Vendor and the Purchaser shall agree to appoint (or, in the
event that the Vendor and the Purchaser cannot so agree within ten (10)
Business Days of one of them requesting such agreement from the other, as
shall be appointed at the request of either of them by the President for the
time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales)
shall provide such certification instead and references in this paragraph 8
to the auditors of a Group Company shall, in respect of that certification, be
read as being a reference to the firm of accountants so appointed. 
---|--- 
 



   8.8 | The same amount shall not be dealt with more than once under this
paragraph 8 ( _Savings/Over-provisions_ ) and paragraphs 6 ( _Third Party
Recovery_ ) and 9 ( _Tax Refunds_ ). 
---|--- 



   9. | TAX REFUNDS 
---|--- 



   9.1 | For the purposes of this paragraph 9 ( _Tax Refunds_ ), the "Tax
Refund" means the sum of all refunds of Tax received by the Group
Companies from a Tax Authority within two (2) years of the Completion Date in
respect of a period (in respect of which Tax is assessed or charged on that
Group Company) or part of a period ending on or before Completion which were
not shown as assets in, reflected in or taken into account in, or in
computing a provision for Tax in, the Net Working Capital Amount including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any interest or repayment supplements (less any
Tax due, or which would have been due, but for the availability of any
Purchasers Relief). For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph 9 shall not
apply to any refund of Tax received in respect of any amount on account of Tax
required by Law to be deducted or withheld from any payments made under this
Agreement. The Purchaser shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure that
the Group Companies obtain, on a timely basis, all refunds of Tax to which
this paragraph 9 could apply. 
---|--- 
 



   9.2 | Within twenty (20) Business Days of the later of (i) two (2)
years following the Completion Date, and (ii) payment of the balance standing
to the credit of the Warranty Escrow Account to the Vendor in accordance with
Clause 9.2(b), the Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor an amount equal to the
Tax Refund less the sum of any amounts in respect of which the Purchaser would
have been able to claim payment under paragraph 1.1 of this Schedule 9 ( _Tax
Covenant_ ) or for breach of any of the Tax Warranties, in each case, but for
paragraph 1.2 of Schedule 8 (other than any amounts already taken into account
under paragraph 6 of this Schedule 9) . 
---|--- 



   9.3 | If any Group Company or the Purchaser discovers that there has
been a refund of Tax, the Purchaser shall, or shall procure that the Group
Company concerned shall, as soon as reasonably practicable give sufficient
details in writing of the refund of Tax to the Vendor and the Purchaser shall,
or shall procure that the Group Company concerned shall, supply to the Vendor
such information as it may reasonably request in writing to verify the amount
of the refund of Tax. 
---|--- 



   9.4 | This paragraph 9 does not apply to the extent that: (i) the
refund of Tax is attributable to a Purchasers Relief; (ii) the refund of Tax
has been taken into account under paragraph 2.10; (iii) the refund of Tax
arises in circumstances to which paragraph 6.1 applies; (iv) the recipient of
the refund is obliged to pay an amount in respect of the refund to a person
other than a Group Company or a member of the Purchasers Tax Group; or (v)
the refund of Tax is an income Tax refund received by any Group Company
following the Completion Date from the Maltese Inland Revenue Department
pursuant to Article 48 of the Maltese Income Tax Management Act with respect
to or as a result of profits distributed or capitalised by any Group Company
organised under the Laws of Malta. 
---|--- 
 





 

168 ---|--- 



   10.1 | If, within 180 days following Completion, in the event that any
Entity Election Form (as defined in the Pre-Completion Restructuring Paper)
that had been prepared and filed pursuant to the Pre-Completion Restructuring
is, in the Purchasers reasonable judgment, determined to be ineffective,
then: (i) the Purchaser shall, at its cost and option, prepare and deliver to
the Vendor a revised or updated and fully and accurately completed Entity
Election Form or consent thereto in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3 (a "Revised Election Form"), along with an explanation of
any changes to the original Entity Election Form; (ii) within ten (10) days
of the Vendors receipt of any such Revised Election Form, the Vendor shall
deliver or cause to be delivered a validly signed and duly executed original
copy of such Revised Election Form; and (iii) the Purchaser shall file such
Revised Election Form with the IRS no later than ten (10) days following the
Purchasers receipt of the validly signed and duly executed original copy of
such Revised Election Form.  
---|--- 



   10.2 | If prior to Completion, the Purchaser has not filed an Entity
Election Form with respect to any Group Company for which the Purchaser was
entitled to file an Entity Election Form pursuant to the Pre-Completion
Restructuring, then with respect to APH4, Actavis Pharma Holding 5 ehf.,
Actavis Eignarhaldsfelag ehf., AGH and/or Actavis Group PTC ehf (each in
Purchasers sole discretion), and with respect to any other Group Company
which is an "eligible entity" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3(a)) as of the intended effective date of the election
(subject to the Vendors written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), upon the Purchasers written request and at the Purchasers cost,
the Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Vendor with
respect to such Group Company complete and accurate Entity Election Forms,
providing for a retroactive U.S. federal income tax classification for such
Group Company, effective as of a date on or before three (3) days before
Completion. The Vendor shall, at the Purchasers cost, furnish or cause to be
furnished, to the Purchaser, upon written request, as promptly as practicable,
such information and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the Purchasers
preparation of any such Entity Election Forms. Within ten (10) days of
its receipt of any such Entity Election Forms, the Vendor shall at the
Purchasers cost cause such forms to be validly signed and duly executed and
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser each such signed and
executed Entity Election Form. As soon as practicable following its receipt
of such signed and executed Entity Election Forms, the Purchaser shall file
each such Entity Election Form with the IRS. 
---|--- 
 



   10.3 | The Purchaser will indemnify the Vendor on demand for any losses
suffered or incurred as a result of any action taken pursuant to this
paragraph 10.  
---|--- 



   11. | COVENANTS IN RELATION TO WITHHOLDINGS 
---|--- 



   11.1 | The Vendor covenants with the Purchaser to pay the Purchaser an
amount equal to 50% of any liability for Tax actually payable by the Purchaser
(or which would have been payable but for the use of a Purchasers Relief)
arising: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | in respect of any deduction or withholding required by Law
to be made from any payment (other than interest) made by the Purchaser
pursuant to Clauses 3 or 4.7, but only to the extent that the deduction or
withholding was not made at the time of such payment; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

subject to the Purchaser having obtained the West Luxembourg Ruling and having
complied fully with the terms of such ruling, in respect of any Tax payable
by the Purchaser (or which would have been payable but for the use of a
Purchasers Relief) on any payment (other than interest) received by the
Purchaser under

169 ), 10 ( _Interim Covenant Escrow Account_ ) or 11 ( _Indemnity_ ), or
paragraph 4 ( _Payment of Claims_ ) or Schedule 12 ( _Contingent
Consideration_ ). 
---|--- 



   11.2 | The Purchaser covenants with the Vendor to pay to the Vendor an
amount equal to 50% of any liability of the Vendor to make an actual payment
of Tax arising in respect of any deduction or withholding required by Law to
be made from any payment (other than interest) made to the Purchaser pursuant
to Clause 3 ( _Consideration_ ), 9 ( _Warranty Escrow Account_ ), 10 (
_Interim Covenant Escrow Account_ ), or 11 ( _Indemnity_ ), paragraph 4 (
_Payment of Claims_ ) or Schedule 12 ( _Contingent Consideration_ ) but only
to the extent that the deduction or withholding was not made at the time of
such payment.  
---|--- 



   11.3 | Paragraph 3 ( _Manner of Making and Conduct of Claims_ ) will
apply to the covenants contained in paragraphs 11.1 and 11.2 as it applies to
the covenants contained in paragraph 1.1, replacing references to the
"Vendor" by the "Purchaser" (and the other way round, as the case may be)
where appropriate, and making any other necessary modifications. 
---|--- 
 



   11.4 | The limitation set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 8 (
_Limitations on Liability_ ) shall not apply to the covenants contained in

Guarantor, under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter; _provided
that_ the Purchaser Guarantor is not making any representation or warranty
regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the Signing Warranties or the
Completion Warranties. 
---|--- 
 





 

200 does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to funding the
full amount of the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to the Purchaser Guarantor on the date of
Completion; _provided that_ the Purchaser Guarantor is not making any
representation regarding the accuracy of the Signing Warranties or the
Completion Warranties, or compliance by the Vendor with its obligations
hereunder. The Debt Commitment Letter provided to the Vendor contains all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
the Debt Financing available to the Purchaser Guarantor on the terms therein.
There are no other agreements, contracts or arrangements, whether written or
oral, related to the Debt Financing that add any additional conditions to, or
affect the availability or amount of, the Debt Financing on the Completion
Date.

   7. | ANTI-TRUST 
---|--- 

The Budgeted Gross Margin information for certain products provided by the
Purchaser or its Representatives to the Vendor, the Group, or their respective
Representatives was prepared by the Purchaser Guarantor in a reasonable manner
and using reasonable assumptions and that, so far as the Purchaser Guarantor
is aware, it does not omit any matter that would make such Budgeted Gross
Margin misleading in any material respect.
