following meanings when used in this Agreement:

 

1.2.1. " _Accounting Principles_ " means accounting principles, procedures,
estimation methodologies and methods that are (a) in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied, and (b) the same as those used in the preparation of the
Rave Financial Statements and the Working Capital Calculation Schedule;
_provided_ , _however,_ that in the event of any conflict between GAAP or the
accounting principles, procedures, estimation methodologies and methods used
in the preparation of the Rave Financial Statements, on the one hand, and the
accounting principles, procedures, estimation methodologies and methods used
in the preparation of the Working Capital Calculation Schedule, on the other
hand, the accounting principles, procedures, estimation methodologies and
methods used in the preparation of the Working Capital Calculation Schedule
shall govern for purposes of determining Net Working Capital.

1.2.2. " _Acquired Lease Guaranty_ " means any guaranty provided by Rave or
any of its Affiliates with respect to the obligations of a tenant, subtenant,
lessee or sublessee under any Acquired Lease.

 

1.2.3. " _Action_ " means any action, suit, litigation, arbitration or other
similar legal proceeding (whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise,
whether at law or in equity, and whether civil or criminal) that is brought,
conducted or heard before any Governmental Authority.

 



3 1.2.4. " _Affiliate_ " means, as to any specified Person, each other Person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control
with the specified Person. For purposes of this definition, the term "control"
(including the terms "controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control
with") means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether
through ownership of voting securities or by contract. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Manager and its Affiliates are not Affiliates of Rave or the
Acquired Companies for purposes of this Agreement.

1.2.5. " _Assignment and Assumption Agreement_ " means an assignment and
assumption agreement in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and duly
executed by Rave and the Company, effecting the Acquired Business
Contribution.

1.2.6. " _Business Day_ " means any day, except any Saturday, Sunday or any
other day on which banking institutions in New York, New York, Boston,

1.2.8. " _Closing Debt Amount_ " means the amount of Debt of the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date (determined in accordance with GAAP and
including any interest, fees, penalties or premiums accruing on the Closing
Date but calculated after giving effect to the repayment under Section 2.5.1
of all Liabilities of the Acquired Companies in respect of the Debt
outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of the Closing Date). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Total Acquisition Consideration shall not be reduced
by the amount of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement but the payment to
Rave under Section 2.5.4 shall be reduced to take into account the repayment
by Buyer on behalf of Rave and its Subsidiaries of Credit Agreement Debt under
Section 2.5.1.

 

1.2.9. " _Code_ " means the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

Rave or of any Subsidiary of Rave has any relation by blood, marriage or
adoption (a " _Family Member_ "), (c) any business entity in which any of the
Persons described in the immediately preceding clauses (a) and (b) owns any
beneficial interest (other than a publicly held corporation whose stock is
traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market
and less than 1% of the stock of which is beneficially owned by all such
directors, members, managers, officers, employees and Persons in the
aggregate), or (d) any Affiliate of Rave or of any director, member, manager,
officer or employee of Rave or of any Subsidiary of Rave or, if any of the
foregoing is a natural person, any of his or her Family Members.

 



4 1.2.11. " _Contractual Obligation_ " means, with respect to any Person, any
written or oral contract, agreement, deed, mortgage, lease, sublease, license,

such Person is legally bound.

1.2.12. " _Credit Agreement_ " means the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated as of December 18, 2009, among Rave, as borrower, the
other credit parties signatory thereto, as credit parties, General Electric
Capital Corporation, as administrative agent, and the lenders and other agents
from time to time party thereto as amended by the Extension and Amendment to
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of December 8, 2010 and the
Extension and Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
as of December 13, 2011, as the same may be further amended or otherwise
modified from time to time.

1.2.13. " _Debt_ " means, with respect to the Acquired Companies, without

obligations, and all conditional sale obligations, (c) under any interest
rate, currency or other hedging agreements, to the extent payable if
terminated at the Closing, or (d) with respect to due and payable
reimbursement obligations under stand-by letters of credit and other similar
instruments. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed
that (i) outstanding obligations under undrawn stand-by letters of credit and
other similar instruments and (ii) the capitalized liability under GAAP
of any capital leases of the Acquired Companies (and any other liabilities
relating to lease obligations of the Acquired Companies that are required by
GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet of the Acquired Companies) shall not
constitute "Debt" for purposes of this Agreement.

1.2.14. " _Environmental Laws_ " means all Legal Requirements as of the date
hereof of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Acquired
Companies or the properties upon which the Acquired Business is conducted
addressing pollution or the protection of human health or the environment,

Statement. At all times after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement

and its advisors a reasonable opportunity to review, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice, Raves and the Acquired
Subsidiaries books and records and the working papers related to the
preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement (including the determinations
included therein), and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Buyer and its representatives and advisors reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to knowledgeable employees
of the Manager who provide management and accounting services to Rave and its
Subsidiaries in order to facilitate Buyers and its representatives and
advisors review of the Estimated Closing Statement. Rave shall make all
appropriate revisions, if any, to the Estimated Closing Statement as are
reasonably and mutually agreed upon by Rave and Buyer.

 



13 2.6.2. _Closing Statement_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer will, at Buyers sole cost and expense, prepare or cause to be prepared,
and will provide to Rave, a written statement setting forth in reasonable
detail and with supporting calculations, Buyers proposed final determination
of the Total Acquisition Consideration, the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing
Debt Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount (the " _Proposed Final Closing Statement_ "). The Proposed
Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and this Agreement. Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Companies) and their respective employees and accountants shall
assist Rave and its accountants and other representatives in Raves review of
the Proposed Final Closing Statement. For purposes of such review, Buyer and
its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) shall provide Rave and its
accountants and other representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to knowledgeable employees
and accounting professionals of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Companies) in order to facilitate Raves and its representatives
and advisors review of the Proposed Final Closing Statement.

 

2.6.3. _Dispute Notice_. The Proposed Final Closing Statement will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties unless Rave provides a written notice
(a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer no later than the sixtieth (60th) day after
delivery of the Proposed Final Closing Statement setting forth in reasonable
detail (a) any item on the Proposed Final Closing Statement which Rave
disputes or otherwise believes has not been prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles or this Agreement and (b) the alternative amount
calculated by Rave with respect to such item in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and this Agreement. Any item or amount to which no
dispute is raised in a Dispute Notice timely delivered will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties as of the end of such sixtieth (60th)
day. 

2.6.4. _Resolution of Disputes_. Buyer and Rave will attempt to resolve any
matters raised in a Dispute Notice in good faith. Beginning on the twentieth
(20th) Business Day after delivery of the Dispute Notice, either Buyer or Rave
may provide written notice to the other that it elects to submit the disputed
items to McGladrey LLP or another nationally recognized independent
accounting firm chosen by mutual agreement of Rave and Buyer (the "
_Arbitrator_ "). The Arbitrator will promptly, in accordance with the rules
set forth in the Arbitrators engagement letter and its customary practices,
review only those items and amounts objected to in the Dispute Notice and
resolve all such disputed items in accordance with this Agreement, the
Accounting Principles and the written presentations made by Buyer and Rave
and their respective representatives and advisors, and not by independent
review. In any such case, a single partner of the Arbitrator selected by the
Arbitrator in accordance with its normal procedures and having expertise with
respect to settlement of such disputes and the industry in which the Acquired
Business operates shall act for the Arbitrator in the determination
proceeding, and such partner shall render a written decision with respect to
such dispute, including a statement in reasonable detail of the basis for its
decision. The decision of the Arbitrator with respect to the disputed items of
the Proposed Final Closing Statement submitted to it will be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties, effective as of the date the Arbitrators written
decision is received by Buyer and Rave. Each of the parties to this Agreement
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the

 



14  Arbitrator (including by executing a customary engagement letter reasonably
acceptable to the Arbitrator and the parties) and to cause the Arbitrator to
resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable after the commencement of the
Arbitrators engagement. The costs and fees related to such determination by
the Arbitrator, including the costs relating to any negotiations with the
Arbitrator with respect to the terms and conditions of the Arbitrators
engagement, will be paid by Buyer and Rave on an inversely proportional basis,
based upon the relative portions of the amounts in dispute that have been
submitted to the Arbitrator for resolution that ultimately are awarded to
each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Rave, on the other hand. For example, if
$100,000 is in dispute, and of that amount the Arbitrator awards $75,000 to
Buyer and $25,000 to Rave, then Buyer will be responsible for 25%, and Rave
75%, of the costs and fees of the Arbitrator. Buyer and Rave shall each pay
their own fees and expenses related to such determination, and each of Buyer
and Rave will bear their own legal, accounting and other fees and expenses of
participating in such dispute resolution procedure. For purposes of clarity,
the "Final Closing Statement" shall mean (i) if a Dispute Notice is not
delivered by Rave within the period provided in Section 2.6.3, the Proposed
Final Closing Statement as prepared by Buyer or (ii) if such a Dispute Notice
is delivered by Rave, either (x) if the matters raised in the Dispute Notice
are resolved by agreement of the parties, the Proposed Final Closing Statement
with such adjustments as agreed to in writing by Buyer and Rave or (y) if the
matters raised in the Dispute Notice are resolved by the Arbitrator in
accordance with Section 2.6.4, the Proposed Final Closing Statement with such
adjustments as determined by the Arbitrator in accordance with Section 2.6.4.

2.6.5. _Adjustment Payment_. Promptly, and in any event no later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day after the determination of the Final Closing
Statement in accordance with this Section 2.6:

2.6.5.1. If the Total Acquisition Consideration, as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.6 exceeds the estimated Total Acquisition
Consideration reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement and used for
purposes of the Closing Date payments pursuant to Section 2.5, then Buyer will
pay an amount equal to such excess by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to Rave; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such amount
exceed $5,000,000.

2.6.5.2. If the estimated Total Acquisition Consideration reflected on the
Estimated Closing Statement and used for purposes of the Closing Date
payments pursuant to Section 2.5 exceeds the Total Acquisition Consideration,
as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.6, then Rave and Buyer shall
jointly direct the Escrow Agent to disburse by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by Buyer an amount equal to the lesser
of such excess and the amount of the Escrow Funds. Buyer shall be entitled to
payments under this Section 2.6.5.2 solely out of the Escrow Funds, and in no
event shall Buyer be entitled to an amount in excess of the aggregate amount
in the Escrow Funds.

 



15 The parties will treat any payment received pursuant to Section 2.6.5.1
or Section 2.6.5.2 as an adjustment to purchase price for Tax and financial
reporting purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

2.7. _Escrow_. At Closing, (a) Buyer and Rave shall enter into (and cause the
Escrow Agent to enter into) the Escrow Agreement and (b) Buyer will deposit
the Escrow Amount in escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Amount shall be held and, subject to Sections 2.6 and 9, released to
Rave in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.

 

2.8. _Tax Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, and to
cause the Escrow Agent to deduct and withhold, from the amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Section 2 or the Escrow Agreement to Rave such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of
applicable Tax law, and Buyer and Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall be
responsible for making any required filings with and payments to a Taxing
Authority relating to any such deduction or withholding. Buyer shall notify
Rave, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, of any
amounts they believe are required to be deducted and withheld in respect of
the Contemplated Transactions. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to, or for the benefit of, Rave.

respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all consents from

Company and Buyer.

respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, an estoppel certificate
executed by the landlord under each of the Acquired Leases set forth on

required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any Liability in
favor of) any landlord or lessor from whom any such estoppels certificate may
be requested without the prior written consent of the Company and Buyer. 

5.3.4. Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, a Landlord Release for
each Acquired Theater set forth on _Schedule 5.3.4_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the parties shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to

expressly provided in Section 6.7, obtaining the consents, estoppel
certificates and leasehold title insurance policies contemplated by Sections
5.3.2, 5.3.3 and 5.3.5 shall not be a condition to Closing and the parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent the efforts contemplated
by Sections 5.3.2, 5.3.3 and 5.3.5 in respect of matters that are not
conditions to Closing under Section 6 from interfering with or delaying the
Closing.

 



33 5.3.7. Rave is party to Contractual Obligations with vendors that relate
to both the Acquired Theaters and other theaters, including those owned by
Rave and its Subsidiaries and managed by the Manager (" _Multi-Site Contracts_
"). Prior to the Closing, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain from, and to cooperate in obtaining from, and shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, enter into
with, each vendor party to a Multi-Site Contract, either (a) separate
contracts (" _New Vendor Contracts_ ") that allocate the rights and
obligations of Rave under the Multi-Site Contracts as between the Acquired
Theaters, on the one hand, and the other theaters owned by Rave or its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, and which are otherwise substantially similar
in all material respects to the Multi-Site Contracts or (b) agreements
effective as of the Closing (" _Partial Assignments and Releases_ ") that (i)
assign the rights and obligations related to the Acquired Theaters and the
Acquired Business (whether arising before or after the Closing) to Buyer or

Partial Assignments and Releases as between the Acquired Theaters, on the one
hand, and the other theaters owned by Rave and its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, in an equitable manner that is mutually and reasonably agreed to by Rave
and Buyer. In connection with the entering into of New Acquired Theater
Contracts, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that Rave
is released by the vendor from Liabilities relating to the Acquired Theaters
and Acquired Business and that the Company shall not incur Liabilities
relating to the theaters owned by Rave and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Acquired Theaters). In the event that any such vendors do not agree to enter
into New Acquired Theater Contracts or Partial Assignments and Releases
consistent with this Section 5.3.7, the parties shall in good faith seek
mutually acceptable alternative arrangements for purposes of allocating
rights and Liabilities under the Multi-Site Contracts (" _Acceptable
Alternative Arrangements_ ").

5.4. _Business Records_. Buyer acknowledges that Rave may from time to time
from and after the Closing Date, at the sole expense of Rave, require access
to copies of certain of the Records, and agrees that upon reasonable prior
notice Buyer will, and will ensure that the Acquired Companies will, during
normal business hours, provide Rave with access to or, if requested by Rave,
copies of such Records.

 

5.5. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

5.5.1. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liability for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing now existing
in favor of the current or

 



34 former members, directors, officers, managers, employees and other agents of
the Acquired Companies, including as provided in the Organizational Documents
of the Acquired Companies, will survive the Closing and will continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Closing Date.

5.5.2. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each Person that
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior
to the Closing, a member, director, officer, manager, employee or other agent
of any Acquired Company, against any and all Losses arising out of or
relating to any threatened or actual Action based in whole or in part on or
arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact that such Person is
or was a member, director, officer, manager, employee or other agent of an
Acquired Company on or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, or at or after, the Closing Date, including each Action
described on _Schedule 3.10_ , in each case, to the fullest extent a
corporation or limited liability company is permitted under applicable law to
indemnify such Persons, and Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
such Action to each such indemnified Person. Without limiting the foregoing,
from and after the Closing Date, in the event any such Action is brought
against any such indemnified Person (whether arising before or after the
Closing Date), (i) each such indemnified Person may retain counsel
satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for such indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefore
are received, and (ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
use reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such
matter. The parties hereto agree that all rights to
indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to advances of
expenses incurred in defense of any such Action existing in favor of the
current or former members, directors, officers, managers, employees or other
agents of the Acquired Companies with respect to matters occurring through
the Closing Date shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification hereunder asserted or made
within such period will continue until the disposition of such indemnified
Actions.

 

5.5.3. If Buyer or any Acquired Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (a) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer or such Acquired Company, as applicable, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5. 

5.5.4. This Section 5.5 shall be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the current or former members, directors, officers, managers, employees
and other agents of the Acquired Companies, and their respective heirs and
estate, all of whom shall be express third party beneficiaries hereof.

 



35 5.6. _Tax Matters_.

 

5.6.1. _Tax Treatment of Contemplated Transactions_. Buyer, the Acquired
Companies, Rave, and their respective Affiliates agree that the Contemplated
Transactions are intended to be treated for federal and applicable state
income Tax purposes as a purchase of the underlying assets of the Acquired
Subsidiaries and of the Acquired Assets (excluding the membership interests
in the Acquired Companies) by Buyer from Rave and will file all Tax Returns
consistent with such treatment and not take any position or action
inconsistent with such treatment.

 

5.6.2. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Prior to but no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Rave and Buyer shall use their
reasonable best efforts to agree upon and prepare an allocation schedule
outlining the principles by which the purchase price (as determined for Tax
purposes) shall be allocated among the underlying assets of the Acquired
Companies (any such agreed upon schedule, the " _Purchase Price Allocation
Principles_ "). Buyer, the Acquired Companies, Rave and their respective
Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation Principles as set forth in such agreed upon
schedule. If Buyer and Rave cannot agree on the Purchase Price Allocation
Principles upon which to base the allocation of the purchase price (as
determined for Tax purposes), then Buyer, the Acquired Companies, Rave and
their respective Affiliates shall each be entitled to file their respective
Tax Returns based on their own determination of allocation of the purchase
price (as determined for Tax purposes).

 

5.6.3. _Pre-Closing and Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed
for the Acquired Companies related to a Straddle Period or to a Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date that is due after the Closing Date. Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with past practice to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and with the Purchase Price
Allocation Principles, if any. The parties further agree that, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any bonuses or other
compensation paid or accrued in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, and any Seller Transaction Expenses, shall be reported on the
Tax Returns of Rave and, if applicable, the Acquired Companies for Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall provide all Tax Returns
referred to in the first sentence above together with a statement setting
forth the amount of Tax that is allocated to a Tax period or a portion of a
Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Tax Statement_ ") to
Rave at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns and shall incorporate any comments reasonably requested by Rave on
such Tax Returns or Tax Statements prior to filing. If Buyer and Rave are
unable to agree on any comments requested by Rave, the disputed issues shall
be submitted to a nationally recognized accounting firm agreeable to Buyer and
Rave for final resolution in a manner consistent with Section 2.6.4 and the
Purchase Price Allocation Principles, if any. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not, and Buyer shall not permit any of the forgoing to, amend, refile or
modify any Tax Return described in this Section 5.6.3 or any Tax Return of an
Acquired Company that was filed prior to the Closing Date.

 



36 5.6.4. _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. In the case of Taxes of the Acquired
Companies that are payable with respect to any Taxable period that begins on
or before, and ends after, the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall include the following: (A)
in the case of any Taxes imposed in respect of property of the Acquired
Companies (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any income Tax) and that
applies ratably to a Straddle Period, the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, (B) in the case
of sales, withholding and similar transactions-based Taxes (other than any
Taxes allocated under Section 5.6.6), the amount of such Tax arising from
transactions of the Acquired Companies that occurred prior to the Closing,
and (C) in the case of any Taxes based upon or measured by income, gain or
receipts of the Acquired Companies, the amount of such Tax which would be
payable if the relevant Taxable period actually ended on the Closing
Date based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on
the Closing Date but without taking into account any Taxes described in
Section 5.6.7. For purposes of this Section 5.6.4, any deductions attributable
to bonuses or other compensation paid or accrued in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, and any Seller Transaction Expenses, shall be
treated as allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with applicable Legal
Requirements and otherwise with prior practices of the Acquired Companies. Any
credit or refund with respect to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date based upon similar
principles to those described in this Section 5.6.4.

 

5.6.5. _Pre-Closing Tax Refunds or Credits_. Any Tax refunds, credits,
overpayments and prepayments of Tax made prior to the Closing Date (in each
case including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) of, or with
respect to, any of the Acquired Companies that are attributable or allocable
to any Tax period (or portion thereof) of the relevant Acquired Company
ending on or before the Closing Date will be for the account of Rave. Buyer
will promptly inform Rave of any refunds, credits or amounts to which Rave may
be entitled hereunder and, if Rave so requests and at Raves expense, cause
the relevant entity to file for and obtain any such refunds, credits or
amounts, including through the prosecution of any proceeding (including
against a Taxing Authority) which Rave chooses to direct such entity to
pursue. Buyer will permit Rave to control (at Raves expense and sole
discretion) the prosecution and content of any such claim or proceeding
(including, but not limited to, any position to be taken on such claim or in
such proceeding); _provided_ , that for any such claim submitted to a Taxing
Authority, (i) the resolution of which by the Taxing Authority would adversely
affect the Tax treatment of any asset of the Acquired Companies in the hands
of Buyer in a manner that materially increases Taxes of an Acquired Company
or Buyer and (ii) with respect to which the parties disagree as to the tax
positions to be taken in such refund or credit claim, then a mutually agreed
upon nationally recognized accounting firm shall determine whether Raves or
Buyers position is stronger, and the stronger position (as so determined)
shall be maintained in any such claim or proceeding. Any amounts to which Rave
is entitled under this Section 5.6.5 will be paid by Buyer (or an Affiliate
of Buyer) to Rave.

 



37 5.6.6. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
shall be allocated and borne equally between Buyer and Rave (provided that
the sole source of payment with respect to such Taxes allocated to Rave shall
be the Escrow Funds).

5.6.7. _Closing Date Ordinary Course of Business_. Buyer shall not cause or
permit any Acquired Company to take any actions out of the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date after the Closing (and shall not report any
income or gain attributable to any such actions on any Tax Return of any
Acquired Company for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date unless required
by Legal Requirement to do so). Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Persons for any Losses or Taxes attributable to or relating
to any such actions that are outside of the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date.

 

5.6.8. _Tax Proceedings_. Buyer and its Affiliates will promptly (and in any
event, within ten (10) days) notify Rave in writing upon receipt by any of
the foregoing of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits, examinations, or
similar events with respect to Tax Returns or Taxes of the Acquired Companies
for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect to
Taxes for which Rave could be liable under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or otherwise (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar
event, a " _Tax Matter_ "). Rave shall be entitled to control the defense of
any such Tax Matter that relates to any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Matter_ ") before any Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for any
Pre-Closing Tax Matter the resolution of which by any Governmental Authority
would adversely affect either Buyer or any Acquired Company, Buyer shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter.
With respect to any Tax Matter other than a Pre-Closing Tax Matter, Buyer and
Rave shall be entitled to jointly control the defense.

5.6.8.1. If Rave assumes and controls the defense of any Pre-Closing Tax
Matter, Buyer shall cooperate with Rave in pursuing such Pre-Closing Tax
Matter and Rave shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Pre-Closing Tax Matter, including,
without limitation, promptly forwarding to Buyer all correspondence related to
such Pre-Closing Tax Matter; _provided_ that if a proposed settlement
or compromise of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter would adversely affect either
Buyer or any Acquired Company, then Rave shall not enter into such settlement
or compromise of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter without the prior written consent
of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed).

 



38 5.6.8.2. If Rave does not elect to control or does not control the defense of
any Pre-Closing Tax Matter or if an other Tax Matter is not jointly
controlled, Buyer will control the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter or
other Tax Matter but shall keep Rave informed of the progress of such Pre-
Closing Tax Matter or other Tax Matter, as applicable, including, without
limitation, promptly forwarding to Rave all correspondence related to such
Pre-Closing Tax Matter or other Tax Matter. None of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates may enter into any settlement or compromise of any Pre-Closing Tax
Matter or other Tax Matter, without the prior written consent of Rave (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

5.6.8.3. In the case of any Tax Matter jointly controlled by the parties, each
party shall (i) promptly provide the other party with a copy of all documents
relating to such Tax Matter, (ii) jointly prepare any written submissions in
connection with such audit, examination or proceeding, (iii) jointly attend
any conference with any Governmental Authority regarding such audit,
examination or proceeding and (iv) not settle or compromise any such audit,
examination or proceeding without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

5.6.8.4. Any Third Party Claims relating to Taxes shall be governed solely by
this Section 5.6.8 and not by Section 9.2.4.

5.6.9. _Payment of Taxes_. To the extent the amount of the Taxes of the
Acquired Companies shown on a Tax Return prepared pursuant to Section 5.6.3
(as prepared and filed in accordance with that Section) for any Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date or for the portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (determined under the principles set forth in
Section 5.6.4) exceeds the sum of the amount of such Taxes that was taken into
account in the calculation of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount as
finally determined and the amount of such Taxes that was paid prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer and Rave shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release
funds from the escrow account maintained under the Escrow Agreement, to the
extent available, equal to such excess (but in all cases, determined in
accordance with this Agreement and limited to the amount for which Buyer is
entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement), or alternatively Buyer may
file a claim against the Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 9.2.1.

 

5.7. _Notice of Developments; Update of Schedules_. From the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1, Rave and the Company shall (prior to the Closing)
notify Buyer in writing upon Rave or the Company becoming aware: (a) that any
representation or warranty made by Rave or the Company in this Agreement was
when made, or has subsequently become, untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (b) of the failure of Rave or the Company to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Rave
or the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Rave and the Company will have the
right from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend the
Schedules with respect to any events or conditions (other than events or
conditions caused by Raves or the Companys breach of this Agreement) that
arise after the date hereof and prior to the Closing in the ordinary course of
business and that, in all material

 



39  respects, are consistent with the past practices and experiences of the
Acquired Businesses and which if existing at the date of this Agreement would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Schedules; _provided_
, _however_ , that no Action involving potential payments by or to Rave or any
of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its subsidiaries or the Acquired Subsidiaries
of more than $75,000 shall be deemed to be an event or condition that has
arisen in the ordinary course of business. Any such supplement or amendment
shall have no effect for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the
conditions to closing set forth in Section 6; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, such supplemental or amended Schedules shall be
taken into account (and shall amend the Schedules effective as of the Closing
Date) for purposes of determining whether any person is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to Section 9 (and the amount of Losses subject
hereto).

5.8. _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or the
earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, Rave
shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its representatives to, and
Rave shall cause its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries representatives not
to, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate, or encourage (including by
way of furnishing non-public information or assistance) the submission of any
proposal or offer from any Person relating to, or enter into or consummate
any transaction relating to, the acquisition of any membership interests in
the Acquired Companies or any merger, recapitalization, share exchange, sale
of assets involving the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Theaters or the
Acquired Business (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of
business) or any similar transaction or any other alternative to the
transactions contemplated hereby or (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or
participate in, or facilitate in any other manner, any effort or attempt by
any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Rave shall notify Buyer orally
(within one (1) Business Day) and in writing (as promptly as practicable, and
in any event no later than three (3) Business Days) of all relevant terms of
any inquiry or proposal by a third party to do any of the foregoing that Rave
or any Subsidiary of Rave or any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective officers, directors, partners, managers, employees,
consultants, Affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors or representatives may receive relating to any of such matters. If
the inquiry or proposal is in writing, Rave shall deliver to Buyer a copy of
such inquiry or proposal together with such written notice. Buyer hereby
acknowledges that Rave and its Subsidiaries have been and will continue to
be participating in discussions and negotiations regarding a sale of its
business (other than the Acquired Business, the Acquired Companies and the
Acquired Theatres) and any such discussions or negotiations regarding such
transaction shall not violate this Section 5.8.

5.9. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Recognizing that Ropes and
Gray LLP has acted as legal counsel to Rave and its Affiliates and may be
deemed to have acted as legal counsel to the Acquired Companies prior to the
Closing, and that Ropes and Gray LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Rave and
its Affiliates after the Closing, the Company hereby waives (and Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees to such waiver), on its own behalf and on behalf of
its current and future Subsidiaries, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with Ropes and Gray LLP representing Rave and its Affiliates after
the Closing in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Buyer hereby agrees that, in the
event a dispute arises after the Closing in connection with this Agreement,
the Escrow

 



40  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby between Buyer
and/or any of the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Rave and/or its
Affiliates, on the other hand, Ropes and Gray LLP may represent Rave and/or its
Affiliates in such dispute (including in any Action arising therefrom) even
though the interests of Rave may be directly adverse to Buyer and/or any of
the Acquired Companies, and even though Ropes and Gray LLP may have represented
one or more of the Acquired Companies in a matter substantially related to
such dispute. Buyer and the Company further agree that, as to all
communications between Ropes and Gray LLP, any of the Acquired Companies and
Rave that relate in any way to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Rave and may
be controlled by Rave, and shall not pass to or be claimed or controlled by
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event a dispute arises between Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies and a
party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, any of the
Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Ropes and Gray LLP to such third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Acquired Companies may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of Rave.

Losses), from, against and in respect of any and all Losses, incurred or
suffered by such Buyer Indemnified Persons as a result of:

  



45 9.2.1.1. any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made

all Losses, incurred or suffered by such Seller Indemnified Persons as a
result of:

 

9.2.2.1. any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made
by Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement; 

9.2.2.2. any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement of Buyer

the Closing Date that are not attributable to periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date; or

 



46 9.2.2.4. the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the operation of the
Acquired Business or Acquired Assets following the Closing.

9.2.3. _Limitations on Liability_.

 

9.2.3.1. Neither the Buyer Indemnified Persons (in respect of Section 9.2.1)
nor the Seller Indemnified Persons (in respect of Section 9.2.2) shall be
entitled to assert any claim for indemnification hereunder until such time as
the aggregate of all Losses that such Buyer Indemnified Persons or such Seller
Indemnified Persons may have under said Section exceed $500,000 (the "
_Threshold_ "), in which case the Buyer Indemnified Persons or the Seller
Indemnified Persons, as applicable, may claim indemnification for the full
amount of such Losses; _provided_ that the Threshold shall not apply to any
claim (a) under Sections 9.2.1.1 (with respect to any claims for a breach of a
Fundamental

 

Representation), 9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.3, 9.2.1.4, 9.2.1.5, 9.2.1.6, 9.2.2.1 (with
respect to any claims for a breach of a Fundamental Representation), 9.2.2.2,
9.2.2.3, or 9.2.2.4 or (b) common law fraud based on the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3 or 4. As used herein, " _Fundamental
Representation_ " means the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.1 (Organization, Power, Standing and Authority), 3.2 (Validity of
Agreement), 3.5 (Capitalization and Subsidiaries), 3.15 (Tax Matters), 3.21
(Brokers), 4.1 (Organization, Power; Validity of Agreement), and
4.6 (Brokers).

9.2.3.2. The aggregate liability for indemnification claims under Section
9.2.1 will be limited to $2,250,000 and shall be payable only from the Escrow
Funds from time to time held in the escrow account maintained under the Escrow
Agreement.

9.2.3.3. The amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under
Section 9.2.1 shall be calculated net of any amounts claimed against the
Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 5.6.9. The amount of Losses for which
indemnification is available under this Section 9 shall be calculated net of
any amounts actually recovered by the Person entitled to seek indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnified Person_ ") under insurance policies or
otherwise from third parties with respect to such Losses. In the event that
any party required to provide indemnification under this Section 9 (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") makes any payment hereunder in respect of any Losses,
such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment to
the rights of such Indemnified Person against any insurer or other third
Person with respect to such Losses (and the Indemnified Persons shall
not take any actions to adversely affect such subrogation rights without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party). In addition, the amount of Losses for
which indemnification is available under this Section 9 shall be (i) in the
case of claims under Section 9.2.1, calculated net of all amounts reflected
in the Closing Debt Amount, the Seller Transaction Expenses or the Net

 



47  Working Capital Adjustment Amount, as applicable, and (ii) in the case of
any claims under Section 9.2.1 or 9.2.2, reduced to take account of any net
Tax benefit reasonably expected to be realized by such Indemnified Person or
any Affiliate arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss (or from
a correlative adjustment).

9.2.3.4. _Limitations on Tax Indemnification_. A Buyer Indemnified Person
shall not be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification under Section
9.2.1 with respect to (A) Taxes attributable to actions taken by Buyer on the
Closing Date after the Closing and Taxes attributable to actions taken by the
Acquired Companies on the Closing Date after the Closing that are not in the
ordinary course of business; (B) the portion of the Transfer Taxes which are
the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to Section 5.6.6; (C) Taxes of or
allocable to any Taxable period beginning after the Closing Date or the post-
Closing portion of any Straddle Period (determined based on the principles
set forth in Section 5.6.4); or (D) the amount of, expiration date with
respect to, availability of or limitations on any Tax attributes or Tax
assets. For the avoidance of doubt, a Buyer Indemnified Person shall not be
entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2.1 with respect to any Taxes that
are disputed in good faith until such time as that dispute is finally
resolved.

 

9.2.3.5. No party will in any event be liable under this Section 9, and no
claim for indemnification may in any event be asserted under this Section 9,
for any loss of, or based on any multiple of, profits or earnings, diminution
in value or incidental, punitive, indirect, special or consequential damages
by reason of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or indemnity
contained herein; _provided_ that an Indemnified Person may assert a claim for
indemnification under this Section 9 for any Losses for incidental, punitive,
indirect, special or consequential damages if such Indemnified Person is
required to pay such damages to a third party. No claim for indemnification
may be asserted under this Section 9 relating to or based upon the
misclassification of any Acquired Lease as an operating lease rather than
a capital lease (or financing obligation) under GAAP.

9.2.4. _Third Party Claims_.

 

9.2.4.1. _Notice of Claim_. If any third party notifies an Indemnified Person
with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to
a claim for indemnification against an Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Person will promptly (and, in any event, within twenty (20) days)
give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_
, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Person in notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
under this Section 9, except to the extent such delay actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Party.

 



48 9.2.4.2. _Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a
notice given by the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 9.2.4.1. In
addition, upon written notice to the Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying
Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Person against the Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person; _provided_ that the Indemnified Person may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Person retains separate co-counsel due
to its good faith belief (based on the advice of counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnifying Party) that the interests of the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Person with respect to the such Third Party Claim are in
conflict with one another and, as a result thereof, joint representation is
not possible, then the reasonable expenses of the Indemnified Persons
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party (or from the Escrow Funds if
Rave is the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party will not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (a) provides
for the payment of money as sole relief for the claimant and (b) subject to
the making of such payment, results in the full and general release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liabilities arising from or relating to the Third
Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid or to be paid by an
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense, settlement or other
resolution of any Third Party Claims shall be Losses for purposes of the
monetary limitations set forth in Section 9.2.3 and shall, in the case of any
indemnification claim under Section 9.2.1, be paid solely with Escrow Funds.

9.2.4.3. _Indemnified Person s Control_. If the Indemnifying Party does not
deliver the notice contemplated by Section 9.2.4.2 within twenty (20) days
after the Indemnified Person has given notice of the Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 9.2.4.1, the Indemnified Person may defend, and may
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by the entry of any such
judgment consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without
its prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and the Indemnifying Party shall be permitted to participate in such
defense at its sole cost and expense.

9.2.4.4. _Other Claims_. In the event that any party to this Agreement
proposes to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9 and
such claim does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person making
the claim shall deliver on or prior to the date upon which the applicable
representations and warranties or covenants expire pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, a certificate signed by the Indemnified Person or an officer
of the Indemnified Person (the " _Claim Certificate_ ") to the Indemnifying
Party, which Claim Certificate shall (a) state the occurrence giving rise to
the claim and that the Losses have been incurred, properly accrued or are
anticipated; (b) specify the Section or Sections of this Agreement under which
such claim is made; and (c) specify in reasonable detail each individual item
of Loss or other claim, including

 



49  the amount thereof if reasonably ascertainable, the date such Losses were
incurred, properly accrued or are anticipated to be incurred, the basis for
any anticipated Losses and the nature of the misrepresentation or breach to
which such Losses are related; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
Section 9.1, no delay on the part of the Indemnified Person in notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
under this Section 9, except to the extent such delay actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Party.

9.2.5. _Remedies Exclusive_. The parties agree that from and after the Closing
the remedies provided for in this Section 9 and under the Escrow Agreement
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for all Losses that any such
party (or any other Indemnified Person) may suffer or incur arising from, or
directly or indirectly relating to, the Acquired Companies, the Acquired
Business, the Acquired Theaters, the Acquired Assets, the Excluded Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Liabilities, this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions and the parties hereto hereby waive any other rights
or remedies (whether at law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) that they may have otherwise had or that may arise under any
applicable Contractual Obligations or Legal Requirements against any of the
other parties hereto or any of the respective direct or indirect Affiliates,
officers, managers, directors, employees, advisors, stockholders, members,
consultants, investment bankers, brokers, controlling persons, partners,
managers or other representatives or agents thereof (each of whom shall be an
express third party beneficiary hereof) to the extent arising from, or
directly or indirectly relating to, the Acquired Companies, the Acquired
Business, the Acquired Theaters, the Acquired Assets, the Excluded Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Liabilities, this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to
claims of common law fraud based on the representations and warranties
explicitly set forth in Sections 3 and 4, the foregoing shall only be
effective to the fullest extent such provision is permissible under Delaware
law; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the
parties rights to seek specific performance against other parties hereto as
contemplated by Section 10.12 with respect to covenants to be performed after
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

 

9.2.6. _Tax Treatment_. The parties will treat any payment received pursuant
to this Section 9 as an adjustment to purchase price for Tax and financial
reporting purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

10\. MISCELLANEOUS. 

10.1. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the parties with respect to such subject matter,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement dated February 24, 2012 between
Buyer and Rave (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall survive
execution and delivery of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement
and the Closing.

 



50 10.2. _Amendment or Waiver_. This Agreement can be amended or modified only by
a written instrument executed by Buyer and Rave. No waiver of any provision
of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof
(whether or not similar) or shall constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided nor shall be effective unless in writing.

10.3. _Severability_. In the event that any provision hereof would, under
any applicable Legal Requirement, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect,
such provision shall (to the extent permitted under such applicable Legal
Requirement) be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, such
applicable Legal Requirement. The provisions hereof are severable, and in the
event any provision hereof should be held invalid or unenforceable in any
respect, it shall not invalidate, render unenforceable or otherwise affect
any other provision hereof.

10.4. _Successors and Assigns_.

 

10.4.1. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
solely upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted transferees and assigns (each of
which successors and permitted transferees and assigns shall be a party hereto
for all purposes hereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) no transfer or
assignment by any party hereto shall be permitted without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any such attempted transfer or
assignment without consent shall be null and void and (b) no transfer or
assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

10.4.2. Buyer acknowledges that Rave and its Subsidiaries other than the
Acquired Companies are in the process of disposing of all of their remaining
operating assets and will seek to distribute the net proceeds of such
transactions (including the net proceeds of the Contemplated Transactions to
the members of Rave), wind down their operations and adopt and carry out a
plan of liquidation as promptly as practical following the Closing (the "
_Liquidation Process_ "). It is anticipated that, as part of the Liquidation
Process, Rave shall assign and transfer to the members of Rave (the " _Former
Rave Members_ ") all of Raves right, title and interest in and to the Escrow
Funds and any other payments that may be payable by Buyer following the
Closing. Buyer hereby acknowledges, agrees and consents to such assignment and
transfer (including for purposes of Section 10.4.1 hereof) and consents to the
transfer of Raves rights hereunder to any liquidating trust or other agent
designated by Rave for such purposes in connection with the Liquidation
Process; _provided that_ , prior to the liquidation of Rave, Rave shall assign
to a Person reasonably acceptable to Buyer the right to take such actions
permitted to be taken by Rave in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that Rave shall provide Buyer with written
notice of any such assignment not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the consummation thereof. Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that, other
than Rave, the Seller Related Persons (including all Former Rave Members)
(each of which shall be a third party beneficiary of this Section 10.4.2)
shall have no liability under or by reason of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any other documents entered into in connection herewith or the

 



51  Contemplated Transactions or in respect of the Acquired Assets, the Acquired
Business or the Excluded Assets. The parties agree that this Section 10.4.2 is
an integral provision of this Agreement, and that Raves would not have
entered into this Agreement if not for the inclusion of this Section 10.4.2.

 

10.5. _Notices_. Any notices or other communications required or permitted to
be given or delivered by a party to this Agreement pursuant hereto shall have
been properly given and delivered if in writing by such party or its legal
representative and delivered personally or sent by facsimile, email (provided
that in order for an email to constitute proper notice hereunder, such email
must specifically reference this Section 10.5 and state that it is intended to
constitute notice hereunder), nationally recognized overnight courier service

Days after being sent, if sent by registered or certified mail. Each of the
parties hereto shall be entitled to specify a different address by delivering
notice as aforesaid to each of the other parties hereto.

10.6.  _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claims related to the subject
matter hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

10.7. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each party to this Agreement, by its
execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, City of
Wilmington, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware for the purpose of any action, claim, cause
of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), inquiry proceeding or
investigation arising out of or based upon this Agreement or relating to the
subject matter hereof, (b) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such proceeding brought in one
of the above-named courts is improper, or that this Agreement or the subject
matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court and (c) hereby agrees
not to commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort
or otherwise), inquiry, proceeding or investigation arising out of or based
upon this Agreement or relating to the subject matter hereof other than
before one of the above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other
action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such
action, claim, cause of action or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise),
inquiry, proceeding or investigation to any court other than one of the above-
named court whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each
party hereby consents to service of process in any such proceeding in any
manner permitted by Delaware law, and agrees that service of process by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified pursuant to Section 10.5 is reasonably calculated to give actual
notice.

 

10.8. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY ANY APPLICABLE
LEGAL REQUIREMENT WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT
OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

 



53  FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, ACTION, CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, SUIT (IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION ARISING OUT
OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, IN
EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE COMPANY AND RAVE THAT THIS SECTION 10.8
CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE COMPANY AND RAVE RELYING AND
WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING
HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 10.8 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE
OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

10.9. _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by any Legal
Requirement, no party hereto will issue or make any report, statement or
release to the public (including employees, customers and suppliers of the
parties) with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
without the consent of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If any party hereto is unable to obtain, after
reasonable effort, the approval of its public report, statement or release
from the other parties hereto and such report, statement or release is, in the
opinion of legal counsel to such party, required by Legal Requirement, then
such party may make or issue the legally required report, statement or
release and promptly furnish the other parties with a copy thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the press release
attached as _Exhibit D_ hereto can be issued by any party hereto after this
Agreement is executed and delivered.

10.10. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in Sections
4.7, 5.5, 9.2.5 and 10.4.2 hereof, nothing in this Agreement is intended or
shall be construed to entitle any Person, other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors or permitted transferees and assigns, to any claim,
cause of action, remedy or right of any kind.

10.11. _Expenses_. All Seller Transaction Expenses shall be paid by Buyer on
behalf of Rave pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (if the Contemplated
Transactions are consummated) or by Rave (if the Contemplated Transactions are
not consummated). Whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are
consummated, all costs, fees and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection
with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and any related
agreements or documents and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
shall be paid by Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that it is solely responsible for and shall pay all fees and expenses
payable to Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. in connection with this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions.

 

10.12. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the
parties agrees that, 

 



54  without posting bond or other undertaking, the other parties will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of
the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement
and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of
the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties
and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled,
at law or in equity. Each party further agrees that, in the event of any
action for specific performance in respect of such breach or violation, it
will not assert that the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 

10.13. _Schedules_. The inclusion of information in the Schedules shall not be
an admission or acknowledgment that such information is required to be listed
in the Schedules, that such items are material to the Acquired Companies or
Acquired Business, that such items have had, or would reasonably be expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect or that such items are within or outside
of the ordinary course of business. Furthermore, the inclusion in the
Schedules of information or the exclusion of information from the Schedules
will not establish any level of materiality for purposes of this Agreement.
The headings, if any, of the individual sections and subsections of the
Schedules are inserted for convenience only and will not constitute a part
thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Schedules are arranged in sections
corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely for convenience,
and the disclosure of an item in one section or subsection of the Schedules as
an exception to any particular covenant, representation or warranty will be
deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other
covenants, representations or warranties to the extent that such item is
relevant to such other covenants, representations or warranties, and such
relevance is reasonably apparent on its face, in each case, notwithstanding
the presence or absence of an appropriate section or subsection of the
Schedules with respect to such other covenants, representations or warranties
or an appropriate cross-reference thereto within the text of this Agreement or
the Schedules. The information and statements contained in the Schedules are
not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Rave, the Company or
Buyer except as and to the extent provided in the text of this Agreement.

10.14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and by facsimile or other electronic means (including email)
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument.

10.15. _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions.
