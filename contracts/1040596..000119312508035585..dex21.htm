as of February 20, 2008, by and among ChoicePoint Inc., a Georgia corporation
(the " _Company_ "), Reed Elsevier Group plc, a public limited company
incorporated in England and Wales (" _Parent_ "), and Deuce Acquisition Inc.,
a Georgia corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent, Reed Elsevier PLC and
Reed Elsevier NV have approved, and the boards of directors of Merger Sub and
the Company have adopted, this Agreement providing for the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "); and

_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in Section 14-2-1106 of the
Georgia Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ ").

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York 10004, at 9:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the fourth business day (the "
_Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
   accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 P.M. (Eastern Time) other
than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized
to close in New York, New York or London, England.

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be completed, executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Georgia as provided in Section 14-2-1105(b)
and Section 14-2-1105.1 of the GBCC. The Merger shall become effective at the

parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE II

_Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation_

2.1. _The Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation set forth

Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable Laws (as defined in Section 5.1(i)).

2.2. _The By-Laws_. The by-laws set forth in _Annex C_ shall be the by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "), until duly amended as provided
therein or by applicable Laws.

ARTICLE III

_Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and
the By-Laws.

3.2.  _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed

-2- ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates_

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.10
per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties (which, for purposes of clarity, shall include any
such Shares held in the Executive Benefit Trust and the Employee Stock Benefit
Trust, which Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration (as defined below)), and (ii) Shares that are
owned by shareholders who are entitled to dissent from the Merger and demand
payment for such Shares and who properly exercise and do not waive, withdraw
or otherwise lose such right pursuant to Article 13 of the GBCC ("
_Dissenting Shareholders_ ", and each of the Shares in (i) and (ii), an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted
into the right to receive $50.00 per Share in cash (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 4.2(f).

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a
cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash  



 

-3-  being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing. Any interest and other income resulting from any such investments
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five business days following the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided
in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash
to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the
Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.



 

-4- (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for 180 calendar days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(f) _Dissenters  Rights_. No Person who has exercised dissenters rights
pursuant to Article 13 of the GBCC shall be entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless
and until such Person shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to dissent under the GBCC. Each Dissenting Shareholder shall be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Article 13 of the GBCC with
respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for payment, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to shareholders
dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for payment under the GBCC. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for payment, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it  



 

-5-  reasonably determines in good faith it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n)) Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) to the extent so remitted, shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a)  _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 5.1(b)(i)), to the extent unvested shall vest in full upon
the Effective Time (in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans as
amended immediately prior to the date hereof in accordance with Section
6.10(c)), and each Company Option shall be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Company Option to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within five business
days thereafter, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess, if any,
of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under
such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment.

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. Each Share granted subject to vesting or
other lapse restrictions pursuant to any of the Companys Stock Plans (each,
a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of such restrictions as
of the Effective Time (in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans
as amended immediately prior to the date hereof in accordance with Section
6.10(c)) and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to each such Company
Restricted Share in accordance with Section 4.1, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(c) _Company Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Share Equivalent
Unit (each a " _Company Unit_ ") under the Stock Plans, to the extent then
unvested, shall vest in full upon the Effective Time (in accordance with the
terms of the Stock Plans as amended immediately prior to the date hereof in
accordance with Section 6.10(c)), and each Company Unit shall be converted
into an obligation to pay the holder thereof an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Such obligation shall be payable in accordance with and at the
time set forth under the terms of the agreement, plan or arrangement relating
to such Company Unit (or, if earlier, on the death of the holder thereof) and,
prior to the time of  



 

-6-  payment, such unpaid amounts shall be credited with interest at the
applicable federal rate at the Closing provided for in Section 1274(d) of the
Code compounded semiannually, and such payments when paid will be subject to
withholding of applicable Taxes required to be withheld.

(d)  _Company Deferred Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
deferred Share (each, a " _Deferred Share_ ") under the Stock Plans shall vest
in full upon the Effective Time and be converted into an obligation to pay an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject
to such Deferred Share immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration. Such obligation shall be payable in full
(without exercise of discretionary proration) on the later of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the first business day following January 1, 2009 (or,
if earlier, on the death of the holder thereof) and, prior to the time of
payment, such unpaid amounts shall be credited with interest at the
applicable federal rate at the Closing provided for in Section 1274(d) of the
Code compounded semiannually, and such payments when paid will be subject to
withholding of applicable Taxes required to be withheld.

(e) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by
the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may
be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the
Stock Plans and any other Company Benefit Plans, other than Company
Options, Company Units, Company Restricted Shares and Deferred Shares
(collectively, the " _Company Awards_ "), shall be converted into an
obligation to pay, at the time specified in the applicable plan, agreement or
arrangement, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to
such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time times (y) the Per
Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award provides for payments to
the extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified reference price, the
amount, if any, by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such
reference price). Such obligation shall be payable or distributable in
accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or arrangement relating to
such Company Awards (or, if earlier, on the death of the holder thereof) and,
prior to the time of distribution, such amounts shall be permitted to be
deemed invested in an investment option under the applicable plan, and when
paid will be subject to withholding of applicable Taxes required to be
withheld.

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions or take
action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, and use reasonable
best efforts to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.3(a), Section 4.3(b),
Section 4.3(c), Section 4.3(d) and Section 4.3(e). The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that after the Effective Time neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Units, Deferred Shares
or Company Awards or otherwise.



 

-7- 4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as
a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

ARTICLE V

_Representations and Warranties_

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in
each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section and in any
section relating to forward looking statements) or in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that: 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or
authority, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and by-laws or
similar governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement,
and each as so made available is in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of
the Companys Subsidiaries and each jurisdiction where the Company and its
Subsidiaries are organized.

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the securities
or ownership  



 

-8-  interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors, managers or other persons performing similar
functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such Person and/or
by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _Significant Subsidiary_ " is as
defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and
(iii) " _Material Adverse Effect_ " with respect to the Company means a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties,
assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following, in and of itself or themselves, shall constitute a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Company:

(A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United States
or other countries in which the Company conducts material operations or
changes that are the result of acts of war or terrorism;

(B) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the

otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or
development underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to,
a Material Adverse Effect; and

(F) any action or omission required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
pursuant to the express written request of Parent;

_provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (D), such

credentialing and insurance services, and related data and analytics
industries, and the insurance business process software industry. For purposes
of clarity, any Remedial Actions undertaken by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Parents obligations in Section 6.5 shall not be counted towards any
calculation of Material Adverse Effect.

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 400,000,000
Shares, of which 67,859,898 Shares were outstanding as of the close of
business on February 18, 2008, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of
which no shares are outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly

Compensation Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan No. 2 (collectively, the "
_Stock Plans_ ") and Shares subject to issuance under the Stock Plans, the

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance
(each, a " _Lien_ "). Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any
issuance of Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not have outstanding
any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have
the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having
the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on any matter.

(ii) Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each
of the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in
each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other  



 

-10-  Person or Persons in each such Subsidiary and (y) the Companys or its
Subsidiaries capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect
ownership interest in any other Person other than securities in a publicly
traded company held for investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and consisting of less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of such
company. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting
interest in any Person that requires an additional filing by Parent under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR
Act_ ").

(iii) Each Company Option (A) was granted in compliance with all applicable
Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan pursuant to which
it was issued, (B) has an exercise price per Share equal to or greater than
the fair market value of a Share on the date of such grant as reported on the
NYSE (as defined in Section 5.1(e)(ii)) and (C) qualifies for the Tax and
accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option in the Companys Tax
Returns (as defined in Section 5.1(n)) and the Company Reports, respectively.

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only
to approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a shareholders meeting duly called
and held for such purpose (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ "). This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously adopted this
Agreement and approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and resolved to recommend the approval of this Agreement to the
holders of Shares (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (B) received the
opinions of its financial advisor, Goldman Sachs and Co., dated on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Shares and (C) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Shares for their approval. The board of directors
of the Company has taken all action so that neither Parent nor Merger Sub will
be an "interested shareholder" or prohibited from entering into or
consummating a "business combination" with the Company (in each case as such
term is used in Article 11 of the GBCC) as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions in the manner
contemplated hereby.

any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to
be obtained by the Company from, any Federal, state or foreign governmental or
regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court or other legislative,
executive or judicial governmental entity (each a " _Governmental Entity_ "),
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or in connection with the continuing operation of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time, except those that the failure to make or obtain are not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or by-laws of
the Company or similar governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case as in effect, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach
or violation of, a termination, cancellation or modification (or right of
termination, cancellation or modification) or default under, the payment of
additional fees, the creation or acceleration of any obligations under or the
creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement, lease, license, contract,
settlement, consent, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation not otherwise terminable by the other party thereto on 90 calendar
days or less notice (each, a " _Contract_ ") binding upon the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or, assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.1(d)(i), under any Law to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject, or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any Contract binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such
breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change
that is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

-12- (e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") since December 31, 2005
(the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, reports and documents
filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto,
the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished complied in all material respects or, if not yet
filed or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as
of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this
Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "). Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including
Section 13(k)(2) and Section 13(k)(3) thereof or rules of the SEC, since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any
extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer
or director of the Company or any of its Affiliates. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " when used with respect to any party shall
mean any Person who is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule
405 promulgated under the Securities Act.

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that material information required to
be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial
reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the  



 

-13-  maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on its financial statements. The Company has
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer
and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys board of
directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and has identified for the Companys auditors and
audit committee of the Companys board of directors any material weaknesses in
internal control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company
has made available to Parent (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by
management to the Companys auditors and audit committee since the Applicable
Date and (ii) any communication since the Applicable Date made by management
or the Companys auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by
listing standards of the NYSE, the audit committees charter or professional
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since the
Applicable Date, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Company
employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been
received by the Company. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of
all complaints or concerns relating to other matters made since the
Applicable Date through the Companys whistleblower hot line or equivalent
system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible violations of Law.
No attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence
of a violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit committee (or other
committee designated for the purpose) of the board of directors or the board
of directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any policy of the Company contemplating such reporting,
including in instances not required by those rules.

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Company  



 

-14-  Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated
statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or in the case
of Company Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present
in all material respects the results of operations, retained earnings (loss)
and changes in financial position, as the case may be, for the periods set
forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2006 through the date
hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in accordance with the ordinary course of such businesses
consistent with past practices and there has not been:

(i) any change in the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
business or results of their operations or any circumstance, occurrence or
development (including any adverse change with respect to any circumstance,
occurrence or development existing on or prior to December 31, 2006) of which
the Company has knowledge which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

(ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (except for dividends or other distributions by any

Subsidiaries;

(iii) any material change in any method of financial accounting or accounting
practice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

(iv) (A) any increase in the compensation or benefits payable or to become

with general salary increases of the Company) or (B) any
establishment, adoption, entry into or amendment of any collective
bargaining, bonus, profit sharing, equity, thrift, compensation, employment,
termination, severance or other plan, agreement, trust, fund, policy or
arrangement for the benefit of any director, officer or employee, except to
the extent required by applicable Law; or



 

-15- (v) any agreement to do any of the foregoing

As used in this Agreement, the term "knowledge" when used in the phrases "to
the knowledge of the Company," "of which the Company has knowledge," or "the
Company has no knowledge" or words of similar import shall mean the actual
knowledge of the Persons listed in Section 5.1(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, oppositions, litigations,
objections, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings ("
_Actions_ ") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligations or liabilities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise, (including those relating to matters involving any Environmental
Law (as defined in Section 5.1(m))), except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in the Companys consolidated balance sheets (and the notes thereto)
included in the Company Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (b)
for obligations or liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
since December 31, 2006, or (c) for those that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any material Actions involving the privacy of
consumers. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to the provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction,
decree, award, stipulation or settlement (" _Judgment_ ") of any Governmental
Entity which is, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, employment agreements, contracts,
policies or arrangements covering current or former employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (the " _Employees_ ") and current or former directors of
the Company, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation, severance, stock
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, Company stock based,
incentive and bonus plans (collectively, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "),
other than Company Benefit Plans maintained outside of the United States
primarily for the benefit of Employees working outside of the United States
(such plans hereinafter being referred to as " _Company Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans_ "), are listed in Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and each Company Benefit Plan which has received a favorable opinion letter
from the IRS National Office,  



 

-16-  including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified. True
and complete copies of all Company Benefit Plans listed in Section 5.1(h)(i)

Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (collectively, " _Company U.S. Benefit Plans_
"), are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable
Laws. Each Company U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (a " _Company
ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Company Pension Plan_ ") intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_
") covering all tax Law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of
the qualification of such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect
to any Company ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such
transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, would subject the
Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.
Any voluntary employees beneficiary association within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code which provides benefits under a U.S. Benefit Plan has
(A) received an opinion letter from the IRS recognizing its exempt status
under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (B) filed a timely notice with the IRS
pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in the loss
of such exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(iii) Neither the Company, any or its Subsidiaries nor any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an " _Company ERISA Affiliate_ ") (x) maintains or
contributes to or has within the past six years maintained or contributed to a
Company Pension Plan that is subject to Subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA
or (y) maintains or has an obligation to contribute to or has within the past
six years maintained or had an obligation to contribute to a Multiemployer
Plan. All contributions required to be made under each Company Benefit Plan,
as of the date of this Agreement, have been timely made or, if not required to
be made or paid on or before the date hereof, to the extent required by
generally accepted accounting principles, any unpaid obligations in respect
of each Company Benefit  



 

-17-  Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
Reports prior to the date of this Agreement.

(iv) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company threatened, claims (other than routine claims for
benefits) or litigation relating to the Company Benefit Plans, and to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for any such claims or litigation.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Company ERISA Plan or collective
bargaining agreement except for health continuation coverage as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA. The Company or its
Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without
incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred
prior to such amendment or termination.

(v) Neither the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(w) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date of this Agreement, (x) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Company Benefit Plans, or (y) limit or restrict the right of the Company or,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans. The data provided
to Ernst and Young for purposes of the Section 280G calculations for Derek
Smith and Douglas Curling is true and correct in all material respects.

(vi) Neither the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans which would not be
deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. Section
5.1(h)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter separately lists any Company
Benefit Plans that provide for a Section 4999 gross-up or cut back.

(vii) All Company Benefit Plans that are "nonqualified deferred compensation
plans" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) have been maintained
and administered in good faith compliance with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code and any regulations or other guidance issued thereunder. No
Company Benefit Plan provides for a Section 409A gross-up or indemnity.



 

-18- (viii) All Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with
applicable Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded
liabilities with respect to any such Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened material claims (other than routine claims for benefits)
or litigation relating to Company Non-U.S. Benefit Plans, and to the knowledge
of the Company, there are no circumstances that exist that could reasonably be
expected to be a basis for any such claims or litigation. All Company
Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed in Section 5.1(h)(viii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(i)  _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation
of any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, common law,
or any rule, regulation, standard, judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree,
arbitration award, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "), including all Laws applicable to the use,
storage, commercialization, protection and distribution of the data contained
in the information databases of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Company Databases_ "), except for violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have been and are substantially in compliance with the terms of the
Stipulated Final Judgment and Order for Civil Penalties, Permanent Injunction,
and Other Equitable Relief consented to by the Company, the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States of America on
February 15, 2006. No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental
Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for such
investigations or reviews the outcome of which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, no material
change is required in the Companys or any its Subsidiaries processes,
properties or procedures in connection with any such Laws, and the Company
has not received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance
with any such Laws that has not been cured as of the date of this Agreement.
The Company and its Subsidiaries each has obtained and is in compliance with
all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals, registrations, consents,
authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted
by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to conduct its business
as presently conducted, except where the failure to so obtain or to be in such
compliance is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that subscribes for or
licenses data contained in the Company Databases (i) states on the face of
such customers Contract with the Company  



 

-19-  or any of its Subsidiaries either such customers appropriate use for such
data or that such customers use for such data will be lawful, and (ii) to
the knowledge of the Company, limits its use to those stated purposes and
takes appropriate measures to protect against the misuse of such data.

(j) _Material Contracts and Government Contracts_.

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by:

(A) other than with respect to any partnership that is wholly owned by the
Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, any partnership, joint
venture or other similar agreement or arrangement relating to the formation,
creation, operation, management or control of any partnership or joint
venture material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in which the
Company owns more than a 10% voting or economic interest;

-32- 6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any officer or director of it or any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall use its best efforts to instruct and cause its and
its Subsidiaries employees, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees,
financial advisors attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); or

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time
that, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may
(A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal providing for
the acquisition of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Companys
outstanding equity securities if the Company receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
not more favorable to such other Person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7); and promptly discloses
(and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to
the extent not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal of the type described above; or (C)
after having complied with Section 6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise
declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable
(publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the
extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or
(C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above,
the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith based on
the information then available and (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C)
above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.



 

-33- (b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries and (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire
by tender offer, share exchange or in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20%
or more of the total voting power of any class of equity securities of the
Company or those of any of its Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the
consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of
its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in such definition changed from 20% to 50%) that the
board of directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel),
prior to the time that the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, is reasonably
likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable
to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the transaction that may be proposed by Parent) and
the time likely to be required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal.

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of directors
shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a))
(an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the board of
directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
 



 

-34-  Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Superior Proposal not solicited in breach of this Section 6.2 and made after
the date of this Agreement, if the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Change of Recommendation may be made until after at least 48 hours
following Parents receipt of notice from the Company advising that management
of the Company currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that
it take such action and the basis therefor, including all necessary
information under Section 6.2(f). In determining whether to make a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of
the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does
not reaffirm the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation and Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.5(b).

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps
to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 6.2(e) of the obligations undertaken in this Section
6.2 and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements)
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.



 

-35- 6.3. _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_. (a) The Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Shareholders
Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4) (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company
agrees, as to it and its Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information
supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to shareholders
of the Company or at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement shall, at the time the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the shareholders of the Company at the time of the Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC
for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts
promptly to provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received
on the Proxy Statement by the SEC, and the Company shall cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the staff
of the SEC advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company
may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. 

6.4. _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company shall take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and by-laws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Shareholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement
to consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and shall
not adjourn or postpone such meeting except to the extent required by Law.
Subject to Section 6.2(c) hereof, the board of directors of the Company shall
recommend such approval and shall take all lawful action to solicit such
approval of this Agreement and the Company Requisite Vote. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if on a date for which the Shareholders Meeting is scheduled
(the " _Original Date_ "), which Original Date shall be on or prior to the
45th calendar day after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement, the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to
approve the Merger, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have
the right to postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of, the Shareholders Meeting as long as the date
of the  



 

-36-  Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned more than 15 calendar
days in connection with any one postponement or adjournment or more than
an aggregate of 30 calendar days from the Original Date in reliance on this
subsection.

6.5. _Cooperation; Information_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent each shall cooperate with the
other and use, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or cause to
be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as
reasonably practicable, this Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including preparing and filing, as soon as reasonably
practicable, all documentation to effect notices, reports and other filings
necessary, proper or advisable to be filed with, and obtaining, as soon as
reasonably practicable, all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained from, any third
party or any Governmental Entity.

(b) Subject to applicable Laws and the requirements of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from any third
party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent each shall
have the right to review reasonably in advance and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Company and Parent each shall consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of
its Subsidiaries, that is to appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing
rights, the Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The Company will cooperate with Parent and provide such
assistance as Parent may reasonably request to promote the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and facilitate the Closing hereunder.

(c) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the
other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, to any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) The Company agrees to cooperate with, and take such reasonable actions
(which shall occur substantially simultaneously with, or be conditioned on
the occurrence of, the Closing) as are deemed necessary or prudent by Parent
to effect the transfer of certain cleared or classified Contracts to an
appropriate affiliate of Parent in a lawful manner at the Effective Time.



 

-37- 6.6. _Government Filings and Other Matters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement:

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable,
and in respect of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, make any filings with or notifications to (i) the FTC and the
United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") pursuant to the HSR Act
and (ii) any other Governmental Entity as may be required by any other
Antitrust Law. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Law_ "
shall mean Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 7 and 7A of the
Clayton Antitrust Act, and corresponding Laws of any state or foreign
jurisdiction.

(b) In the event that the FTC or the DOJ issues a Request for Additional
Information and Documentary Material (a " _Second Request_ ") under the HSR
Act in relation to the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall take such measures as may be
reasonably necessary to limit the scope of such Second Request, certify
substantial compliance with such Second Request and otherwise respond to and
seek to resolve any requests for information, documents, data or testimony
made by the FTC or the DOJ under the HSR Act.

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be
done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable:

(i) to secure clearance under all applicable Antitrust Laws (including
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period thereunder) of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
Termination Date; and

(ii) to prevent the entry of, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order relating to any
applicable Antitrust Law that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

in each case of (i) and (ii) including by agreeing to accept any undertaking
or condition, to enter into any consent decree or hold separate order, to make
any divestiture, to accept any operational restriction or limitation, or to
take any other action that Parent reasonably determines is necessary in order
to satisfy any applicable Antitrust Law that would prevent the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
Termination Date (a " _Remedial Action_ ").



 

-38- (d) Subject to Parents obligation, if necessary, to take any Remedial Action
prior to the Termination Date in satisfaction of its obligations under
Section 6.6(c) with respect to the enforcement of any Antitrust Law, nothing
in Section 6.5 or this Section 6.6 shall be interpreted to prohibit, restrict,
limit or restrain Parent from engaging in litigation, including litigation to
prevent the imposition by any Governmental Entity of any Material Burden (as
defined below), and Parent shall have the sole and exclusive right to direct
and control any such litigation, with counsel of its own choosing, and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect thereto.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Material Burden_ " shall mean any
undertaking, condition, consent decree, hold separate order, divestiture,
operational restriction or limitation or other action by any Governmental
Entity that, if effected, would reasonably be expected to restrict, limit,
restrain or impair (A) Parents ability to own, operate, retain or change all
or a material portion of the assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates from and after the Effective Time or any of
the assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (including, without limitation, by requiring any sale,
divestiture, transfer, license, lease, disposition of or encumbrance or hold
separate arrangement with respect to any such assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein) or (B) Parents
ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full
ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.5 and this Section 6.6 to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or the Company be obligated to agree to
any Material Burden that is not conditional on the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.5 and this Section 6.6 to the
contrary, with respect to the matters covered in this Section 6.6, it is
agreed that Parent, after consulting with the Company and considering
the Companys views in good faith, shall make all decisions, lead all
discussions, negotiations and other proceedings, and coordinate all activities
with respect to any requests that may be made by, or any actions, consents,
undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be sought by, any Governmental
Entity, including determining the manner in which to contest or otherwise
respond, by litigation or otherwise, to objections to, or proceedings
challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees to take such reasonable
actions as are deemed prudent by Parent to secure needed approvals from any
Governmental Entity and to assist Parent in litigating or
otherwise contesting objections to, or proceedings challenging, the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall not permit any of its Representatives to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation, proceeding or other inquiry unless it consults with
Parent in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental  



 

-39-  Entity, gives Parent the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.
Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to communications with
any Governmental Entity, and will, to the extent reasonably practicable and
not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, give the Company the opportunity
to attend and, consistent with the provisions of this sub-paragraph,
participate thereat. The Company agrees that, at the sole discretion and
direction of Parent (and at Parents expense), it shall agree to any and all
divestitures or other remedies relating to itself or any of its Subsidiaries
that are necessary to ensure the termination or expiration of the waiting
period under the HSR Act or the obtaining of any other approvals or consents
required from any Governmental Entity under any applicable Antitrust Law to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 6.6(f) shall obligate the
Company to agree to any divestiture or any other remedy not conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement where such divestiture or other remedy would involve any cost to the
Company that is not reimbursed by Parent.

6.7. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to
its employees, properties, books, Contracts and records and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ , that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to furnish such
information in a manner that does not result in any such disclosure, or (ii)
to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries if the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish such information in a manner that does not result in the loss of such
privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.7
shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.8. _Stock Exchange De-listing; Deregistration_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of
the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.



 

-40- 6.9. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger issued by the
Company and Parent shall be subject to the prior approval of the other party,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and thereafter the
Company and Parent each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any
press releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service)
with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Government Entity.

6.10. _Employee Benefits_. (a) During the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") base salary or wages, annual
cash incentive compensation opportunities and pension and welfare benefits
that in the aggregate are no less than the base salary or wages, annual cash
incentive compensation opportunities and pension and welfare benefits
currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees. 

(b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans which the Company Employees
are entitled to participate in to take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting with respect to any such employee benefit plans and
for purposes of benefit accrual for purposes of vacation, paid-time off and
severance pay plans and any similar welfare benefit plans which take length
of service into account for purposes of determining levels of benefits,
except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement medical or
life insurance benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits, the service of the Company Employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entity to the extent the Company recognized
such service for purposes of the Company Benefit Plans) as if such service
were with Parent or its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable plan of the Company (and to the extent there is
not a comparable Company Benefit Plan, based on the adjusted service date
reflected in the Companys records or if not reflected therein, in accordance
with the Adjusted Service Date Policy of the Company, dated as of August 16,
2006 and in effect as of the date hereof). In addition, Parent shall cause any
and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such
limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under comparable
Company Benefit Plans) and eligibility waiting periods under group health
plans of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to be waived with
respect to Company Employees who remain as employees of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates (and their eligible dependents) and cause
to be credited any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Company
Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the
calendar year prior to their participation in the health plans of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates with the objective that there
be no double counting during the year in which the Closing Date occurs of
such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses.



 

-41- (c) The Company and Parent acknowledge that there will be a "change in
control" of the Company at the Effective Time under the Stock Plans and the
Company Benefit Plans listed in Section 6.10(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. The board of directors and/or the compensation committee of the
Company, as applicable, will adopt resolutions to approve amendments that
provide that a "change in control" does not occur in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Effective Time under
any of the Stock Plans and Company Benefit Plans listed in Section
6.10(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing reasonably
in advance of the Effective Time, the Company shall amend the employee benefit
plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to
provide that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other then the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall commence participation
therein following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, if
requested by Parent in writing reasonably in advance of the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause any or all Company 401(k) Plans (other than the
Signature Information Solutions LLC 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan) to be
terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that Company Employees participating in any such Company 401(k) Plans shall
be immediately eligible to participate in an alternative 401(k) plan as of the
Effective Time. Such plan shall have all terms necessary to permit rollovers
(including of loans) from such Company 401(k) Plan, unless it is determined
in the judgment of Parent that any such rollover is reasonably likely to
affect adversely the tax qualified status of such alternative 401(k) plan.

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, take all action necessary to effectuate the agreements set
forth in Section 6.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and assume the
Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 6.10(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any
third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.10 or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to (x) maintain any particular benefit plan or (y) retain the
employment of any particular employee.

6.11. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense. 

6.12. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify  



 

-42-  and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under the GBCC (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation also to advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under the GBCC; _provided_ , that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification), each present and former director and officer of the Company
and its Subsidiaries when acting in such capacity (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.12(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.12(b) to pay for
only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction
unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_ , that the fewest number of
counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (ii) the
Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and
(iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to  



 

-43-  obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the
extension of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as the Companys existing policies with respect to any matter claimed against
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of
him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance
for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an annual premium amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.12.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.12 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the articles
of incorporation or by-laws (or other similar governing documents) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

6.13. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
 



 

-44-  Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

and the second sentence of Section 9.1 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. 

(b) In the event that:

(i) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or publicly

Proposal"); _provided_ , that for purposes of this Agreement, an Acquisition
Proposal shall not be deemed to have been "publicly and irrevocably withdrawn"

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b) or any portion of such fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
