upon in writing by the Parties; provided that the Closing shall not be
required to occur prior to thirty (30) days from the date hereof or such
earlier date specified by Purchaser to the Sellers upon not less than two (2)

Date"). The Closing shall be effective as of 11:59 p.m. New York City time on
the Closing Date.



SECTION 2.04 Closing Deliveries. At the Closing:



(a)the Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser or its
designees:



(i)a certification from each Seller pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2) substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B;

such certificates to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i) shall be to make
an appropriate withholding to the extent required by Section 1445 of the Code;



(ii)an assignment of the Interests to Purchaser, in form and substance
satisfactory to Purchaser substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C, in each case duly executed by each Seller;

required to be delivered by Sellers at or prior to the Closing pursuant to
Section 6.02 or as are otherwise reasonably required in connection with this
Agreement.



(b)Purchaser shall:



(i)pay the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.02;



(ii)to the extent that the Debt Pay-Off Letters have been obtained, pay to
each party holding Paid-Off Debt, as addressed (to the extent applicable) in
the Debt Pay-Off Letters, the applicable portion of the Paid-Off Debt, in such
amounts and to such accounts as set forth in the Debt Pay-Off Letters; and



(iii)deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Sellers the Parent Guarantee and
such other agreements, documents, instruments and writings as are required to
be delivered by Purchaser at or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the
terms of Section 6.03 or as are otherwise reasonably required in connection
with this Agreement.



SECTION 2.05 Pad Gas Lease Adjustment. Within ten (10) Business Days following
the payment of the Purchase Option Price (as defined in the Pad Gas Lease) to
Credit Suisse Energy LLC pursuant to Section 9.2(b) of the Pad Gas Lease in
respect of the purchase of the Pad Gas (as defined in the Pad Gas Lease), if
the Purchase Option Price is less than the Purchase Option Price Floor (the
amount of such deficiency, the "Purchase Option Price Deficiency"), then
Purchaser agrees to pay, or to cause the Cardinal Companies to pay, an amount
equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Option Price Deficiency to
Sellers in the same percentages to which each Seller is entitled to receive
the Closing Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.02 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the
Purchase Option Price is equal to or greater than the Purchase Option Price
Floor then there shall be no payments made to the Sellers in respect of the

not to, alter, modify, amend or waive any right under the Pad Gas Lease with
an intention to decrease or eliminate any amounts that may become payable to
Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.05.



SECTION 2.06 Paid-Off Debt. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain payoff letters for all indebtedness of the Cardinal
Companies arising under the matters set forth on Section 2.06 of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule which is outstanding immediately prior to Closing (the
"Paid-Off Debt"), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser,
in each case indicating the amount required to pay off such Paid-Off Debt at
Closing and stating that Lien releases necessary to remove any Liens
associated therewith may be filed by Purchaser after such amounts are received
(collectively, the "Debt Pay-Off Letters"); provided, that the Sellers shall
only be obligated to use such commercially reasonable efforts upon the
reasonable request of Purchaser.



SECTION 2.07 Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties intend that for U.S. federal
and other applicable income tax purposes, the Interest Purchase is intended to
be treated as (i) with respect to Sellers, as a sale of partnership interests
and (ii) with respect to Purchaser, as a deemed liquidation of the Company
followed by a purchase by Purchaser of the assets of the Company that were
deemed to have been distributed to Sellers in such liquidation.

perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Purchaser of this Agreement and the other agreements and instruments to be
delivered hereunder, and the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Purchaser. This Agreement constitutes (assuming the due execution
and delivery by each of the other Parties hereto) a valid and legally binding
obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser, as applicable, in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



SECTION 4.03 Consents; Litigation. No Consent of, or Filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by Purchaser which has
not been obtained or made by Purchaser in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other agreements and instruments to be
delivered hereunder by Purchaser and the consummation by Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other than (a) the Purchaser's
Required Consents set forth on Section 4.03 of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule and (b) the Consents and Filings the failure of which to obtain or
make would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect
on Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. No legal action, suit, arbitration,
governmental investigation or other legal, judicial or administrative
proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, against
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (excluding any Cardinal Company), that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



SECTION 4.04 Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other agreements and instruments to be delivered hereunder
by Purchaser does not, and, subject to obtaining Purchaser's Required
Consents, the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not contravene or violate any provision
of (a) the Organizational Documents of Purchaser, (b) any mortgage, lease,
franchise, license, permit, agreement or other instrument to which Purchaser
is a party or by which Purchaser is bound, or result in the termination or
acceleration thereof, or entitle any party to accelerate any obligation or
indebtedness thereunder, or (c) any Law to which Purchaser is subject or by
which any property or asset of Purchaser is bound or affected except, in the
case of clauses (b) and (c), as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on Purchaser's
ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.



SECTION 4.05 Compliance with Laws. Purchaser is not in violation of any Law,
except for violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on Purchaser's
ability to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.



SECTION 4.06 Brokers. Purchaser and its Affiliates do not have any liability
or obligation to pay fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Sellers
or their Affiliates could become liable or obliged.



SECTION 4.07 Investment Intent. Purchaser acknowledges that neither the offer
nor the sale of the Interests has been registered under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Securities Act"), or under any state or foreign securities
laws. Purchaser is acquiring the Interests for its own account for investment,
without a view to, or for a resale in connection with, the distribution
thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state or foreign
securities laws and with no present intention of distributing or reselling any
part thereof. Purchaser will not so distribute or resell any of the Interests
in violation of any such laws.



SECTION 4.08 Available Funds; Source of Funds. Purchaser has or will have at
Closing cash on hand or existing committed credit facilities in an aggregate
amount sufficient to enable Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to otherwise perform its obligations
hereunder in accordance with the timing set forth in Article 2, including to
pay in full the Purchase Price in accordance with Article 2 and all fees and
expenses payable by Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser represents and warrants that all
funds to be paid to Sellers shall not have been derived from, or constitute,
either directly or indirectly, the proceeds of any criminal activity under the
anti-money laundering laws of the United States.



SECTION 4.09 Investigation. Purchaser is a sophisticated entity, knowledgeable
about the industry in which the Cardinal Companies operate, experienced in
investments in such businesses and able to bear the economic risk associated
with the purchase of the Interests. Purchaser has such knowledge and
experience as to be aware of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the
purchase of interests of the type contemplated in this Agreement, as well as
the knowledge of the Cardinal Companies and their operations in particular,
and has independently made its own analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement.

SECTION 4.10 Legal Impediments. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there are no
facts relating to Purchaser, any applicable Law or any Contract to which
Purchaser is a party that would disqualify Purchaser from obtaining control of
the Interests or the Cardinal Companies or that would prevent, delay or limit
the ability of Purchaser to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. ARTICLE 5



Covenants

SECTION 5.01 Tax Matters.

(a)Tax Returns. The Parties acknowledge that, for U.S. federal Income Tax
purposes, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result in a
termination of the Company on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 708(b) of
the Code and that accordingly the taxable year of the Company will close as of
the Closing Date for all of the Company's members. At least thirty (30) days
prior to filing any Income Tax Return of a Cardinal Company with respect to
any Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall cause a draft copy of such Income
Tax Return to be delivered to Sellers for their review and comment. The
Company shall cause such Income Tax Returns not to be filed without Sellers'
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and shall cause any
comments provided to the Company by Sellers to be incorporated in such Income
Tax Returns prior to filing unless the Company, in its reasonable discretion,
objects to such comments.



(b)Tax Contests. Purchaser and the Cardinal Companies shall promptly notify
Sellers in writing upon receiving notice of any audit, assessment, litigation,
contest or other proceeding relating to Taxes for which the Sellers could
reasonably be expected to be liable, including any Income Taxes relating to
the Cardinal Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Period (a "Tax
Contest"), and shall promptly deliver to Sellers copies of all correspondence
received in connection with any such Tax Contest. Sellers shall be entitled,
and Purchaser shall afford Sellers the opportunity, to participate in any such
Tax Contest. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing,
the Cardinal Companies) shall keep Sellers promptly informed of all material
developments with respect to such Tax Contest (including by providing copies
of all communications in connection therewith) and shall not settle or
compromise any such Tax Contest without Sellers' prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c)Cooperation. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.01,
Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate fully, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
any Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and
any Tax Contest or other proceeding with respect to such Tax Returns. Such
cooperation shall include the retention as provided in Section 5.03 and (upon
a Party's reasonable request) the provision of records and information which
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, Tax Contest or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The requesting Party shall reimburse the cooperating Parties for
all reasonable costs and documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
cooperating Parties.

in respect of Transfer Taxes imposed on or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand, shall each be liable for and shall pay fifty percent (50%) of
all such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Sellers and their respective Affiliates from and against any and all liability
for the payment of fifty percent (50%) of such Transfer Taxes and the filing
of such Tax Returns. Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against any and all
liability for the payment of fifty percent (50%) of such Transfer Taxes.



(e)Purchase Price Allocation. Not later than thirty (30) Business Days after
the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser an allocation
schedule setting forth Sellers' determination of the allocation of the sum of the Purchase Price and assumed
(or deemed assumed) obligations to the extent properly taken into account
under the Code among the assets of the Cardinal Companies that complies with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "Allocation"). Sellers and Purchaser shall work in good faith to resolve
any disputes relating to the Allocation within 30 days. If Sellers and
Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be
resolved promptly by the a nationally recognized independent accounting firm
to be mutually selected by Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, the costs of which shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the
Sellers, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser, on the other
hand. Sellers and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
update the Allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code
following any adjustment to the allocable Purchase Price or any other amounts
constituting consideration for federal Income Tax purposes pursuant to this
Agreement. Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
report consistently with the Allocation in all Tax Returns, and none of the
Parties shall take any position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent with
the Allocation, as adjusted, in each case, unless required to do so by a final
determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code or with the consent of
the other Parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Each of the Sellers and Purchaser agrees to promptly advise each
other regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation
related to the Allocation; provided, that nothing in this Section 5.01(f)
shall require any of the Parties to litigate before any court or challenge any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging the
Allocation; provided, further, that, after consultation with the party (or
parties) adversely affected by any Taxing Authority allocation (or proposed
allocation), the other party (or parties) hereto may file such protective
claims or Tax Returns as may be reasonably required to protect its (or their)
interests.



(f)Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. If
Purchaser determines that any deduction or withholding is required in respect
of a payment pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser shall provide notice to
Sellers no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which such payment
is to be made, with a written explanation substantiating the requirement to
withhold, provided however that if Sellers fail to deliver the certifications
contemplated by Section 2.04(a)(i) then Purchaser shall not be required to
provide any such notice or written explanation with respect to amounts
required to be withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code as a result of
such failure. Purchaser shall promptly remit all withheld amounts to the
applicable Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law. Any amounts
that are so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Seller or Sellers in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made.



(g)Tax Liability and Indemnity. After the Closing, the Sellers shall be
responsible for, and shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify Purchaser and
hold it harmless from and against: (i) all Taxes of any Seller related to the
Cardinal Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods, and (ii) with respect to any
taxable period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
("Straddle Period"), all Taxes of any Seller related to the Cardinal Companies
attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period that ends on and includes
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 5.01(g), in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Period
(including, without limitation, each Seller's proportion share of such Tax)
shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Tax), or employment or
payroll Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon
or related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Tax), or
employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date.



SECTION 5.02 Publicity. None of Sellers, Purchaser nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall make any public announcement or issue any public
communication (including announcements or communications to employees and
interviews with the media) regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or any matter related to the foregoing, without first
obtaining the prior consent of Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except (a) if such announcement
or other communication is required by applicable Law or legal process
(including rules of any national securities exchange), in which case Sellers
or Purchaser, as applicable, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
or legal process (including rules of any national securities exchange), use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such announcement or communication
to Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable (and
in any event prior to any such announcement or communication) and shall
consider in good faith any comments received from Sellers or Purchaser, as
applicable, with respect to such announcement or issuance, and (b) that, for
the avoidance of doubt, either Party and their respective Affiliates may,
without the prior consent of the other Party, issue any non-public release or
statement or otherwise disclose information with respect to this Agreement,
other transaction documents or the transactions (including the Purchase Price
and other terms of the Agreement or other transaction documents) to any of its
or their respective Affiliates, representatives, lenders and current and
potential investors, in each case which are subject to contractual
confidentiality obligations with respect to the information disclosed to them
(whether pursuant to such release or statement or otherwise).



SECTION 5.03 Post-Closing Books and Records.

(a)As of the Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates shall be entitled to retain
copies (at Sellers' sole cost and expense) of any such books, records and
other documents which pertain solely to the ownership or operation of the
Cardinal Companies to the extent that such books, records or other documents
are reasonably required by Sellers or their Affiliates in connection with the
preparation of any Seller's Tax Returns or with any audit thereof or otherwise
required to be retained by Law or applicable regulatory authority. Each of
Sellers and their Affiliates shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, counsel, accountants and other advisors and representatives to,
subject to Section 5.02, maintain in confidence, and not disclose, or use,
except for the purposes set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, any
such retained books, records and other documents, and any other written, oral
or other information relating to the Cardinal Companies obtained by virtue of
Sellers' investment in the Cardinal Companies (the "Sellers' Confidential
Information"). The foregoing shall not prohibit Sellers' or any of their
Affiliate's disclosure of such Sellers' Confidential Information to the extent
required by Law or applicable regulatory authority, in which case Sellers or
their Affiliates, as applicable, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law or applicable regulatory authority, use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide notice of such required disclosure to Purchaser as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event prior to any such required disclosure).
Furthermore, Purchaser acknowledges that in the ordinary course of Sellers'
and their respective Affiliates' businesses, Sellers and such Affiliates may
pursue, acquire, manage and serve on the boards of companies that may be
potential competitors to the Cardinal Companies and, without limiting the
obligations under this Section 5.03(a), this Section 5.03(a) shall not
prohibit or restrict such activities.

(b)Purchaser shall cause the Cardinal Companies to, retain, for at least seven
(7) years after the Closing Date, all books, records and other documents
pertaining to the Cardinal Companies' businesses that relate to the period
prior to the Closing Date, except for Tax Returns and supporting documentation relating to the Cardinal Companies' businesses or the Cardinal
Companies' assets which shall be retained until sixty (60) days after the date
required by applicable Law, and, subject to Sellers' obligation to refrain
from disclosing or making available any proprietary information, any written
or oral communications that are subject to the attorney client privilege and
any documents that are covered by the work product doctrine, to make the same
available after the Closing Date for inspection and copying by Sellers (at
Sellers' sole cost and expense) during regular business hours and at times and
dates mutually acceptable to the Parties without significant disruption to the
Cardinal Companies' businesses and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable
advance notice. At and after the expiration of such period, if Sellers or any
of their Affiliates have previously requested in writing that such books and
records be preserved, Purchaser shall cause the Cardinal Companies to either
preserve such books and records for such reasonable period as may be requested
by Sellers or transfer such books and records to Sellers or their designated
Affiliates, in each case at Sellers' sole cost and expense.



SECTION 5.04 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whether
or not the Closing takes place, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the Party incurring such costs and expenses, including any fees, expenses or
other payments incurred or owed by a Party to any brokers, financial or legal
advisors or comparable other persons retained or employed by such Party in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



SECTION 5.05 Further Actions.



(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to
use reasonable best efforts (except where a different efforts standard is
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in which case such different

cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an
expeditious manner.



(b)The Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or

Entity, (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of
any Governmental Entity, keeping each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including
but not limited to promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications, filings or correspondence between the Parties, or any of
their respective subsidiaries, and any Governmental Entity (or members of
their respective staffs) with respect to the transactions, (v) responding to
and complying with, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any request for
information or documentary material regarding the transactions from any

for the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments
thereon, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed communication to any Governmental Entity (or members of
their respective staffs) to the extent permitted by Law. Purchaser agrees not
to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transaction
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the other party the

(d)Subject to the compliance of the Parties with Section 5.05(b), Purchaser,

whatsoever to the other Party arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any Consents or make any Filings, or because of the termination of, or
default under, any Contract, in each case to the extent such Consents, Filings
or Contracts are listed on Section 3.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
Section 4.03 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule.

Agreement, whether pursuant to Section 10.10(a)(i), Section 10.10(a)(ii),

section of the Company LLC Agreement, required in order to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to remove
the Sellers as members of the Company. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and
agree that the consummation of the Interest Purchase will result in the
application of "Tag-Along Rights" (as defined in the Company LLC Agreement)
for each Category B Member (as defined in the Company LLC Agreement) and that
a notice substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D shall be
provided by Sellers to each Category B Member in accordance with Section 10.16
of the Company LLC Agreement promptly following the execution of this
Agreement. In the event that any Category B Member elects to exercise his, her
or its Tag-Along Rights, Purchaser shall purchase any Membership Interests (as
defined in the Company LLC Agreement) elected to be sold by such Category B
Member as part of the exercise of such Tag-Along Rights in the manner
described in the notice attached hereto as Exhibit D; provided, however,
Purchaser shall not be required to purchase any Membership Interests of such
Category B Member in excess of such Category B Member's Category B Pro Rata
Share.

written request, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with each other in furnishing records, information, oral or written
testimony, oral or written attestations and certifications, and other
assistance in connection with transition matters and any inquiries or
proceedings involving the Cardinal Companies, but excluding any proceedings
arising from disputes among the Parties. Each such requesting Party shall
reimburse such cooperating Party for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
paid or incurred by such cooperating Party as a result of any such requested
cooperation.

until the earlier of (a) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article

their Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,

with, or provide any information to, any Person or group (other than any Party
or any Affiliate, associate or designee of any Party) concerning any proposal
in each case relating to the sale or transfer of all or any substantial part
of the assets, business or equity of any Seller or the Cardinal Companies
(whether through sale, merger or otherwise), including, without limitation for
the sale of the Interests held by the Sellers, other than providing

(a)Purchaser shall cause each Cardinal Company to honor and provide for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date, provisions in its
Organizational Documents concerning the indemnification and exculpation
(including relating to expense advancement) of such Cardinal Company's former

jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause each Cardinal Company to
honor, each of the covenants in this Section 5.08.

(6) years from the Closing Date, a "tail" policy to the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered
by any Cardinal Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) if any Claim is asserted or made within such six
(6)-year period, any insurance required to be maintained under this Section
5.08 shall be continued in respect of such Claim until the final disposition
thereof.



(c)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 5.08 shall survive the consummation of the Interest Purchase
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of the Company. In the event that the Company or any of its
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Company shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.08.

property of any Cardinal Company occurs between the date of this Agreement and
Closing (each such event, a "Casualty Loss"), or (b) a condemnation or taking
under any right of eminent domain of the property of any Cardinal Company
occurs between the date of this Agreement and Closing (each such event, a
"Taking"), and (i) with respect to all such Casualty Losses, if the aggregate
costs to restore, repair or replace any such property subject to such Casualty
Losses to a condition reasonably comparable to its prior condition, less any
insurance proceeds received, or reasonably expected to be received, by any
Cardinal Company or its Affiliates with respect to such Casualty Losses, and
(ii) with respect to all such Takings, the value of the property subject to
such Takings, less any condemnation awards received by any Cardinal Company or
its Affiliates with respect to such Takings, exceeds, in the aggregate between all such Casualty
Losses and all such Takings, $25,000,000, Purchaser may, by notice to Sellers,
terminate this Agreement. If Purchaser exercises its option to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.09, this Agreement will be void and have
no further effect, the provisions of Section 9.02 will apply, and no Party
will have any further right or duty to or claim against the other Party,
except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement. If Purchaser does
not exercise its option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
5.09, then: (a) no Party's rights or obligations shall be affected in any way;
(b) there will not be deemed a breach of representation or warranty by Sellers
as a result of such Casualty Loss or Taking; (c) there will be no change to
the Purchase Price in respect of the Casualty Loss or Taking; and (d) to the
extent Sellers maintain any insurance or are a named insured or additional
insured under any insurance maintained by the operator of the Cardinal
Companies in respect of the Casualty Loss, Sellers shall assign such benefit
to Purchaser or otherwise assign to Purchaser all insurance proceeds payable
as a result of such Casualty Loss.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the Indemnified Purchaser Entities be entitled to aggregate
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Purchase Price (the "Cap"); provided,
however, that no Seller shall be liable for aggregate Indemnifiable Losses in
excess of such Seller's portion of the Purchase Price as set forth in, and
determined in accordance with, Section 2.02; provided, further, that the
foregoing shall not apply to Indemnifiable Losses based on Fraud.



(d)This Section 8.01 is subject to the limitations set forth in Section
7.03(b).



SECTION 8.02 Indemnification by Purchaser.

(a)From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this
Article 8, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Sellers and their respective
officers, directors, employees and Affiliates (collectively, the "Indemnified
Seller Entities") and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any and
all Indemnifiable Losses suffered, paid or incurred by any such Indemnified
Seller Entity and caused by any breach of (i) any of the representations and
warranties made by Purchaser in Article 4 or (ii) any of the covenants or
agreements of Purchaser contained in this Agreement which by their terms are
to be performed after Closing.



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the Indemnified Seller Entities be entitled to aggregate
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Cap; provided, however, that the Cap
shall not apply to Indemnifiable Losses based on Fraud.

 (c)This Section 8.02 is subject to the limitations set forth in Section
7.03(b).



SECTION 8.03 Indemnification Procedures.



(a)If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each,
an "Indemnified Entity") believes that a Claim or other circumstance exists
that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Article 8 (whether or not the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified
Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice
thereof (a "Claim Notice") to the party from which indemnification is sought
(the "Indemnifying Entity") (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such
claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a Claim brought by a Person not a
Party or affiliated with any such Party (a "Third Party") (such Claim by a
Third Party, a "Third Party Claim"), within ten (10) Business Days following
receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim by such Indemnified Entity, or
(ii) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification
is not, or does not relate to, a Third Party Claim, as promptly as practicable
after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise
to such claim for indemnity; provided, that in each case in clauses (i) and
(ii), that the failure to notify or delay in notifying the Indemnifying
Entity, as the case may be, will not relieve the Indemnifying Entity of its
obligations pursuant to this Article 8, except to the extent that such
Indemnifying Entity has suffered actual and material prejudice as a result
thereof. Each Claim Notice shall describe the Claim and the basis of the
Indemnified Entity's claim for indemnification in reasonable detail.

(b)Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of a
Third Party Claim, then, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying
Entity shall be entitled to assume and have sole control over the defense of
such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense and with its own counsel
(such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Entity) if it
gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Entity within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of the Claim Notice from the Indemnified Entity;
provided, however, that any Indemnified Entity is hereby authorized prior to
and during such 30-day period to file any motion, answer or other pleading
that it deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interests of those of
the Indemnifying Entity and not prejudicial to the defense of such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Entity elects to assume and have sole control over
the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the
Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to participate in such defense with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity, at such Indemnified
Entity's sole cost and expense and (ii) subject to Section 8.03(d) below, the
Indemnifying Entity shall control the course of and make all decisions
concerning any such Third Party Claim and expeditiously negotiate a settlement
or compromise of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Entity shall not be entitled to assume and have control over the
defense of the Indemnified Entity if (A) the Indemnified Entity is advised by
its counsel in writing that a conflict of interest under applicable standards
of professional conduct is reasonably likely to exist that precludes effective
joint representation, (B) if such Third Party Claim arises in connection with
a criminal proceeding, indictment or investigation to which the Indemnified
Entity may become a subject thereof, (D) a court in which the Third Party
Claim is pending determines that a conflict of interest exists such that the
Indemnifying Entity's counsel is prohibited by the court from representing the
Indemnified Entity with respect to such Third Party Claim, (E) the Indemnified
Entity and the Indemnifying Entity are or become adverse parties in the Third
Party Claim, (F) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Entity, or (G) the Indemnifying Entity and/or
its counsel fails to actively and diligently conduct such defense of the
Indemnified Entity after notice and reasonable opportunity to cure. If the
Indemnifying Entity does not assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with
the 30-day time period set forth above in accordance with this Section
8.03(b), the Indemnifying Entity shall be deemed to have waived it rights to
later assume defense of such Third Party Claim. 

(c)If, within thirty (30) days of receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any
Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Entity (i)
advises such Indemnified Entity in writing that the Indemnifying Entity shall
not elect to defend, settle or compromise such Third Party Claim, (ii) is not
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim as
provided above or (iii) fails to make such an election in writing, or until
the Indemnifying Entity assumes such defense, then such Indemnified Entity
may, at its option, and at the cost and for the account of the Indemnifying
Entity, and subject to Section 8.03(d) below, defend, settle or otherwise
compromise or pay such Third Party Claim. In such case, the Indemnified Entity
shall have the right with respect to any Third Party Claim for which it is
assuming the defense to choose counsel and make decisions regarding any such
Third Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to
participate in such defense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Entity, at such Indemnifying Entity's sole cost and expense.



(d)No Third Party Claim shall be made the subject of a consent decree or
otherwise settled or compromised by the Indemnifying Entity or the Indemnified
Entity, as applicable, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Entity or the Indemnifying Entity, as applicable, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Whether or not the Indemnifying
Entity has assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Entity will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Entity hereunder for
any settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the
Indemnifying Entity's prior written consent (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



(e)Each Indemnified Entity shall, at the Indemnifying Entity's expense, make
available to the Indemnifying Entity all information reasonably available to
such Indemnified Entity relating to such Third Party Claim, except as may be
prohibited by applicable Law; provided, however, that the Indemnified Entity
shall not be required to disclose to the Indemnifying Entity any documents or
correspondence covered by the attorney client privilege or the work product
doctrine, except pursuant to a joint defense agreement. To the extent that any
documents or correspondence are covered by the attorney client privilege or
the work product doctrine, the Indemnified Entity shall notify the
Indemnifying Entity if the Indemnified Entity seeks to protect such privilege
with respect to third parties. The Indemnified Entity shall disclose to the
Indemnifying Entity the non-privileged contents of any such documents or
correspondence. If requested by the Indemnifying Entity, the Indemnified
Entity and the Indemnifying Entity shall negotiate in good faith a joint
defense agreement with respect to the matter that is the subject of the
privileged communication or work product. In addition, the Parties shall
render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such Third Party Claim. The
Party in charge of the defense shall keep the other Parties fully apprised at
all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with
respect thereto.

(f)If the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is
not, or does not relate to, a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Entity will
have a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of a Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Entity to respond to such claim for indemnification. If the
Indemnifying Entity does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period,
the Indemnifying Entity will be deemed to have rejected such claim for
indemnification, in which event the Indemnified Entity will be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Entity under this Article
8.



SECTION 8.04 Indemnification Generally.

(a)The amount which the Indemnifying Entity is or may be required to pay to
any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this Article 8 shall be reduced
(retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds, Tax benefits actually received in the year in which the relevant
indemnification payment is made or in a prior year or other amounts actually
received by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity related to the related
Indemnifiable Losses. If an Indemnified Entity shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Entity in respect of
Indemnifiable Losses and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or
other amounts in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses, then such Indemnified
Entity shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Entity a sum equal to the
amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received;
provided, that the amount to be repaid by the Indemnified Entity pursuant to
the foregoing shall not exceed the payment received from the Indemnifying
Entity in respect of Indemnifiable Losses.



(b)The indemnification provided in this Article 8, subject to the limitations
set forth in Article 7 and this Article 8, shall be the exclusive post-Closing
remedy available to any Party with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except in the case of Fraud.



(c)To the extent permitted by Law, any indemnity payment under this Agreement
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.



SECTION 8.05 Express Negligence; Limitations on Defense to Certain Claims.



(a)THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE
PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING
ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE, DOCTRINE RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION FOR STRICT
LIABILITY OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT
INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR
PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PERSONS.



(b)TO THE EXTENT THAT AN INDEMNIFIED PURCHASER ENTITY MAKES ANY CLAIMS AGAINST
THE SELLERS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE 8, THE SELLERS MAY NOT ASSERT
AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE AS A DEFENSE, COUNTERCLAIM, OR OTHERWISE THAT
PURCHASER HAS BEEN NEGLIGENT IN CONDUCTING ITS DUE DILIGENCE RELATING TO ANY
ASPECT OF SELLERS, THE CARDINAL COMPANIES AND THE BUSINESS OR THE ASSETS
THEREOF. THE RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS ARTICLE 8 WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY ANY INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED WITH
RESPECT TO, OR ANY KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED (OR CAPABLE OF BEING ACQUIRED) AT ANY
TIME, WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY
OR INACCURACY OF OR COMPLIANCE WITH, ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR
OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CERTIFICATE OR OTHER DOCUMENT OR
INSTRUMENT DELIVERED BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLERS PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.



(c)THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLERS HEREUNDER ARE NOT CONTINGENT UPON THE
ASSERTION OF A CLAIM, DIRECTIVE, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BY A GOVERNMENTAL
ENTITY OR THIRD PARTY. 

ARTICLE 9



Termination



SECTION 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:



(a)at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written agreement of
Purchaser and Sellers;



(b)by either Purchaser or Sellers if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date hereof (the "Outside
Date"); provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.01(b) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;



(c)by either Purchaser or Sellers by giving written notice to the other Party
if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other Action shall not be subject
to appeal or shall have become final and nonappealable;



(d)by either Purchaser or Sellers by giving written notice to the other Party
if there has been a breach by such other Party of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement and, assuming Closing were to occur on
the day on which such written notice is provided pursuant to this Section
9.01(d), such breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the
conditions to Closing of the Party sending such notice (set forth in Section
6.02 or Section 6.03, as applicable) and such breach, if of a character that
is capable of being cured, is not cured by the breaching Party within thirty
(30) days of its receipt of such written notice from the other Party; provided
that (i) Purchaser shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement if
Purchaser is then in breach of this Agreement in a manner which would result
in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions to Closing of the
Sellers set forth in Section 6.03 and (ii) Sellers shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement if Sellers are then in breach of this Agreement in a
manner which would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the
conditions to Closing of Purchaser set forth in Section 6.02; or



(e)by Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.09.



SECTION 9.02 Effect of Termination.

(a)If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 9.01(a) through
(d), such termination shall be without liability of any Party to the other
Parties, except liability for any breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements under this Agreement prior to such termination.



(b)If this Agreement is terminated by either Party pursuant to Section 9.01,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by any Party.

 (c)If this Agreement is terminated, this Agreement shall become null and void
and of no further force and effect, except for the following provisions which
shall survive such termination: Section 5.02 (Publicity); Section 5.04
(Expenses); Section 9.01 (Termination); this Section 9.02 (Effect of
Termination) and Article 10 (Miscellaneous).

SECTION 10.02 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any

circumstance, is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, to the extent valid or enforceable, such provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall, taken together, be considered one and the same agreement. Delivery of

Party may, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party, waive
compliance by any other Party with any term or provision of this Agreement

herein, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.



SECTION 10.05 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement

intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.



SECTION 10.06 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.



SECTION 10.07 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy,
may occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms and that any remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of
this Agreement may be inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



SECTION 10.08 Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the
Parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery or any Federal court located in the State of

of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties
hereto further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document
by U.S. certified mail to such Party's respective address set forth in Section
11.01 shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding
in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of
the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (a) the Delaware Court of
Chancery or (b) any Federal court located in the State of Delaware, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.



SECTION 10.09 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto without
the prior written consent of each of the other Parties. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this
Section 10.09 shall be null and void, ab initio.



SECTION 10.10 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.



SECTION 10.11 Schedules and Exhibits. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to be
and hereby are made a part of this Agreement. Any disclosure in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule corresponding to and
qualifying a specific numbered paragraph or section hereof shall be deemed to
correspond to and qualify any other numbered paragraph or section relating to
such Party; provided that the nature and the relevance of the disclosure is
reasonably apparent from the face and scope of such disclosure. Certain
information set forth in the Schedules is included solely for informational
purposes, is not an admission of liability with respect to the matters covered
by the information, and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item, or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.



[SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW.] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed
as of the day and year first above written.
