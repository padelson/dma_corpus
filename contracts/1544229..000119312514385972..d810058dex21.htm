expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the Stockholder Group shall be liable under this Section&nbsp;6.1(a) for amounts in excess of the

all indemnified parties in each jurisdiction) and the indemnifying party shall be liable for any expenses therefor (including, without limitation, any such reasonable counsel&#146;s fees). If the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or elects not
to, assume the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for each indemnified party with respect to such claim. The indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, compromise or consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement agreement with respect to any action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought under Section&nbsp;6.1(a) or Section&nbsp;6.1(b) (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party thereto), unless such

Sections 6.1(a) or 6.1(b) hereof are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any Claims referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of, the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to such offering of securities.
The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. If, however, the
allocation in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such
relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant
to this Section&nbsp;6.1(c) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the preceding sentences of this Section&nbsp;6.1(c). The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section&nbsp;6.1(b) hereof) any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the Stockholder Group shall be required to make a contribution in excess of the amount received by such person from the
sale of its Registrable Shares in connection with the offering that gave rise to the contribution obligation. </P>
