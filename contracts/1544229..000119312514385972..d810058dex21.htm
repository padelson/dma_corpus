par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Toucan Effective Time (other
than Toucan Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into and

necessary so that at the Toucan Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock Option
shall, automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder thereof,
be converted into a stock option denominated in, or measured, in whole or in
part, by the value of, shares of capital stock of Merger Sub One, (ii) all

who have failed to perfect or who

all shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the East
Effective Time shall be cancelled upon their conversion and shall cease to
exist and each holder of a certificate of Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent
Certificates_ ") and each holder of uncertificated shares of Parent Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except that such
Parent Certificate or uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock shall
represent only the right to receive the East Per Share Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Parent Certificate or uncertificated share immediately prior to the East
Effective Time and any dividends or other distributions to which holders
become entitled upon the surrender of such Parent Certificate in accordance

right to receive a number (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share)
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holdco Common Stock

immediately prior to the East/Toucan Effective Time and any cash in lieu of
fractional

 



7  shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor

following the settlement thereof immediately after the Closing). Prior to the
East Effective Time and after the payment of the Pre-East Merger East Special

Common Stock to be paid in consideration therefor to holders of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.04(f) and any dividends or other distributions
which a holder of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as applicable,

delivery of the Certificates (or, for holders of uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock, only upon delivery of a duly, completely and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as the Company or Holdco, as applicable, may specify subject
to Parents or the Companys reasonable approval, as applicable, prior to the
Closing), together with instructions thereto.

executed in accordance with the instructions thereto or, in the case of
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock, the Letter of Transmittal only,

distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section

Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Parent
or the Company, as applicable, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Holdco Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.03 and in respect of
any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.04(d) may be issued to a transferee, subject to the
restrictions in the Holdco Charter, if the Certificate representing such
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock (or, if such Parent Common Stock
is held in book-entry form or if such Company Common Stock is uncertificated,
proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and

surrender the East Per Share Merger Consideration or Toucan Per Share Merger
Consideration, as applicable, which the holders of shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such
shares pursuant to Section 2.03 (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04(f) and in respect of any dividends
or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.04(d)). No interest will be paid
or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or

declared or made with respect to Holdco Common Stock with a record date after
the East Effective Time or East/Toucan Effective Time, as applicable, shall be

Parent Common Stock held in book-entry form or uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock) with respect to the shares of Holdco Common Stock
issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares will be paid to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.04(f), until the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Parent Common
Stock held in book-entry form or uncertificated shares of Company Common
Stock) in accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of
Parent Common Stock held in book-entry form or uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock), there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificate representing whole shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Holdco Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(f) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the East Effective
Time or East/Toucan Effective Time, as applicable, theretofore paid with

surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Holdco Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Holdco Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms of this Article II
upon conversion of any shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock. From and after the East Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Parent that
were outstanding immediately prior to the East Effective Time, and from and
after the East/Toucan Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or Merger Sub One, as
applicable, that were outstanding immediately prior to the East/Toucan
Effective Time. If, after the East Effective Time, any

 



9  Certificates formerly representing shares of Parent Common Stock (or shares
of Parent Common Stock held in book-entry form) or, after the East/Toucan
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock (or uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock) are presented
to Holdco or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Holdco Common Stock will be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock in the East/Toucan Merger pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(i).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock converted in the East/Toucan Merger pursuant
to Section 2.03(b)(i) who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Holdco Common Stock (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount
multiplied by the volume weighted average of the per share price of Parent
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by Parent and the Company) for the five consecutive trading
days ending on the third Business Day (including the date of the East
Effective Time) prior to the date of the East Effective Time.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock after the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered to
Holdco, and any holder of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Holdco for payment of its claim for East Per Share Merger Consideration or
Toucan Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if applicable, and any dividends and distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II without any
interest thereon.

(h) _No Liability_. None of Holdco, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub One,
Merger Sub Two, Merger Sub Three, Merger Sub Four or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates immediately prior to such time on
which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of,
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Holdco and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Holdco, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Holdco may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, as
applicable, the East Per Share Merger Consideration or Toucan Per Share Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable, and any
dividends and distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

securities, interests, warrants, calls, options or other rights referred to in
clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence. There are no
bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of Parent having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to

12  matters on which stockholders of Parent may vote (collectively, " _Parent
Voting Debt_ "). Other than as contemplated by this Agreement or the

of Parent, Merger Sub Three and Merger Sub Four in accordance with its terms
except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity.

Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to
occur) and would not prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or
delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

SECTION 3.06. _SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Parent has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated
therein) required to be furnished or filed by Parent with the SEC since
January 1, 2013 (such documents, together with any documents filed with the
SEC during such period by Parent on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on
Form 8-K, but excluding the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement
and the Form S-4, being collectively referred to as the " _Parent SEC
Documents_ ").

 

(b) Each Parent SEC Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ")
and the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except,
in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in Parents
consolidated unaudited balance sheet as of June 30, 2014 (or the notes
thereto) as included in the Filed Parent SEC Documents, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since June 30, 2014 in the ordinary course of
business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred as permitted by
this Agreement, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of Parent and the chief financial
officer of Parent (or each former chief executive officer of Parent and each
former chief financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all
applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under
the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Parent
SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true
and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "chief executive officer" and
"chief financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX.
None of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

 



15 (e) Parent maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Parents properties or assets. 

(f) Parent is, and since January 1, 2013 has been, in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and requirements of the NYSE.

(g) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Parent to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
Parent to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

 

(h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
Parent and any of the Parent Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in Parents or such
Parent Subsidiarys published financial statements. 

(i) Since January 1, 2013, none of Parent, Parents independent accountants,
the Parent Board or the audit committee of the Parent Board has received any
oral or written notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Parent, (y) "material weakness"
in the internal controls over financial reporting of Parent or (z) fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of Parent
who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting
of Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

 

(j) None of the Parent Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1,
2013 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act.

SECTION 3.07. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto
is declared effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the
Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement will, at the date it is first
mailed to each of Parents stockholders and the Companys stockholders or at
the time of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by Parent with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

SECTION 3.08. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From January 1, 2014 to
the date of this Agreement, there has not occurred any fact, circumstance,
effect, change, event or development that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. From 

 



16  January 1, 2014 to the date of this Agreement, except for actions taken in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have conducted the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
in the ordinary course in all material respects.

 

SECTION 3.09. _Taxes_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each of
Parent and each Parent Subsidiary (a) has duly and timely filed, or caused to
be filed, taking into account any extensions, all Tax Returns required to have
been filed by it and such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete and (b)
has duly and timely paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it (including
any Taxes required to be withheld from amounts owing to any employee,
creditor, stockholder or other third party), except in each case of
clauses (a) and (b), with respect to matters contested in good faith in
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP in the Parent SEC Documents.

 

SECTION 3.10. _Intended Tax Treatment_. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of the existence
of any fact that is reasonably likely to prevent or impede either the East
Merger or the East/Toucan Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

SECTION 3.11. _Benefits Matters; ERISA Compliance_.

 

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date

401(a) of the Code have been the subject of, have timely applied for or have
not been eligible to apply for, as of the date of this Agreement,
determination letters from the IRS to the effect that such Parent Benefit
Plans and the trusts created thereunder are so qualified, and no such
determination letter has been revoked nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, has
revocation been threatened, nor has any such Parent Benefit Plan been amended
since the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor
in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(c)_ of the Parent

17   _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has, or since January 1, 2010 had, contributed to, or
been required to contribute to, any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Section 4971 of
the Code (a " _Parent Pension Plan_ ") or has any liability (including
"withdrawal liability" within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA) with respect
to, any Multiemployer Plan. Except for matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (i) no Parent Pension Plan has failed to meet any
"minimum funding standards", as applicable (as such terms are defined in
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, (iii)
none of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, any officer of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or any Parent Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including
the Parent Pension Plans, any trust created thereunder or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975

subject Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any officer of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary to the Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by the
Code, ERISA or other applicable Law, (iv) no Parent Pension Plans or related
trusts have been terminated, nor is there any intention or expectation to
terminate any Parent Pension Plans or related trusts, (v) no Parent Pension
Plans or related trusts are the subject of any proceeding by any Person,
including any Governmental Entity, that would reasonably be expected to result
in a termination of any Parent Pension Plan or related trust, and (vi) there
has not been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043
of ERISA) with respect to any Parent Pension Plan during the last six years as
to which the 30-day advance-notice requirement has not been waived.

(d) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan (including any "health reimbursement account"), such Parent
Benefit Plan (including any Company Benefit Plan covering retirees or other
former employees) may be amended to reduce benefits or limit the liability of
Parent or Parent Subsidiaries or terminated, in each case, without material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries on or at any time after the
East/Toucan Effective Time.

(e) Except as set forth in  _Section 3.11(e)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, no Parent Benefit Plan provides health, medical or other welfare
benefits after retirement or other termination of employment (other than for
continuation coverage required under Section 4980(B)(f) of the Code or
applicable Law where the cost thereof is borne entirely by the former employee
(or his or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries)).

 

(f) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse

Effect, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened claims
by or on behalf of any participant in any of Parent Benefit Plans, or
otherwise involving any such Parent Benefit Plan or the assets of any Parent
Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for benefits.

(h) Except as provided by this Agreement or pursuant to applicable Law, and
except as set forth in _Section 3.11(h)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
none of the execution and delivery of the this Agreement, the obtaining of the
Parent Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Transactions (alone or
in conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment
on or following the East/Toucan Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current
or former director, officer, employee or consultant of Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries to any compensation or benefit, (B) accelerate the time

the Company of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "). The
Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to
the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of
the Company Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not

nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure

Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent, prior to

did not result from a breach of this Section 5.03(a), Parent, and its
Representatives at the request of Parent may, subject to compliance with
Section 5.03(c), (x) furnish information with respect to Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Parent Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to the Company or is provided to the Company prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement and containing "standstill"
provisions that are not less restrictive to such Person than the "standstill"
provisions contained in the Exclusivity Agreement are to the Company (provided
that Parent promptly provides to the Company a copy of such confidentiality
agreement), and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such
Parent Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and only
with, the Person or Persons making such Parent Takeover Proposal (and such
Persons or Persons Representatives and financing sources). Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.03(a) by any Affiliates of Parent or any of its or their
Representatives shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by Parent.

 

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.03, neither the Parent Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
the Company), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse
to the Company), the Parent Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any Parent Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, or
propose publicly to adopt, or allow Parent or any of its Affiliates to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement or arrangement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 5.03(a)) relating to any Parent Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board may (1) make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Intervening Event or (2) (A)
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01(f), in case of either (A) or (B), following
receipt of a Parent Takeover Proposal

 



47  after the execution of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of
Section 5.03(a) and that the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal, in each case
referred to in the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), only if the Parent Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to
exercise its rights to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(f) unless (i)
Parent delivers to the Company a written notice (a " _Parent Notice_ ")
advising the Company that the Parent Board intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor, including, in the case of a Parent
Intervening Event, summarizing such Parent Intervening Event and, in the case
of a Superior Parent Proposal, summarizing the terms and conditions of any
Superior Parent Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Parent Board (including the identity of the party making such Superior Parent
Proposal) and providing the Company a copy of the most current version of any
proposed definitive agreement(s) with respect to such Superior Parent
Proposal and (ii) on or after the Applicable Time on the third (3rd) Business
Day following the day on which the Company received the Parent Notice (it
being understood that for purposes of calculating such three (3) Business
Days, the first Business Day shall be the first Business Day after the date of
such receipt), Parent reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that (A)
the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as a result thereof
would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law and (B) in the case of a Parent Intervening Event, such Parent
Intervening Event remains in effect and, in the case of a Superior Parent
Proposal, such Superior Parent Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Parent Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material amendment to any term of such Superior
Parent Proposal shall require a new Parent Notice and a new two (2) Business
Day period (it being understood that any such two (2) Business Day period
shall be calculated in the same manner as the initial three (3) Business Day
period)). In determining whether to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(f), the
Parent Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company in response to a Parent Notice or otherwise,
and if requested by the Company, Parent shall engage in good faith
negotiations with the Company regarding any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of material developments with respect to any Parent Intervening
Event.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.03, Parent shall, within 24 hours of the receipt
thereof, advise the Company in writing of any Parent Takeover Proposal and,
promptly following Parent obtaining Knowledge of the receipt thereof, any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Parent Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of
the Person making any such Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and the material
details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any Parent
Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit Parent from
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall Parent or the Parent Board
or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action
prohibited by Section 5.03(b) and (ii) any public disclosure made by or on
behalf of Parent that refers to a Parent Takeover Proposal will be deemed to
be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section
8.01(e)) unless the Parent Board expressly reaffirms the
Parent Recommendation.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Parent Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) from a third party (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange,

business or assets of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries representing 20% or
more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any
Person) or group of Persons of securities (or options, rights or warrants to

representing 20% or more of the total outstanding voting power of Parent, (iv)
transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person)
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially
owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the
Parent Common Stock or (v) combination of the foregoing (in each case, other
than the Transactions).

" _Superior Parent Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer from a third
party (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) that, if
consummated, would result in such Person (or, in the case of a direct merger
between such Person and Parent, the stockholders of such Person) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Parent Common
Stock or all or substantially all the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith judgment of the Parent
Board (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), if consummated, would result in a
transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to
the stockholders of Parent than the Transactions (taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of, and the likelihood, timing of, and regulatory
requirements in connection with, completion of, such offer and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
the Company in response to such Superior Parent Proposal or otherwise)).

which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Parent Board or any
member thereof on the date of this Agreement), which event, fact,
circumstance, development, occurrence, magnitude or material consequences
becomes known to the Parent Board or any member thereof prior to obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that none of the following
will constitute a Parent Intervening Event: (i) any action taken by any party
hereto pursuant to and in compliance with the affirmative covenants set forth
in Section 6.03 of this Agreement, (ii) changes in the market price or
trading volume of Parents securities or changes in Parents credit ratings
(except that this clause (ii) will not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, effect, event, circumstance, development or
occurrence underlying such change has resulted in or contributed to a Parent
Intervening Event), (iii) the receipt, existence of or terms of a Parent
Takeover Proposal (except that this clause (iii) will not prevent or
otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, event, circumstance,
development or occurrence underlying the receipt, existence of or terms of
such Parent Takeover Proposal has resulted in or contributed to a Parent
Intervening Event) and (iv) any events relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare, and Parent shall, or

be sent to the stockholders of Parent relating to the Parent Stockholders
Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") and (ii) a consent solicitation statement of the

 



49  Company to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the

and Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall, or shall cause
Merger Sub Three to, file with the SEC, the Form S-4, in which the Proxy

Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub Three to, use its respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement to
comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after it is filed with the SEC and to maintain the effectiveness
of the Form S-4 as long as is necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each
of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person

one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Parent shall, or shall cause Merger
Sub Three to, use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Form
S-4 or Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the
other an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii)
shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by
the other and (iii) shall not file or mail, or cause to be filed or mailed,
such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the
other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub Three to, advise the Company,
promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the
Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension
of the qualification of the Merger Consideration for offering or sale in any

reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub
Three to, also take any other action (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable state securities or
"blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with
the Transactions.

 

(b) If prior to the East/Toucan Effective Time, any event occurs with respect
to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to
other information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement or the Form S-4, which is required to
be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement or the Form S-4, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of such event, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Solicitation Statement or the Form S-4 and,
as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to Parents stockholders and the Companys
stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(b) shall limit the obligations
of any party under Section 6.01(a).

(c) If prior to the East/Toucan Effective Time, any event occurs with respect
to the Company, or any change occurs with respect to other information

an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation
Statement or the Form S-4, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such
event, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with
the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement or the Form S-4 and, as
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to Parents stockholders and the Companys stockholders. Nothing
in this Section 6.01(c) shall limit the obligations of any party under
Section 6.01(a).

 



50 (d) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Proxy
Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement to be mailed to Parents
stockholders and to hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act
and (ii) subject to Section 5.03(b), solicit the Parent Stockholder Approval.
Parent shall, through the Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders that
they give the Parent Stockholder Approval and shall include the Parent
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement, except
to the extent that the Parent Board shall have made a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.03(b). Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01(d), if following the dissemination
of the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement, either Parent or the
Company reasonably determines in good faith that the Parent Stockholder
Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the scheduled Parent Stockholders
Meeting, then on a single occasion and prior to the vote contemplated having
been taken, Parent shall have the right to postpone or adjourn the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, provided that in no event shall the Parent Stockholders
Meeting (as so postponed or adjourned) be held on a date that is more than 30
days after the date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting was originally
scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable
Law). Parent agrees that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01, its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01
will not be affected by the making of any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
by the Parent Board or the occurrence of a Parent Intervening Event.

(e) The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement
included in the Form S-4 to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act and submit this Agreement for adoption by the Companys
stockholders via written consent as soon as practicable after the Form S-4
becomes effective and, subject to the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall,
through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the
Company Stockholder Approval and shall include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement, subject to the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act and the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation
Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders, Merger Sub One shall call
and hold a meeting of its sole stockholder for the purpose of submitting this
Agreement for adoption by such stockholder.

 

SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents Representatives reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance notice, during the period from the date of

or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

(i) shall not be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably
disrupt the operations of the Company, (ii) may withhold any document or
information the disclosure of which would cause a violation of any agreement
to which the Company or such Company Subsidiary is a party ( _provided_ that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure) and (iii)
may withhold any document or information the disclosure of which would be
reasonably likely to risk a loss of legal privilege ( _provided_ that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that would not be
reasonably likely to risk a loss of legal privilege). If any material is
withheld by the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall, to the extent possible without violating an agreement or
risking a loss of legal privilege, inform Parent as to the general nature of
what is being withheld. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section
6.02(a) shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated July 9, 2014

51 (b) Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Parent Subsidiaries to, afford to the Company and to the Companys
Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the East/Toucan
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and records and, during such period, Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Parent Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the Company all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including for purposes of any business planning

, that Parent (i) shall not be required to afford such access if it would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of Parent, (ii) may withhold any document
or information the disclosure of which would cause a violation of any
agreement to which Parent or such Parent Subsidiary is a party ( _provided_
that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure) and (iii) may
withhold any document or information the disclosure of which would be
reasonably likely to risk a loss of legal privilege ( _provided_ that Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
(or as much of it as possible) in a manner that would not be reasonably likely
to risk a loss of legal privilege). If any material is withheld by Parent
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, to the
extent possible without violating an agreement or risking a loss of legal
privilege, inform the Company as to the general nature of what is being
withheld. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02(b) shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 6.03. _Required Actions_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary or advisable to cause the conditions to closing of the Transactions
to be satisfied and consummate and make effective, in each case, as soon as

Transactions.

(b) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), the Company and
the Company Board and Parent and the Parent Board shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably appropriate to

becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this
Agreement or the Transactions, take all action reasonably appropriate to

consummation of the Transactions in order to obtain all such required Consents
from such Governmental Entities, in each case with respect to the Mergers, so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and in any
event no later than the End Date. To the extent necessary in order to
accomplish the foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth in Section
6.03(f), the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to jointly negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order, condition or approval or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation of,
or requirements or undertakings with respect to the conduct by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries of, any portion of the
business, properties or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the

the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, each
taken as a whole. If the actions taken by Parent and the Company pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence do not result in the conditions set forth
in Sections 7.01(c) and (d) being satisfied, then, during the term of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best

(e) In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Parent and the Company shall:

(i) make or cause to be made as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any

and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and secure
the participation of, the other in connection with any such registration,
declaration, submission, notice, filing or communication;

(including a "second request" under the HSR Act), and not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with such Governmental
Entities or other authorities not to consummate any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed;

(v) prepare and submit, in a form acceptable to the cognizant security agency,
to the Defense Security Service (" _DSS_ ") of the United States Department

_provided_ , that each of Parent and the Company shall have approval rights
over the content of all related communications, filings and notifications and
shall be entitled to participate in all related discussions, where acceptable
to the cognizant security agency; and

(vi) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend
any meeting, or engage in any conversation with any Governmental Entity in
respect of the Transactions (including with respect to any of the actions
referred to in Section 6.03(d) and in this Section 6.03(e)) without the other,
(B) to the extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior
notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity from

respect to this Agreement and the Mergers, subject to redaction of
competitively sensitive information, valuation material or
information subject to attorney client privilege.

(f) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein but subject to the proviso
of the second sentence of Section 6.03(d), the provisions of this Section
6.03 shall not be construed to require the Company, Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries to offer, take, commit to or accept any action, restrictions or
limitations of or on the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or
to permit such actions, restrictions or limitations without the prior written
consent of Parent (in the case of such offerings, taking, commitments,
acceptances or permissions by the Company) or the Company (in the case of
such offerings, takings, commitments, acceptances, or permissions by Parent),
as applicable, if such actions, restrictions or limitations, individually or
in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

SECTION 6.04. _Stock Plans_.

 

(a) Prior to the East Effective Time, Parent or the Parent Board, as
applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take all other actions necessary to
effectuate the actions set forth in Section 6.04 of the Parent Disclosure

pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each,
together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, a "
_Company Indemnified Party_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the East/Toucan Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer
of another Person, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the East/Toucan Effective
Time as provided in their respective 

 



54  certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational
documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement, a
true and complete copy of which agreement has been provided by the Company to
Parent prior to the date hereof, to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the East/Toucan Merger and continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six
years from the East/Toucan Effective Time, Holdco shall, and shall cause
Toucan Surviving LLC to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any Company
Subsidiarys articles of incorporation and by-laws or other organization
documents in effect immediately prior to the East/Toucan Effective Time or in
any agreement, a true and complete copy of which agreement has been provided
by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof, to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, in each case in effect immediately prior
to the East/Toucan Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or advancement
of expenses provisions of the Toucan Surviving LLCs certificate of formation
or limited liability company agreement in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individual who immediately before the
East/Toucan Effective Time was entitled to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (each, an " _Action_ ") pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action
or resolution of such claim.

(b) For a period of six years from the East/Toucan Effective Time, Holdco
shall cause to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance in effect as of the East/Toucan Effective Time by the Company and
its Subsidiaries from a carrier with the same or better credit ratings to the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance policy carrier and on terms and conditions not less favorable to the
insured Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that
occurred on or before the East/Toucan Effective Time, except that in no event
shall Holdco be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess
of 250% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such
insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the " _Maximum Amount_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such insurance can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Maximum Amount, Holdco shall obtain the most
advantageous policy of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, the
Company may in its discretion purchase, and Parent or Holdco, as applicable,
may in its discretion purchase (or cause to be purchased) if the
Company declines to do so, a "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy covering the six-year
period from and after the East/Toucan Effective Time from a carrier with the
same or better credit ratings to the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy carrier and on
terms and conditions not less favorable to the insured Persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims
arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the
East/Toucan Effective Time,  _provided_ that without the Parents or Holdcos
consent, as applicable, the cost of such "tail" policy shall not exceed the
Maximum Amount.

 

(c) In the event that Holdco, Toucan Surviving LLC or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Holdco or Toucan Surviving LLC shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Holdco or Toucan Surviving Company, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.05 shall (i) survive consummation of the
Mergers, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (iii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

such other time or times reasonably requested by Companys Counsel or Parents
Counsel), and signed by an officer of Parent containing customary
representations of Parent (collectively, the " _368(a) Tax Representation

appropriate to enable Deloitte Tax LLP to render the opinion described in
Section 7.02(d)(ii) and Section 7.03(d)(ii).

to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or

delivered by the Company or Parent, as applicable, pursuant to Section
6.06(b), in each case as of the date the applicable opinion is given.

SECTION 6.07. _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable Law, Parent
shall give the Company the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any litigation by a holder of securities of, or lender to,
Parent against Parent or its directors or officers relating to

written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any litigation against the Company or its directors or officers by a holder of
securities of, or lender to, the Company relating to the Transactions and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Without limiting in any way the parties obligations under Section
6.03, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate, shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to cooperate, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers,
employees, agents, legal counsel, financial advisors, independent
auditors, and other advisors and representatives to cooperate in the defense
against such litigation by a holder of securities of, or lender to, the
Company or of Parent, as applicable.

 

SECTION 6.08. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the East/Toucan Effective Time,

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Holdco to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



56 SECTION 6.09. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to develop
a joint communications plan and to consult with each other before issuing, and
give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release
or other public statements with respect to the Transactions, and not to issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (in such event, with prompt notice to the other parties
hereto). The Company, Merger Sub One and Parent agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences
of this Section 6.09, Parent and the Company may make any oral or written
public announcements, releases or statements without complying with the
foregoing requirements if the substance of such announcements, releases or
statements, was publicly disclosed and previously subject to the foregoing
requirements.

SECTION 6.10. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall, or shall cause Merger
Sub Three to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Holdco
Common Stock to be issued in the East Merger and the East/Toucan Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 6.11. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Holdco agrees that, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and

of their Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Holdco or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing Date (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall be
provided with welfare and retirement benefits (for the avoidance of doubt
excluding salary, cash bonus and other incentive compensation, stock purchase
plans and equity or equity-based plans) that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the welfare and retirement benefits (for the avoidance of
doubt excluding salary, cash bonus and other incentive compensation, stock
purchase plans and equity or equity-based plans) that were provided prior to
the Closing Date to such Continuing Employee.

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, seniority participation and vesting (but not
for purposes of benefit accrual (i) to the extent that such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits and (ii) under defined benefit pension
plans) under the compensation and benefit arrangements that Continuing
Employees become eligible to participate in, service with or credited by the
Parent, the Company and any of their Subsidiaries shall be treated as service
with Holdco and its Affiliates. For the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs, Holdco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
welfare benefit plans to which Continuing Employees become eligible to
participate in to (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and
limitations for preexisting conditions or insurability (except for pre-

were applicable, under welfare benefit arrangements maintained by the Parent,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries), and (ii) cause any deductible,
coinsurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the
Continuing Employees and their dependents under welfare benefit arrangements
prior to the Closing Date to be credited to such Continuing Employees under
welfare benefit arrangements maintained by Holdco and its Affiliates following
the Closing Date, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance,
or maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such Continuing Employees.

their Subsidiaries and any successor thereto to honor, fulfill and discharge
their obligations under the Parent Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Plans, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans.

treated as an amendment of any particular Parent Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) obligate Holdco or any of its Affiliates to (x) maintain
any particular Parent Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan or (y) retain the
employment of any 

 



57  particular employee of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.
This Section 6.11 shall inure exclusively to the benefit of, and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing
in this Section 6.11, express or implied, is intended to confer on any person
other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities.

amount

 



65  pursuant to Section 8.02(b) or 8.02(c) and, in order to obtain such payment,
the Company commences an action that results in a Judgment in its favor for

or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of
any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by
Parent shall require the approval of the stockholders of Parent unless

shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company unless such
approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an

Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,

acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, to the

arises out of this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not

judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) (a) that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Parent Debt Financing Sources or the Company

Financing, the Incremental Debt Financing or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Parent Debt

claim described in clause (a) shall be governed by the laws of the State of
New York.

SECTION 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or

and obligations arising under this Agreement to another newly formed,
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent with substantially identical ownership,
capitalization and organizational documents, which subsidiary shall be
substituted for Merger Sub Three or Merger Sub Four, as the case may be, for
all purposes hereunder, and Merger Sub One may cause Merger Sub Two to assign
all of such Persons rights, interests and obligations arising under this
Agreement to another newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub One
with substantially identical ownership, capitalization and organizational
documents, which subsidiary shall be substituted for Merger Sub Two, as the
case may be, for all purposes hereunder. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 9.10. _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. 

SECTION 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

Engility Holdings, Inc.

The Certificate of Incorporation of [Holdco] was originally filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 23, 2014 (the "
_Original Certificate_ "), under the name New East Holdings, Inc. This Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ ") has been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242, 245
and 228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _GCL_
"). This Certificate of Incorporation amends, restates, and integrates the
provisions of the Original Certificate and, upon filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Sections 103, 242 and 245 of
the GCL, shall supersede the Original Certificate and shall, as it may
thereafter be amended in accordance with its terms and applicable law, be the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.

_FIRST:_ The name of the corporation is [HOLDCO] (hereinafter referred to as
the " _Corporation_ ").

_SECOND:_ The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the
State of Delaware is The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street,
Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware, 19801. The name of the registered
agent of the Corporation at that address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

 _THIRD:_ The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

_FOURTH_ : A. The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 200,000,000, consisting of
175,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value one cent ($.01) per share (the "
_Common Stock_ ") and 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value one cent
($.01) per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ ").

B. The board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed
by law, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in series,
and by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of the State of
Delaware (such certificate being hereinafter referred to as a " _Preferred
Stock Designation_ "), to establish from time to time the number of shares to
be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers,
preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and any
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The number of authorized
shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a
vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a
vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the terms of any Preferred
Stock Designation.

C. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to
one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the
Corporation for their vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise
required by law (meaning, here and hereinafter, as required from time to time
by the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Corporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation relating to any
series of Preferred Stock)), holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to
vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any
Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that
relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred
Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately
or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to
vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any
Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). _FIFTH:_ The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further
definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its directors and stockholders:

 

A. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the board of directors. In addition to the powers and
authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this Certificate of
Incorporation or the bylaws of the Corporation, the directors are hereby
empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may
be exercised or done by the Corporation.

B. The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written
ballot unless the bylaws so provide.

C. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any
action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in
writing by such stockholders.

 

D. Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by
the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority
of the Whole Board. For purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation, the
term " _Whole Board_ " shall mean the total number of authorized directors
whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized
directorships.

E. An annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed
those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as
may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, if any, on
such date, and at such time as shall be fixed exclusively by resolution of the
board of directors. 

_SIXTH:_ A. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, and
subject to that certain Stockholders Agreement entered into between [], dated
as of [] (as amended from time to time, the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "), a
copy of which will be provided to any stockholder of the Corporation upon
request, so long as such agreement remains in effect, the number of directors
shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the board of directors
pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. The
directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock under specified circumstances, shall be divided into three
classes, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the
Corporations first annual meeting of stockholders, the term of office of the
second class to expire at the Corporations second annual meeting of
stockholders and the term of office of the third class to expire at the
Corporations third annual meeting of stockholders, with each director to
hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders, (i) directors elected to
succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of
office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after
their election, with each director to hold office until his or her successor
shall have been duly elected and qualified, and (ii) if authorized by a
resolution of the board of directors, directors may be elected to fill any
vacancy on the board of directors, regardless of how such vacancy shall have
been created. The board of directors may assign members of the board already
in office to such classes at the time that the classification of the board
becomes effective.

B. A majority of the Whole Board shall constitute a quorum for all
purposes at any meeting of the board of directors, and, except as otherwise
expressly required by law, all matters shall be determined by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum
is present.

 

C. Subject to Section 3.4 of the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the
Stockholders Agreement is in effect) and the rights of the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any
vacancies in the board of directors resulting from death,
resignation, disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall,
unless otherwise required by law or by resolution of the board of directors,
be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in office, though less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and
directors so chosen shall serve for a term expiring at the annual meeting of
stockholders

 



2  at which the term of office of the class to which they have been chosen
expires, with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall
have been duly elected and qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of
directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

D. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors
and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the
bylaws of the Corporation.

 

E. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding, any director, or the entire board of directors, may be removed
from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of
all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.

 

 _SEVENTH:_ Subject to Section 10.13 of the Stockholders Agreement (for so
long as the Stockholders Agreement is in effect), the board of directors is
expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, the bylaws
of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the bylaws of the
Corporation by the board of directors shall require the approval of
a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to
adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding any other provision of law which might otherwise permit a
lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any
class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law, the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power
of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required
to adopt, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, any provision of the bylaws of
the Corporation or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.

_EIGHTH:_ A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived
an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is
amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at
the time of such repeal or modification.

_NINTH:_ Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the
sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought
on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of
a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware
General Corporation Law or the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation or
bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs
doctrine except as to each of (i) through (iv) above, for any claim as to
which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party
not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the
indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is
vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject
matter jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring
any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to
have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article NINTH.

 

 _TENTH:_ The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision,
in whole or in part, contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the
manner prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware and all rights
conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding any 

 



3  other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law
that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any
vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this corporation
required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as
a single class, shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, in whole or in
part, this Article TENTH, Sections C, D or E of Article FIFTH, Article SIXTH,
Article SEVENTH or Article EIGHTH, or to adopt any provision inconsistent
therewith or herewith.

_ELEVENTH_. _Restrictions on Transfer and Ownership_.

 

A. _Purpose_. It is in the best interests of the Corporation and its
shareholders that certain restrictions on the transfer or other disposition
of Corporation Securities (including shares of Common Stock) be established,
as more fully set forth in this Article ELEVENTH, as any such transfer or
disposition may threaten the preservation of certain tax attributes. 

B. _Definitions_. As used in this Article ELEVENTH, the following capitalized
terms shall have the following respective meanings (and any references to any
portions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T shall include any successor
provisions):

 

 _"Acquire"_ means the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of ownership of
Corporation Securities by any means, including, without limitation, (i) the
exercise of any rights under any option, warrant, convertible security, pledge
or other security interest or similar right to acquire Corporation Securities,
(ii) the entering into of any swap, hedge or other arrangement that results
in the acquisition of any of the economic benefits of ownership of Corporation
Securities, or (iii) any other acquisition or transaction treated under
Section 382 of the Code as a direct or indirect acquisition (including the
direct or indirect acquisition of an ownership interest in a Substantial
Holder) of ownership of such Corporation Securities. The terms "Acquires" and
"Acquisition" shall have the same meaning,  _mutatis mutandis_.

_"Code"_ means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to
time. 

_"Corporation Securities"_ means (i) shares of Common Stock, (ii) any other
interests that would be treated as "stock" of the Corporation pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(f)(18), and (iii) warrants, rights or
options (including within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.382-4(d)(9)) to purchase Corporation Securities.

_"Disposition"_ means, with respect to any Person other than the Corporation,
the sale, transfer, exchange, assignment, liquidation, conveyance, pledge,
abandonment, or other disposition or transaction treated under Section 382 of
the Code as a direct or indirect disposition or transfer (including the
disposition of an ownership interest in a Substantial Holder). A
"Disposition" also shall include the creation or grant of an option (including
an option within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-4(d)(9)).

 

 _"Effective Date"_ means the effective time of this Certificate of
Incorporation.

 

 _"Board"_ means the board of directors of [HOLDCO].

 

 _"Percentage Stock Ownership"_ means percentage stock ownership as determined
in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(g), (h) (without
regard to the rule that treats stock of an entity as to which the constructive
ownership rules apply as no longer owned by that entity), (j) and (k).

 

 _"Person"_ means an individual, corporation, estate, trust, association,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture or similar organization
or "entity" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3
(including, without limitation, any group of Persons treated as a single
entity under such regulation); provided, however, that a Person shall not
mean a Public Group.

" _Public Group_ " has the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.382-2T(f)(13).

_"Substantial Holder"_ means a Person (including, without limitation, any
group of Persons treated as a single "entity" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.382-3) holding, owning, or having any

 



4  right in Corporation Securities, whether as of the Effective Date or
thereafter, representing a Percentage Stock Ownership (including indirect and
constructive ownership, as determined under applicable Treasury Regulations)
in the Corporation of at least [4.9%].

_"Tax Benefits"_ means the net operating loss carryovers, capital loss
carryovers, general business credit carryovers, alternative minimum tax credit
carryovers and foreign tax credit carryovers, as well as any "net unrealized
built-in loss" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, of the
Corporation or any direct or indirect subsidiary thereof.

_"Transfer"_  means any direct or indirect Acquisition or Disposition of
Corporation Securities.

_"Treasury Regulation" _ means any Treasury regulation, in effect from time
to time, promulgated under the Code.

C. _Ownership Limitations_.

(1) From and after the Effective Date, no Person shall be permitted to make a
Transfer, whether in a single transaction (with any transactions occurring on
the same day being treated as a single transaction) or series of related
transactions, and any such purported Transfer will be _void ab initio_ , (a)
to the extent that after giving effect to such purported Transfer (i) the
purported transferee or any other Person by reason of the purported
transferees Acquisition would become a Substantial Holder, or (ii) the
Percentage Stock Ownership of a Person that, prior to giving effect to the
purported Transfer (or any series of Transfers of which such Transfer is a
part), is a Substantial Holder would be increased, or (b) if the purported
transferor is a Substantial Holder before giving effect to such purported
Transfer (any such purported transfer described in clause (a) or (b), a "
_Prohibited Transfer_ ").

 

(2) The restrictions set forth in Section C(1) of this Article ELEVENTH shall
not apply to a proposed Transfer if (a) the transfer restrictions are waived
in accordance with Article IV of the Stockholders Agreement or such Transfer
is permitted pursuant to Article IV of the Stockholders Agreement or (b) the
transferor or the transferee obtains approval of the proposed Transfer from a
majority of the Board (at a meeting of the Board or by written consent of the
Board). When a Person being granted a waiver pursuant to Section C(2)(b) of
this Article ELEVENTH is a member of the Stockholder Group (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement), any Investor (as defined in the Stockholders
Agreement), or any Partner (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement),
references in this Article ELEVENTH to "the Board" should be read to refer to
a committee of the Board consisting solely of Independent Directors (as
defined in the Stockholders Agreement). As a condition to granting its consent
pursuant to Section C(2)(b) of this Article ELEVENTH, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Board may, in its sole discretion, require and/or
obtain (at the expense of the transferor and/or transferee) such
representations from the transferor and/or transferee, such opinions of
counsel to be rendered by counsel selected by (or acceptable to) the Board,
and such other advice, in each case as to such matters as the Board determines
in its sole discretion is appropriate.

 

D. _Treatment of Excess Securities_.

 

(1) To the fullest extent permitted by law, no employee or agent of the
Corporation shall record any Prohibited Transfer, and the purported
transferee of a Prohibited Transfer (the " _Purported Transferee_ ") shall not
be recognized as a stockholder of the Corporation for any purpose whatsoever
in respect of the Corporation Securities that are the subject of the
Prohibited Transfer (the " _Excess Securities_ "). Until the Excess Securities
are acquired by another Person in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited
Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall not, to the fullest extent of the
law, be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to any rights of
stockholders of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to
vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether
liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof. Once the Excess Securities have
been acquired in a Transfer that is in accordance with this Section D of this
Article ELEVENTH and is not a Prohibited Transfer, such Corporation Securities
shall cease to be Excess Securities. For this purpose, any Transfer of Excess
Securities not in accordance with the provisions of this Section D of this
Article ELEVENTH shall also be a Prohibited Transfer.

 



5 (a) To the fullest extent of the law, the Corporation may require as a
condition to the registration of the Transfer of any Corporation Securities
or the payment of any dividend or distribution on any Corporation Securities
(in each case, other than any Corporation Securities that are subject to a
Transfer pursuant to a waiver of the transfer restrictions in accordance with
Article IV of the Stockholders Agreement or that are otherwise subject to such
transfer restrictions) that the proposed Transferee or payee furnish to the
Corporation all information, to the fullest extent of the law, reasonably
requested by the Corporation with respect to all the direct or indirect
ownership interests in such Corporation Securities. The Corporation may make
such arrangements or issue such instructions to its stock transfer agent as
may be determined by the Board to be necessary or advisable to implement this
Section D of this Article ELEVENTH, including, without limitation, authorizing
such transfer agent to require an affidavit from a Purported Transferee
regarding such Persons actual and constructive ownership of stock and other
evidence that a Transfer will not be prohibited by this Article ELEVENTH as a
condition to registering any transfer.

 

(2) If the Board determines that a Prohibited Transfer has occurred, the
Prohibited Transfer and, if applicable, the registration of such Prohibited
Transfer, shall be void _ab initio_ and have no legal effect and, upon written
demand by the Corporation, the Purported Transferee, to the fullest extent of
the law, shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other
evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported
Transferees possession or control, together with any dividends or other
distributions that were received by the Purported Transferee from the
Corporation with respect to the Excess Securities (the " _Prohibited
Distributions_ "), to an agent designated by the Board (the " _Agent_ ").

 

(a) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Section C(1)(a) of this
Article ELEVENTH, the Agent shall thereupon identify and sell to a buyer or
buyers, the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more arms-length
transactions (including over a national securities exchange on which the
Corporation Securities may be traded, if possible); provided, however, that
the Agent, in its sole discretion, shall effect such sale or sales in an
orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any
specific time frame if, in the Agents discretion, such sale or sales would
disrupt the market for the Corporation Securities or otherwise would
adversely affect the value of the Corporation Securities; provided further
that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited Transfer. If the Purported
Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the
Corporations demand to surrender the Excess Securities to the Agent, the
Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for
the Agent, and shall be required, to the fullest extent of the law,
to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and the proceeds of
such sale, except to the extent the Corporation grants written permission to
the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sale proceeds not
exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from
the Agent pursuant to Section D(3) of this Article ELEVENTH if the Agent,
rather than the Purported Transferee, had resold the Excess Securities; or

 

(b) In the case of a Prohibited Transfer described in Section C(1)(b) of this
Article ELEVENTH, the purported transferor of Excess Securities in such
Prohibited Transfer (the " _Purported Transferor_ ") shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, deliver to the Agent the sale proceeds from the
Prohibited Transfer (in the form received, i.e., whether in cash or
other property), and the Agent shall thereupon identify and sell any non-cash
consideration to a buyer or buyers in one or more arms-length transactions
(including over a national securities exchange, if possible). If the Purported
Transferee is determinable (other than with respect to a transaction entered
into through the facilities of a national securities exchange), the Agent
shall, to the extent possible, return the Prohibited Distributions to the
Purported Transferor, and shall reimburse the Purported Transferee from the
sale proceeds received from the Purported Transferor (or the proceeds from the
disposition of any non-cash consideration) for the cost (to the Purported
Transferee) of any Excess Securities returned in accordance with Section D(3)
of this Article ELEVENTH. If the Purported Transferee is not determinable, or
to the extent the Excess Securities have been resold and thus cannot be
returned to the Purported Transferor, the Agent shall use the proceeds to
acquire on behalf of the Purported Transferor, in one or more arms-length
transactions (including over a national securities exchange on which the
Corporation Securities may be traded, if possible), an equal amount of
Corporation Securities in replacement of the Excess Securities

 



6  sold; provided, however, that, to the extent the amount of proceeds is not
sufficient to fund the purchase price of such Corporation Securities and the
Agents costs and expenses (as described in Section D(3) of this Article
ELEVENTH), the Purported Transferor shall promptly, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, fund such amounts upon demand by the Agent.

 

(3) Except for Prohibited Distributions that are to be returned to the
Purported Transferor in accordance with Section D(2)(b) of this Article
ELEVENTH, the Agent shall apply any proceeds or any other amounts received by
it by and in accordance with Section D of this Article ELEVENTH as follows:

 

(a) _first_ , such amounts shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary
to cover its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its duties
hereunder;

(b) _second_ , any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported
Transferee, up to the amount paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess
Securities (or the fair market value at the time of the Transfer, in the event
the purported Transfer of the Excess Securities was, in whole or in part, a
gift, inheritance or similar Transfer); and

 

(c) _third_ , any remaining amounts, subject to the limitations imposed by the
following proviso, shall be paid to one or more organizations qualifying
under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code (or any comparable successor provision) ("
_Section 501(c)(3)_ ") selected by the Board; provided, however, that if the
Excess Securities (including any Excess Securities arising from a previous
Prohibited Transfer not sold by the Agent in a prior sale or sales) represent
a [4.9]% or greater Percentage Stock Ownership interest in the Corporation,
then such remaining amounts shall be paid to two or more
organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) selected by the Board, such
that no organization qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) shall possess
Percentage Stock Ownership in the Corporation of [4.8]% or more.

 

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the recourse of any Purported
Transferee in respect of any Prohibited Transfer shall be limited to the
amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to clause (b) above.
Except to the extent used to cover costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in
performing its duties hereunder, in no event shall the proceeds of any sale of
Excess Securities pursuant to this Part D inure to the benefit of the
Corporation.

(4) If the Purported Transferee or the Purported Transferor fails to
surrender the Excess Securities (as applicable) or the proceeds of a sale
thereof to the Agent within thirty (30) days from the date on which the
Corporation makes a demand pursuant to Section D(2) of this Article ELEVENTH,
then the Corporation shall use its best efforts to enforce the provisions
hereof, which may include the institution of legal proceedings to compel the
surrender. Nothing in this Section D(4) of this Article ELEVENTH shall (a)
be deemed inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess Securities provided in
this Article ELEVENTH being void _ab initio_ or (b) preclude the Corporation
in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings without a prior
demand. 

(5) In the event of any Prohibited Transfer that does not involve a transfer
of Corporation Securities within the meaning of the Delaware General
Corporation Law and that is not a Prohibited Transfer pursuant to Section
C(1)(b) of this Article ELEVENTH, the application of Section D(2)-(4) of this
Article ELEVENTH shall be modified as described in this Section D(5) of this
Article ELEVENTH. In such case, no such Purported Transferee shall, to the
fullest extent of the law, be required to dispose of any interest that is not
a Corporation Security, but such Purported Transferee and/or any Person whose
ownership of Corporation Securities is attributed to such Purported
Transferee (such Purported Transferee or other Person, a " _Remedial Holder_
") shall be deemed to have disposed of and, to the fullest extent of the law,
shall be required to dispose of sufficient Corporation Securities (which
Corporation Securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they
were acquired) to cause such Purported Transferee, following such disposition,
not to be in violation of this Article ELEVENTH. Such disposition shall be
deemed to occur simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the
application of this provision, and such number of Corporation Securities that
are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall
be disposed of through the Agent as provided in Section D(2)-(4) of this
Article ELEVENTH, except that the maximum aggregate amount payable to a
Remedial Holder in connection with such sale shall be the fair 

 



7  market value of such Excess Securities at the time of the Prohibited
Transfer. A Remedial Holder, to the fullest extent of the law, shall not be
entitled, with respect to such Excess Securities, to any rights of
stockholders of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to
vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether
liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any, following the time
of the Prohibited Transfer. All expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing
of such Excess Securities shall, to the fullest extent of the law, be paid out
of any amounts due to such Remedial Holder. The purpose of this Section D(5)
of this Article ELEVENTH is to extend the restrictions in Section D(2)-(4) of
this Article ELEVENTH to situations in which there is a Prohibited Transfer
without a direct Transfer of Corporation Securities, and this Section D(5) of
this Article ELEVENTH, along with the other provisions of this Article
ELEVENTH, shall be interpreted to produce the same results, with differences
as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of Corporation Securities.

 

E. _Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any stockholder
subject to the provisions of this Article ELEVENTH who knowingly violates the
provisions of this Article ELEVENTH and any Persons controlling, controlled by
or under common control with such stockholder shall be jointly and severally
liable to the Corporation for, and shall indemnify and hold the Corporation
harmless against, any and all damages suffered as a result of such violation,
including but not limited to damages resulting from a reduction in, or
elimination of, the Corporations ability to utilize its Tax Benefits,
and attorneys and auditors fees incurred in connection with such violation.

F. _Bylaws; Legends; Compliance_  

(1) The bylaws may make appropriate provisions to effectuate the requirements
of this Article ELEVENTH.

 

(2) All certificates (including global certificates) issued by the Corporation
representing Corporation Securities shall bear a conspicuous legend
substantially in the form as follows:

"THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT
OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ELEVENTH OF THE
AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF [ENGILITY HOLDINGS,INC].,

AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

 

 _ARTICLE I  STOCKHOLDERS _

 

 _Section 1._ _Annual Meeting._

 

(1) An annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of directors to
succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such
other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such
place, if any, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall
fix; provided, however, that only the Board of Directors, in its sole
discretion, may determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place but
instead shall be held solely by means of remote communication.

(2) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the
proposal of business to be transacted by the stockholders may be made at an
annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the Corporations proxy
materials with respect to such meeting, (b) subject to Section 3.4 of the
Stockholders Agreement, dated as of [], by and between the Corporation and
Birch Partners, LP (as it may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "Stockholders Agreement") (for so long as the
Stockholders Agreement is in effect), by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, or (c) by any stockholder of record of the Corporation (the "
_Record Stockholder_ ") at the time of the giving of the notice required in
the following paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has
complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (c) shall be the exclusive means
for a stockholder to make nominations or propose business at an annual meeting
of stockholders.

 

(3) For nominations or business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a Record Stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of the foregoing
paragraph, (a) the Record Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in
writing to the Secretary of the Corporation, (b) any such business must be a
proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law and (c) the Record
Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf any such
proposal or nomination is made, must have acted in accordance with the
representations set forth in the Solicitation Statement required by these
Bylaws. To be timely, a Record Stockholders notice shall be received by the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than
90 nor more than 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the preceding
years annual meeting of stockholders (which date shall, in respect of the
Corporations first annual meeting of stockholders after its shares of Common
Stock are first publicly traded, be deemed to have occurred on []);
provided, however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 1(3), if
the meeting is convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 70
days after the anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, or if no
annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the Record
Stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than 120 days prior
to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later
of (i) the 90th day before such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following
the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first
made. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, and
to the extent permissible under the Stockholders Agreement, in the event that
the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased
and there has been no public announcement naming all of the nominees for
director or indicating the increase in the size of the Board of Directors made
by the Corporation at least 10 days before the last day a Record Stockholder
may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance with the preceding sentence,
a Record Stockholders notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered
timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by
such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement
is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall an adjournment, or
postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given, commence a
new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Record
Stockholders notice. (4) Such Record Stockholders notice shall set forth:

 

a. if such notice pertains to the nomination of directors, as to each person
whom the Record Stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection
as a director, all information relating to such person as would be required to
be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as
directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (such act, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ "), and such persons written consent to
being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if
elected;

b. as to any business that the Record Stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, a brief description of such business, the text of the proposal
(including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the
event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the
Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for
conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such
business of such Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the proposal is made; and

 

c. as to (1) the Record Stockholder giving the notice and (2) the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a "
_party_ "):

(i) the name and address of each such party;

 

(ii) (A) the class, series, and number of shares of the Corporation that are
owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record by each such party,
(B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or
other right, in each case with an exercise or conversion privilege or a
settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of
shares of the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the
value of any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such
instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a " _Derivative
Instrument_ ") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by each such party
any of their affiliates or associates and/or any others acting in concert
with any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Proponent Persons_ "), and any
other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived
from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation, (C)
any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to
which any Proponent Person is a party and has a right to vote, directly or
indirectly, any shares of any security of the Corporation, (D) any short
interest in any security of the Corporation held by any Proponent Person (for
purposes of this Section 1(4), a person shall be deemed to have a short
interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any
contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the
opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the
value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of
the Corporation owned beneficially directly or indirectly by any Proponent
Person that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the
Corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or
Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited
partnership in which any Proponent Person is a general partner or, directly or
indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any
performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that any Proponent
Person may directly or indirectly be entitled to based on any increase or
decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments,
if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such
interests held by members of each such Proponent Persons immediate family
sharing the same household;

(iii) any other information relating to each such party that would be
required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be
made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the
proposal and/or the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to
Section 14 of the Exchange Act;

(iv) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of the stock
of the Corporation at the time of the giving of the notice, will be entitled
to vote at such meeting and will appear in person or by proxy at the meeting
to propose such business or nomination and a representation whether or not
each

 



2  such party will (x) deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders
of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all
of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation required under applicable
law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, at
least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of
the Corporation reasonably believed by the Record Stockholder or beneficial
holder, as the case may be, to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees
proposed to be nominated by the Record Stockholder and/or (y) otherwise
solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination
(such representations, a " _Solicitation Statement_ ");

(v) such other information as the Corporation may reasonably require to
determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of
the Corporation and to determine the independence of such director under the
Exchange Act and regulations thereunder and applicable stock exchange rules;
and

(vi) the information required to be set forth in a Record Stockholders notice
(whether given pursuant to this Section 1(4) or Section 2(2) of the Bylaws)
shall be supplemented and updated by such stockholder or beneficial owner, as
the case may be to the extent necessary so that the information provided or
required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct (x) as of
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting and (y) as of the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof, provided that if the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting is less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the information shall be supplemented and updated as of such later
date. Any such update and supplement shall be delivered in writing to the
Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not later than five (5) days after the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting (in the case of
any update and supplement required to be made as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting), not later
than the ten (10) days prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof (in the case of any update or supplement required to
be made as of fifteen (15) days prior the meeting or adjournment or
postponement thereof) and not later than five (5) days after the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, but no later
than the date prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof
(in the case of any update and supplement required to be made as of a date
less than fifteen (15) days prior the date of the meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof).

 

(5) For purposes of these Bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure
in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press
or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the
Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section
13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

 _Section 2._ _Special Meetings._

 

(1) Special meetings of the stockholders, other than those required by
statute, may be called at any time by the Board of Directors acting pursuant
to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of
these Bylaws, the term " _Whole Board_ " shall mean the total number of
authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in
previously authorized directorships. The Board of Directors may postpone or
reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting.

(2) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors. The notice of such special meeting shall
include the purpose for which the meeting is called. Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of
stockholders at which directors are to be elected (a) by or at the direction
of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of record at the time of
giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote
at the meeting and who delivers a written notice to the Secretary setting
forth the information set forth in Section 1(4)a. and 1(4)c. of this Article
I. Nominations by stockholders

 



3  of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at such a
special meeting of stockholders only if such stockholder of records notice
required by the preceding sentence shall be received by the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than 120th day
prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on
the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day
following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of
the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to
be elected at such meeting. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement
of a special meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time
period for the giving of a stockholder of records notice.

 

 _Section 3._ _Business at Meetings_

 

(1) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director
at an annual or special meeting unless (i) the person is nominated by a
Record Stockholder in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 1
and 2 above or (ii) the person is nominated by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors. Only such business shall be conducted at a meeting
of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Sections 1 and 2 above. Except as otherwise
provided herein or required by law (meaning, here and hereinafter, as required
from time to time by the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Corporation (including a certificate of designation
with respect to a series of preferred stock)), the chairman of the meeting
shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance
with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination
or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such
defectively proposed business or nomination shall not be presented for
stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of Sections 1 and 2 above, unless otherwise required
by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder)
does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be
disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted,
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by
the Corporation. For purposes of Sections 1 and 2 above, to be considered a
qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly
authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be
authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as
proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such
writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing
or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

 

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Sections 1 and 2 above, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters
set forth in Sections 1 and 2 above; provided, however, that, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and
shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to
any other business to be considered pursuant to these Bylaws (including
paragraph (2)(c) of Section 1 and paragraph (2) of Section 2), and compliance
with paragraph (2)(c) of Section 1 and paragraph (2) of Section 2 of the
Bylaws shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or
submit other business. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any
rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors
pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of the Incorporation
of the Corporation.

 

 _Section 4._ _Notice of Meetings._

 

Notice of the place, if any, date, and time of all meetings of the
stockholders, the means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in
the case of a special meeting, the purpose for which the meeting is called,
shall be given, not less than 10 nor more than 60

 



4  days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, except as otherwise provided
herein or required by law.

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not
be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, and
the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned
meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken;
provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than 30
days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, notice of
the place, if any, date, and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, shall be
given to each stockholder in conformity with this Section 4\. If after the
adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for
notice of such adjourned meeting, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors and, except as otherwise required by law, shall not be more than
60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such adjourned meeting, and
shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for
notice of such adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any business may
be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

_Section 5._ _Quorum._

 

At any meeting of the stockholders, the holders of a majority of the voting
power of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting,
present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes,
unless or except to the extent that the presence of a larger number may be
required by law or by the rules of any stock exchange upon which the
Corporations securities are listed. Where a separate vote by a class or
classes or series is required, a majority of the voting power of the shares of
such class or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy
shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote
on that matter. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of
the meeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date, or time.

 

 _Section 6._ _Organization._

 

Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence
of such a person, the Chairman of the Board (or either co-chairman, as
provided for in Article II, Section 1) or, in his or her absence, the
President of the Corporation or, in his or her absence, such person as may be
chosen by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares
entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order
any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the
absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting
shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.

_Section 7._ _Conduct of Business._

 

The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of
business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the
manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him or her in order.
The chairman shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to another place, if
any, date and time. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls
for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be
announced at the meeting.

 

 _Section 8._ _Proxies and Voting._

 

At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder entitled to vote may
vote in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a
transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure
established for the meeting. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reliable reproduction of

 



5  the writing or transmission created pursuant to this paragraph may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any
and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be
used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing
or transmission.

 

The Corporation may, and to the extent required by law, shall, in advance of
any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one
or more alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
person presiding at the meeting may, and to the extent required by law,
shall, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector,
before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign
an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict
impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. Every vote taken
by ballots shall be counted by a duly appointed inspector or inspectors.

 

All director elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast,
and except as otherwise required by law or the rules of any stock exchange
upon which the Corporations securities are listed, all other matters shall be
determined by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or
by represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

_Section 9._ _Stock List._

 

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall, at
least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, prepare and make a
complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders;
provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall
reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the
meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each
such stockholder and the number of shares registered in his or her name. Such
list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for a period of at
least 10 days prior to the meeting:

(a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of the meeting; or

(b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps
to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation.

If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of
the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any
stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of
remote communication, then such list shall also be open to the examination of
any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

 

This list shall be the sole evidence of (a) the identity of the stockholders
entitled to examine such stock list and to vote at the meeting and (b) the
number of shares held by each of them.

_Section 10._ _Remote Communication._

If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to
such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt,
stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders may, by means of remote communication:

 

(a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

 



6 (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether
such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication, _provided,_ that

(1) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each
person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote
communication is a stockholder or proxyholder;

 

(2) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially
concurrently with such proceedings; and

 

(3) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the
meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other
action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

_ARTICLE II  BOARD OF DIRECTORS _

 

 _Section 1._ _Number, Election and Term of Directors._

 

Subject to Section 3.4 of the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the
Stockholders Agreement is in effect), and subject to the rights of the
holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under
specified circumstances, the number of directors shall be fixed from time to
time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by
a majority of the Whole Board. Until the earlier of (a) the termination of
the Stockholders Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1 thereof or (b) [],
the Board of Directors shall establish and maintain a co-chairman structure,

under specified circumstances, shall be divided into three classes with the
term of office of the first class to expire at the Corporations first annual
meeting of stockholders, the term of office of the second class to expire at
the Corporations second annual meeting of stockholders and the term of office
of the third class to expire at the Corporations third annual meeting of
stockholders, with each director to hold office until his or her successor
shall have been duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of
stockholders, (i) directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms
expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third
succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election, with each
director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified, and (ii) if authorized by a resolution of the Board of
Directors, directors may be elected to fill any vacancy on the Board of
Directors, regardless of how such vacancy shall have been created, with each
director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified.

 

 _Section 2._ _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies._

 

Subject to Section 3.4 of the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the
Stockholders Agreement is in effect) and the rights of the holders of any
series of preferred stock then outstanding, newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any
vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall, unless otherwise
required by law or by resolution of the Board of Directors, be filled only by
a majority vote of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or
by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and directors so
chosen shall serve for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders
at which the term of office of the class to which they have been chosen
expires or until such directors successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of directors shall shorten the
term of any incumbent director.

 

 _Section 3._ _Regular Meetings._

 

Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place or
places, if any, on such date or dates, and at such time or times as shall
have been established by the Board of Directors and publicized among all
directors. A notice of each regular meeting shall not be required.

 



7 _Section 4._ _Special Meetings._

 

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of
the Board (or either co-chairman, as provided for in Article, II, Section 1),
the Chief Executive Officer, the President or by the Board of Directors and
shall be held at such place, if any, on such date, and at such time as they or
he or she shall fix. Notice of the place, if any, date, and time of each
such special meeting shall be given to each director by whom it is not waived
by mailing written notice not less than five days before the meeting or by
telephone or by telegraphing or telexing or by facsimile or electronic
transmission of the same not less than 24 hours before the meeting. Unless
otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be
transacted at a special meeting.

 

 _Section 5._ _Quorum._

 

A majority of the Whole Board shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at
any meeting of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall fail to attend any
meeting, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting to another place,
if any, date, or time, without further notice or waiver thereof.

 

 _Section 6._ _Participation in Meetings By Conference Telephone._

 

Members of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may
participate in a meeting of such Board of Directors or committee by means of

order and manner as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine,
and, except as otherwise expressly required by law, all matters shall be

all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. Any director of
the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice (including by
electronic transmission) to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board
of Directors (or either co-chairman, as provided for in Article II, Section
1), the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary. Such
resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time is

Directors and shall, subject to Section 3.4 of the Stockholders Agreement (for
so long as the Stockholders Agreement is in effect), for those committees,
elect a director or directors to serve as the member or members, designating,
if it desires, other directors as alternate members who may replace any absent
or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of any member of any committee and any alternate member in
his or her place, subject to Section 3.4 of the Stockholders Agreement (for so
long as the Stockholders Agreement is in effect), the member or members of the
committee present at the meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not he or she or they constitute a quorum, may by unanimous vote appoint
another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of
the absent or disqualified member if and to the extent the resolution of the
Board of Directors establishing such committee so provides.

its business and shall act in accordance therewith, except as otherwise
provided herein or required by law. Adequate provision shall be made for
notice to members of all meetings; a majority of the members shall constitute
a quorum unless the committee shall consist of one or two members, in which
event one member shall constitute a quorum; and all matters shall be
determined by a majority vote of the members present. Action may be taken by
any committee without a meeting if all members thereof consent thereto in
writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or
electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of the
proceedings of such committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the

number of offices may be held by the same person. The salaries of officers
elected by the Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by the

may possess by reason of its ownership of securities in such other
corporation.

 



9 _ARTICLE V  STOCK _

 

 _Section 1._ _Certificates of Stock._

 

The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided
that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that
some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be
uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
Corporation. Each holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
entitled to a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the
Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board (or either co-chairman, as provided for
in Article II, Section 1), or the President or a Vice President, and by the
Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him or
her. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be by facsimile.

_Section 2._ _Transfers of Stock._

 

Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the
Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation or by transfer
agents designated to transfer shares of the stock of the Corporation. Except
where a certificate is issued in accordance with Section 4 of Article V of
these Bylaws, an outstanding certificate for the number of shares involved, if
one has been issued, shall be surrendered for cancellation before a new
certificate, if any, is issued therefor.

 

 _Section 3._ _Record Date._

 

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
of Directors may, except as otherwise required by law, fix a record date,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date
shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors
may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date
for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 3 at the adjourned
meeting.

 

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such
action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 

 _Section 4._ _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._

 

In the event of the loss, theft or destruction of any certificate of stock,
another may be issued in its place pursuant to such regulations as the Board
of Directors may establish concerning proof of such loss, theft or destruction
and concerning the giving of a satisfactory bond or bonds of indemnity.

 



10 _Section 5._ _Regulations._

 

The issue, transfer, conversion and registration of certificates of stock
shall be governed by such other regulations as the Board of Directors may
establish.

manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any
notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner
provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

 _Section 2._ _Waivers._

 

A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder or director, or waiver
by electronic transmission by such person, whether given before or after the
time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent
to the notice required to be given to such person. Neither the business nor
the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver. Attendance at
any meeting shall constitute waiver of notice except attendance for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.

 

 _ARTICLE VII  MISCELLANEOUS _

 

 _Section 1._ _Facsimile Signatures._

opinions, reports or statements presented to the Corporation by any of its
officers or employees, or committees of the Board of Directors so designated,

 _ARTICLE VIII  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS _

 

 _Section 1._ _Right to Indemnification._

 

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the
Corporation or any predecessor or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation or any predecessor, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation or any predecessor as a director, officer, employee, agent or
trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, agent
or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
employee, agent or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and
loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as
provided in Section 3 of this Article VIII with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses or with respect
to any compulsory counterclaim brought by such indemnitee, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 

 _Section 2._ _Right to Advancement of Expenses._

 

In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this
Article VIII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in appearing at,
participating in or defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition or in connection with a proceeding brought to establish
or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Article VIII (which shall be governed by Section 3 of this Article VIII)
(hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); provided, however, that, if
the Delaware General Corporation Law requires or in the case of an advance
made in a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or advancement, an advancement of expenses incurred by an
indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made solely upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter
an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial
decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "
_final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
or entitled to advancement of expenses under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article
VIII or otherwise.

 



12 _Section 3._ _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit._

 

If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by
the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim for indemnification has
been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an
advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days,
the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or to obtain advancement of
expenses, as applicable. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful
in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation
to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by
the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances
because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII
or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

_Section 4._ _Non-Exclusivity of Rights._

 

The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in
this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporations Certificate
of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors or
otherwise.

 

 _Section 5._ _Insurance._

 

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and
any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the Delaware General Corporation Law.

_Section 6._ _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of
the Corporation._

The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation or any predecessor to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Corporation or any predecessor.

_Section 7._ _Nature of Rights._

 

The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VIII shall be contract
rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to
be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of this Article VIII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee
or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit,

 



13  eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving
any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

The obligations of the Corporation under this Article to indemnify or advance
expenses to any indemnitee for the matters covered hereby shall be the
primary source of indemnification and advancement of such indemnitee in
connection therewith, and any obligation on the part of any stockholder of the
Corporation, its affiliates and controlling persons (the "other indemnitor")
under any organizational document, agreement or insurance policies maintained
by such other indemnitor providing for, among other things, indemnification of
and advancement of expenses for the indemnitee for, among other things, the
same matters that are subject to indemnification and advancement of expenses
under this Article (the "other indemnification agreements") shall be secondary
to the Corporations obligation to indemnify and advance expenses to
such indemnitee and shall be reduced by any amount that such indemnitee may
collect as indemnification or advancement from the Corporation. In the event
that the Corporation fails to indemnify or advance expenses to an indemnitee
as required or contemplated by this Article (any such amount that the
Corporation fails to indemnify or advance to an indemnitee as required or
contemplated by this Article, an "unpaid indemnity amount"), and any other
indemnitor makes any payment to such indemnitee in respect of indemnification
or advancement of expenses under any such other indemnification agreement on
account of such unpaid indemnity amounts, such other indemnitor shall be
subrogated to the rights of such indemnitee under this Article, in respect to
such unpaid indemnity amounts.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) the Corporations
obligation to indemnify any indemnitee under this Article shall include any
amounts expended by any other indemnitor under any other indemnification
agreement in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses to
any indemnitee in connection with litigation or other proceedings involving
his or her services as a director or officer of the Corporation to the extent
such amount expended by such other indemnitor are on account of any unpaid
indemnity amount and (ii) the Corporation shall not be entitled to
contribution or indemnification from, or subrogation against, any such other
indemnitor in respect of amounts expended by the Corporation to indemnify or
advance expenses to an indemnitee under this Article.

_ARTICLE IX  AMENDMENTS; INTERPRETATION _

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, subject
to Section 10.13 of the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the
Stockholders Agreement is in effect), the Board of Directors is expressly
authorized to adopt, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, these Bylaws
subject to the power of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, with respect to
the power of holders of capital stock to adopt, amend and repeal Bylaws of the
Corporation, notwithstanding any other provision of these Bylaws or any
provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but
in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the capital
stock of the Corporation required herein or by law, the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75)% of the voting power of all
of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt,
amend or repeal, in whole or in part, any provision of these Bylaws or
to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.

ARTICLE IV

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

Section 4.1 _Transfer Restrictions_. Except as expressly provided in this
Article IV, or in accordance with a written consent granted by a committee of
the Board consisting solely of Independent Directors (the " _Committee_ ")
pursuant to the Charter, for the period beginning on the date hereof and
ending on the earlier of the day following the six (6) year anniversary of
the date hereof and the date on which the Company undergoes an Ownership
Change, (i) no member of the Stockholder Group shall sell or transfer any of
the shares of Common Stock directly held by any member of the Stockholder
Group, (ii) no KKR Investor or GA Investor (x) shall permit (by providing
consent thereto or otherwise) any direct or indirect sale or transfer of an
equity interest in a KKR Investor or a GA Investor by any Person who
holds any direct or indirect equity interest in any of the KKR Investors or
GA Investors, respectively (each, a " _Partner_ ") (other than pursuant to a
redemption of such an equity interest in a KKR Investor or a GA Investor) that
would result in an "owner shift" under Section 382(g) of the Code with
respect to the Company (an " _Owner Shift_ ") or (y) shall permit (by
providing consent thereto or

 



13  otherwise) any transfer of the limited partnership interests of the
Stockholder directly held by any Co-Investor Partner and (iii) no member of
the Stockholder Group nor any KKR Investor or GA Investor shall otherwise
effect any transaction that would result in a direct or indirect transfer of
shares of Common Stock (including pursuant to a redemption of an equity
interest in a KKR Investor or GA Investor) unless (solely in the case of this
clause (iii)) the Stockholder Group, KKR Investor or GA Investor, as
applicable, receives a written determination of the Committee that such
transaction would not result in an Owner Shift; _provided,_ that, as a
condition to making such determination, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, require and/or obtain (at the expense of the Stockholder Group,
the KKR Investors or the GA Investors, as applicable) such representations
from the Stockholder Group, KKR Investors, GA Investors and/or transferee(s),
such opinions of counsel or tax advisors to be rendered by counsel or tax
advisors selected by (or acceptable to) the Committee (provided that Deloitte
Tax LLP, Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and
Garrison LLP shall be considered acceptable to the Committee) (any such
counsel or advisor, an " _Acceptable Advisor_ "), and such other advice, in
each case as reasonably necessary to determine whether the transaction
results in an Owner Shift. For the avoidance of doubt, a transfer subject to
this Article IV includes, without limitation, a hedging or other transaction
that transfers ownership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Until the day
after the three (3) year anniversary of the date hereof, the Stockholder
shall not effect a Distribution.

Section 4.2 _Waiver of Transfer Restrictions_.

(a) Notwithstanding the restriction in Section 4.1, for the period beginning
on the day following the three (3) year anniversary of the date hereof and
ending on the earlier of the day following the six (6) year anniversary of the
date hereof and the date on which the Company undergoes an Ownership Change,
the Stockholder Group may directly or indirectly sell or transfer, and the
KKR Investors and GA Investors and any Partner or Co-Investor Partner may
effect an indirect (or, if applicable, direct) sale or transfer, of up to an
aggregate of [ _insert number of shares equal to 45% of the total number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after the Mergers_ ] shares of
Common Stock, as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split or similar
transaction (the " _Waived Transfer Amount_ ");  _provided, however_ , that
(x) any direct or indirect sale or transfer of an equity interest in a KKR
Investor or a GA Investor by a Partner (other than pursuant to a redemption of
such a Partners equity interest in such KKR Investor or GA Investor) that
does not result in an Owner Shift shall not count toward or reduce the Waived
Transfer Amount and (y) any other direct or indirect sale or transfer by any
member of the Stockholder Group, the KKR Investors or the GA Investors or a
redemption of a Partners equity interest in a KKR Investor or a GA Investor
that, in accordance with a written determination of the Committee, does not
result in an Owner Shift shall not count toward or reduce the Waived Transfer
Amount; _provided, further,_ that, as a condition to making such determination
pursuant to this Section 4.2(a)(y), the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
require and/or obtain (at the expense of the Stockholder Group, the
KKR Investors, the GA Investors or Partner, as applicable) such
representations from the Stockholder Group, KKR Investors, GA Investors,
Partner and/or transferee(s), such opinions of counsel or tax advisors to be
rendered by an Acceptable Advisor, and such other advice, in each case as
reasonably necessary to determine whether the transaction results in an Owner
Shift; _provided, further_ , that prior to any sale or transfer pursuant to
this Section 4.2(a) that is included in the Waived Transfer Amount the
Stockholder or member of the Stockholder Group, as applicable, shall provide
to the Company a written notice stating (i) the amount of the applicable sale
or transfer, (ii) the name of the Person making such sale or transfer and
(iii) the portion of the Waived Transfer Amount allocated to such sale or
transfer, and such written notice shall be countersigned and acknowledged by
each of the KKR Investors and the GA Investors. In the case of any
Distribution by the Stockholder Group to a Co-Investor Partner, such
Distribution will count toward and reduce the Waived Transfer Amount, unless
in addition to the written determination of the Committee that such transfer
by the Stockholder Group does not result in an Owner Shift as described in
Section 4.2(a)(y) above, either (A) the Committee makes a written
determination that a sale or transfer of Common Stock directly held by such
Co-Investor Partner after the Distribution does not result in an Owner Shift
or (B) such Co-Investor Partner represents and undertakes to the Company that
it will not directly sell or transfer any Common Stock received in such
Distribution, other than in a distribution to the equity holders of such Co-
Investor Partner; _provided, further_ , that, as a condition to making any
determination described in this sentence, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, require and/or obtain (at the expense of the Stockholder 

 



14  Group) such representations from the Stockholder Group, Co-Investor Partner
and/or transferee(s), such opinions of counsel or tax advisors to be rendered
by an Acceptable Advisor, and such other advice, in each case as reasonably
necessary to determine whether the Distribution (and subsequent sale or
transfer described in clause (A), as applicable) results in an Owner Shift.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the case of
any written determination by the Committee described in this Section 4.2(a),
if the Stockholder Group, KKR Investor, GA Investor or Partner receives an
opinion of counsel or tax advisors rendered by an Acceptable Advisor that such
sale, transfer or Distribution, as applicable, will not result in an Owner
Shift, the Committee shall provide such written determination and such sale,
transfer or Distribution, as applicable, shall not count toward or reduce the
Waived Transfer Amount, in each case unless the Committee, in its reasonable
discretion, does not find such opinion acceptable. In the cases in which the
Committee is requested or required, as applicable, to deliver a written
determination pursuant to Section 4.1 or this Section 4.2(a), the Company
will cause the Committee to, reasonably promptly after all representations,
opinions and other advice requested by the Committee have been received,
deliver such written determination or notify such Person that no such written
determination will be delivered. Except if the Committee has delivered a
written determination, if any transaction would reduce the Waived Transfer
Amount pursuant to this Section 4.2(a), the relevant member of the
Stockholder Group or the relevant KKR Investor or GA Investor, as applicable,
may in its sole election either (1) effect such transaction after receipt of
the Committees favorable written determination, in which case such
transaction will not count toward or reduce the Waived Transfer Amount or (2)
effect such transaction prior to receipt of the Committees written
determination, in which case such transaction will count toward and reduce the
Waived Transfer Amount, and if the Committee subsequently delivers a
favorable written determination, the Waived Transfer Amount will be adjusted
and increased to the extent that such transaction would not have counted
toward or reduced the Waived Transfer Amount had the favorable written
determination been received prior to the transaction.

(b) Notwithstanding the restriction in Sections 4.1 and 4.2(a), beginning on
the earlier of (i) the day following the six (6) year anniversary of the date
hereof and (ii) the day following the date on which the Company undergoes an
Ownership Change, the Stockholder Group, the KKR Investors, the GA Investors,
the Partners and the Co-Investor Partners may, subject to Section 4.3,
directly or indirectly sell or transfer any of the shares of Common Stock held
directly or indirectly by them, regardless of whether such sale or transfer
results in an Owner Shift, and Sections 4.1 and 4.2(a) of this Agreement
shall be of no further effect.

Section 4.3 _Additional Transfer Restrictions_. In addition to the
restrictions set forth in Section 4.2(a), so long as this Agreement has not
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, no member of the Stockholder Group shall,
individually or in the aggregate, other than in connection with a registered
public offering, including any Underwritten Offering or a Change of Control
transaction, which Change of Control transaction is approved by the Board,
knowingly Transfer shares of Common Stock to a Person, other than to any
Permitted Transferee, who, after such acquisition, would hold in excess of 5%
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.

ARTICLE V 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 

Section 5.1 _Shelf Registration; Underwritten Offering_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.11 and the limitations set forth in
Section 4.2(a) on the number of shares of Common Stock that may be sold
during the period referred to therein, at any time after the third anniversary
of the date hereof until the sixth anniversary of the date hereof, at the
request of any Stockholder (which, for purposes of this Article V, shall be
deemed to include each holder of Registrable Shares) and on the business day
following the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Company will file a
Shelf Registration Statement (which Shelf Registration Statement shall be an
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) if the Company is then eligible to file an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement) registering for resale all of the Registrable Shares
under the Securities Act. Until such time as all

 



15  Registrable Shares cease to be Registrable Shares or the Company is no
longer eligible to maintain a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company will
keep current and effective such Shelf Registration Statement and file such
supplements or amendments to such Shelf Registration Statement (or file a new
Shelf Registration Statement (which Shelf Registration Statement shall be an
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement if the Company is then eligible to
file an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement) when such preceding Shelf
Registration Statement expires pursuant to the rules of the SEC) as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to keep such Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective and useable for the resale of all
Registrable Shares under the Securities Act. The Company represents and
warrants to each Stockholder that as of the date of this Agreement, the
Company is not an "ineligible issuer" and is a "well known seasoned issuer",
in each case as defined under the Securities Act.

(b) Upon the written request of any Stockholder from time to time (an "
_Underwritten Offering Request_ "), the Company will cooperate with the
requesting Stockholder and any Underwriter in effecting an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement as promptly as reasonably
practicable following receipt of such Underwritten Offering Request;
_provided, however,_ that (i) the Stockholders together shall not be entitled
to make more than two (2) Underwritten Offering Requests, where the plan of
distribution set forth in the Underwritten Offering Request includes a
customary "road show" or other substantial marketing effort by the Company and
the underwriter (a " _Marketed Underwritten Offering_ ") in any twelve (12)
month period, it being understood that the Stockholders may make an unlimited
number of requests for Underwritten Offerings that are not Marketed
Underwritten Offerings; and (ii) the requesting Stockholder will be deemed
to have requested the removal of any Registrable Shares held by such
Stockholder from any Underwritten Offering Request relating to a Marketed
Underwritten Offering and to have rescinded such Underwritten Offering
Request, with the same effects as provided in Section 5.6, automatically if:
(A) the Launch Date in respect of such Marketed Underwritten Offering has not
occurred by the end of the fifth (5th) Business Day after the following
conditions have been met: (1) the Company has made available to the
requesting Stockholder a prospectus under an effective Registration Statement
naming the Stockholder as a selling stockholder and the underwriter(s) and
containing such other information as is required under the Securities Act and
the rules of the SEC in a form ready for filing, assuming that as of such time
(X) the Company has otherwise complied with its applicable obligations in
Section 5.10 and (Y) such Stockholder has otherwise complied with its
obligations in Section 5.12, and (2) the Company has notified such Stockholder
in writing that the Company has complied with the provisions of this clause
(A) and that the five (5) Business Day period referenced in this clause (A)
is commencing, or (B) such Marketed Underwritten Offering has not been priced
by the end of the third (3rd) Business Day after the Launch Date, assuming
that the Launch Date occurred before the expiration of the five (5) Business
Day period referenced in clause (A) above). Each Underwritten Offering Request
will specify the number of Registrable Shares proposed by the Stockholder to
be included in such Underwritten Offering, the intended method
of distribution and the estimated gross proceeds of such Underwritten
Offering, which (i) in the case of a Marketed Underwritten Offering, may not
be less than $50 million or (ii) in the case of any other Underwritten Offer,
may not be less than $25 million or, in either case, if less, all of the
Registrable Shares held by the requesting Stockholder. Subject to Section 5.8,
the requesting Stockholder may change the number of Registrable Shares
proposed to be offered in any Marketed Underwritten Offering at any time
prior to the Launch Date of such Underwritten Offering so long as such change
would not reduce the estimated gross proceeds of such Marketed Underwritten
Offering to less than the applicable minimum amount provided in the preceding
sentence.

Section 5.2 _Demand Registration Rights_. If, at any time while there still
remain Registrable Shares, the Company is no longer eligible to use or,
notwithstanding its obligations under Section 5.1(a), otherwise ceases to
maintain an effective Shelf Registration Statement, without limiting the
rights of the Stockholders hereunder, within ten (10) days after a
Stockholders written request to Register the resale of a specified amount of
the Registrable Shares under the Securities Act (a " _Demand Notice_ "), the
Company will file a Registration Statement, on an appropriate form which the
Company is then eligible to use, to Register the resale of such Registrable
Shares, which Registration Statement will (if specified in the Demand Notice)
contemplate the ability of such requesting Stockholder to effect an
Underwritten Offering in accordance with Section 5.1(b) (each such
Registration, a " _Demand Registration_ "); _provided, however,_ that the
Stockholders together shall not be entitled to 

 



16  request more than eight (8) Demand Registrations (with KKR and the KKR
Investors together being entitled to make, or cause to be made, four (4) of
such eight (8) Demand Registrations, and General Atlantic and the GA
Investors together being entitled to make, or cause to be made four (4) of
such eight (8) Demand Registrations). A request that (i) does not result in an
effective Registration Statement under the Securities Act that has remained
effective for a period of at least 180 days or such shorter period in which
all Registrable Shares included in such Demand Registration have actually been
sold thereunder ( _provided_ that such period shall be extended for a period
of time equal to the period the holder of Registrable Shares refrains from
selling any securities included in such registration statement at the request
of the Company or the lead managing underwriter pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement (an " _Extension Period_ ")) or (ii) if, after it has become
effective, such Demand Registration becomes subject, prior to 180 days after
effectiveness (plus any Extension Period), to any stop order, injunction or
other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental authority, other
than by reason of any act or omission by the requesting Stockholder shall not
be counted as a utilized request for purposes of the limits in the
preceding sentence. Each Demand Notice will specify the number of Registrable
Shares proposed to be offered for sale, the intended method of distribution
thereof and the estimated gross proceeds of such Demand Registration, which
may not be less than $50 million, or, if less, all of the Registrable Shares
held by the requesting Stockholder. Subject to Section 5.8, the requesting
Stockholder may change the number of Registrable Shares proposed to be offered
pursuant to any Demand Registration at any time prior to the Registration
Statement with respect to the Demand Registration being declared effective by
the SEC, so long as such change would not reduce the estimated gross proceeds
of the Demand Registration to less than $50 million. The Company shall have
the right to satisfy a Demand Notice by filing a Shelf Registration Statement.

Section 5.3 _Effectiveness_. The Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause any Registration Statement to be declared effective
(unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) as promptly as
practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and (ii) keep such
Registration Statement current and effective for a period necessary for the
completion of the resale of Registrable Shares registered thereon. The Company
further agrees to supplement or make amendments to each such Registration
Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective
for the period referred to in clause (ii) above, including (A) to respond to
the comments of the SEC, if any, (B) as may be required by the registration
form utilized by the Company for such Registration Statement or by the
instructions to such registration form, (C) as may be required by the
Securities Act, (D) as may be required in connection with an Underwritten
Offering, or (E) as may be reasonably requested in writing by the
Stockholders or any underwriter and reasonably acceptable to the Company. The
Company agrees to furnish to each Stockholder one electronic copy of any such
supplement or amendment no later than the time it is first being used or
filed with the SEC.

Section 5.4 _Choice of Underwriter_. In the event that a Demand Registration
involves an Underwritten Offering of Registrable Shares, the underwriters will
be selected by the Stockholder requesting such Demand Registration; _provided_
, that any underwriter must be reasonably acceptable to the Company,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall take such
actions as the underwriters may reasonably request in their efforts to sell
Registrable Shares pursuant to such Registration Statement.

 

Section 5.5 _Stockholder Determinations_. The Stockholders participating in an
Underwritten Offering will be permitted to determine in good faith, matters
affecting the structure of such Underwritten Offering undertaken pursuant to
Section 5.1(b) or Demand Registrations, as applicable, including the price,
underwriting discount and other financial terms for the Registrable Shares.

Section 5.6 _Ability to Rescind Underwritten Offering Requests and Demand
Registrations_. Each Stockholder will be permitted to request the removal of
any Registrable Shares held by it from any Underwritten Offering Request or
Demand Registration at any time prior to the pricing of the Underwritten
Offering or the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement, as
applicable, by providing written notice thereof to the Company; _provided_ _,_
that so long as such Stockholder reimburses the Company for its proportionate
share of the reasonable, out of pocket expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with such Underwritten Offering Request, Demand Notice or Demand
Registration; _provided, further,_ that such Underwritten Offering Request or

 



17  Demand Registration shall not be counted as a utilized Underwritten Offering
Request or Demand Registration, as the case may be, for purposes of the limits
in Section 5.1(b) and Section 5.2, respectively.

Section 5.7 _Piggyback Registration_. Subject to Section 5.11, if, at any time
while there still remain Registrable Shares, the Company proposes to file a
new registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to an
offering of Common Stock for (i) the Companys own account (other than a
registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 (or any substitute form that may be
adopted by the SEC) or Company dividend reinvestment plans) or (ii) the
account of any holder of Common Stock, then the Company shall give written
notice of such proposed filing to the Stockholders as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in no event less than ten (10) Business Days before the
anticipated filing date of such new registration statement). Upon a written
request, given by a Stockholder to the Company within ten (10) days after
delivery of any such notice by the Company, to include Registrable Shares of
such Stockholder in such registration (which request shall specify the number
of Registrable Shares proposed to be included in such new registration
statement if such registration statement is not a "pay as you go" Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement), the Company shall, subject to Section 5.8,
include all such requested Registrable Shares in such new registration
statement on the same terms and conditions as applicable to the Companys or
such holders Common Stock (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if at any time after giving written notice of such proposed
filing and prior to the effective date of such new registration statement,
the Company or such holders shall determine for any reason not to proceed with
the proposed filing of the new registration statement, then the Company may,
at its election, give written notice of such determination to the
Stockholders and, thereupon, will be relieved of its obligation to register
any Registrable Shares in connection with such new registration statement.

 

Section 5.8 _Reduction of Size of Underwritten Offering_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if the lead underwriter or
underwriters of a Marketed Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 5.1, a
Demand Registration that involves a Marketed Underwritten Offering or a
Piggyback Registration advise the participating Stockholders and the Company
in writing that, in their reasonable opinion the number of shares of Common
Stock (including any Registrable Shares) that the Company, the participating
Stockholders and any other Persons intend to dispose of pursuant to any such
Underwritten Offering or Piggyback Registration is such that the success of
any such Underwritten Offering or Piggyback Registration would be materially
and adversely affected, including with respect to the price at which the
securities can be sold, then such Underwritten Offering or Piggyback
Registration shall include only such securities as the Company and the
participating Stockholders are advised by such lead underwriter or
underwriters can be sold without such material and adverse effect,
in accordance with the following priorities:

(a) priority in the case of an Underwritten Offering initiated by the Company
for its own account which gives rise to a Piggyback Registration pursuant to
Section 5.7 will be (A) _first_ , all shares of Common Stock proposed to be
offered by the Company for its own account, (B) _second_ , _pro rata_
among (1) the Registrable Shares requested to be disposed of pursuant to the
Underwritten Offering for the account of the participating Stockholders
pursuant to Section 5.7 and (2) any shares of Common Stock requested to be

(a) before filing a Registration Statement, the prospectus, any supplement to
the prospectus and any amendments or supplements to any issuer free writing
prospectus containing information pertaining to any Stockholder, provide such
Stockholder, its counsel and any lead managing underwriter with the
opportunity to reasonably review and comment thereon and to object to any

Company shall make the corrections reasonably and timely requested by such
Stockholder with respect to such information prior to filing any such
Registration Statement, prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto or any
amendment or supplement to any issuer free writing prospectus, it being
understood that the Company shall not file any such Registration Statement or
prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto in connection with its
obligations under Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof with respect to any Demand
Registration to which the Stockholders holding a majority of the Registrable
Shares, their counsel or the lead managing underwriter, if any, shall
reasonably object, in writing, on a timely basis;

(b) as promptly as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement to effect such registration in accordance with the intended method
or methods of distribution of such securities and thereafter to cause such
Registration Statement to become and remain effective pursuant to the terms
of this Article V and prepare and file with the SEC such pre- and post-
effective amendments to such Registration Statement, supplements to the

prospectus as may be (A) reasonably and timely requested by any Stockholder or
(B) necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the period of
time required by this Agreement, and comply with provisions of the applicable
securities laws with respect to the sale or other disposition of all
Registrable Shares covered by such Registration Statement during such period

participating Stockholders, promptly include in a prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment such information as the lead managing underwriter, if
any, and such holders may reasonably request in order to permit the intended
method of distribution of such securities and make all required filings of
such prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Company has received such request;

 

(d) promptly notify the participating Stockholders and the lead underwriter or
underwriters, if any, and, if requested, confirm such notification in writing
and provide copies of the relevant documents, as promptly as

 



19  reasonably practicable: (A) of the filing or effectiveness, as applicable,
of the applicable Registration Statement or any amendment thereto or the
applicable prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, (B) of the receipt of any written comments from the SEC or
any request by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity for amendments or

prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the issuance by the SEC of
any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or
any order by the SEC or any other regulatory authority preventing or
suspending the use of any prospectus or any issuer free writing prospectus or
the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such purposes, (D) if, at
any time, the representations and warranties of the Company in any applicable
underwriting agreement cease to be true and correct in all material respects,
and (E) of the receipt by the Company or its legal counsel of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Shares
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of
any proceeding for such purpose;

(e) promptly notify the participating Stockholders and the lead underwriter
or underwriters, if any: (A) when the Company becomes aware of the occurrence
of any event as a result of which the applicable Registration Statement, the
prospectus included in such Registration Statement (as then in effect) or any
issuer free writing prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein (in the case of such
prospectus or any issuer free writing prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and (B) when any
issuer free writing prospectus includes information that may conflict with
the information contained in the Registration Statement, or, if for any other
reason it shall be necessary during such time period to amend or supplement
such Registration Statement, prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus in
order to comply with the Securities Act and, in either case, as promptly as
practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the SEC, and furnish without
charge to the participating Stockholders and the lead underwriter or
underwriters, if any, any amendment or supplement to such Registration
Statement, prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus which shall correct
such misstatement or omission or effect such compliance;

 

(f) use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent, or obtain the
withdrawal of, any stop order or other order suspending the use of
any prospectus or any issuer free writing prospectus;

(g) deliver to each participating Stockholder and each underwriter, if any,

writing prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto as such

the Company consents to the use of such prospectus, any issuer free writing
prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by such Stockholder and
underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Shares thereby) and such other documents as such Stockholder and
each underwriter, if any, may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Shares by such Stockholder and underwriters, if
any;

 

(h) subject to the terms set forth in Section 5.11, on or prior to the date on
which the applicable Registration Statement is declared effective, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Shares
covered by such Registration Statement under such other securities or "blue
sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as any participating
Stockholder reasonably (in light of its intended plan of distribution)
requests and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to enable such Stockholder to consummate the
disposition of the Registrable Shares Beneficially Owned by such Stockholder
pursuant to such Registration Statement; _provided, however,_ that the Company
shall not be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation to do business
under the laws of any such state in which it is not then qualified or to file
any general consent to service of process in any such state;

(i) make such representations and warranties to the underwriters or agents,
if any, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers in
underwritten public offerings;

 

(j) enter into such agreements (including an underwriting agreement in form,
scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings, including
indemnification provisions and procedures substantially to the

 



20  effect set forth in Article VI hereof) and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take all such other actions reasonably requested by the holders of
a majority of the Registrable Shares being sold in connection therewith
(including those reasonably requested by the lead managing underwriter(s), if
any) to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Shares;

 

(k) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for delivery to the lead
underwriter, if any, an opinion or opinions from counsel for the Company
dated the effective date of the Registration Statement or, in the event of an
Underwritten Offering, the date of the closing under the underwriting
agreement, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in
an underwritten secondary public offering;

(l) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain for delivery to the Company and the lead underwriter, if
any, a "comfort" letter from the Companys independent certified public
accountants in form and substance as is customarily given by independent
certified public accountants in an underwritten secondary public offering
and, to the extent reasonably required, a similar "comfort" letter relating to
any financial statements of any other entity included in such registration
statement;

 

(m) cooperate with each participating Stockholder and the underwriters, if
any, of such Registrable Shares and their respective counsel in connection
with any filings required to be made with FINRA or any registrations or
approvals required by any other governmental agency or authority as may be
reasonably necessary to enable the participating Stockholder thereof to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Shares;

(n) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Shares
covered by the applicable Registration Statement to be listed or quoted on a
national securities exchange or trading system and each securities exchange
and trading system, if any, on which similar securities issued by the Company
are then listed;

 

(o) cooperate with the participating Stockholders and the underwriters, if
any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates, with
requisite CUSIP numbers, representing Registrable Shares to be sold and not
bearing any restrictive legends;

(p) in the case of a Marketed Underwritten Offering, have appropriate
officers of the Company prepare presentations and ensure that two (2) senior
officers of the Company who are reasonably acceptable to the participating
Stockholders (A) reasonably participate in good faith in the customary "road
show" presentations and other customary marketing efforts, including analyst
and rating agency presentations, that may be reasonably requested by the lead
underwriter or underwriters in any such Marketed Underwritten Offering, and
(B) take such actions as the lead underwriter or underwriters or the
participating Stockholders may reasonably request in order to expedite or
facilitate the sale of Registrable Shares;

(q) use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure the cooperation of the
Companys transfer agent in settling any offering or sale of Registrable
Shares, including with respect to the transfer of physical security
instruments into book-entry form in accordance with any procedures reasonably
requested by the participating Stockholders or any lead underwriter
or underwriters; and

(r) (A) make available for inspection by the participating Stockholders, lead
underwriter or underwriters, if any, and any attorneys or accountants
retained by the lead underwriter or underwriters, at the offices where
normally kept, during reasonable business hours, financial and other records
and pertinent corporate documents of the Company as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, (B) cause the officers, directors and employees of the Company
to supply all information in each case reasonably requested by any such
representative, lead underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with
such Registration Statement, and (C) make the Companys independent certified
public accountants (and independent certified public accountants for any other
entity for which financial statements are included in such registration
statement) available for any such lead underwriters or underwriters due
diligence if so requested by counsel to the Underwriters; _provided, however,_
that the Company shall not be required to provide any information pursuant

 



21  to this section if (1) the Company believes in good faith based on the
advice of counsel that to do so would cause the Company to forfeit an
attorney-client privilege that was applicable to such information, (2) the
Company has requested and been granted from the SEC confidential treatment of
such information or (3) any such information is identified by the Company as
being confidential or proprietary, unless, with respect to clause (2) or (3)
of this sentence, each Person receiving such information shall take such
actions as are reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality of such
information and shall sign customary confidentiality agreements reasonably
requested by the Company prior to the receipt of such information; and
_provided, further_ that, the foregoing inspection and information gathering
shall be conducted in such a way as not to materially disrupt the
Companys conduct of its business, and such inspection and information
gathering shall, to the greatest extent possible, be coordinated on behalf of
the parties entitled thereto by one counsel designated by and on behalf of
such parties.

 

Section 5.11 _Right to Defer Registration_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled, from time to time, by providing prior written
notice to the Stockholders, to require the Stockholders to suspend the use of
the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein for
resales of Registrable Shares pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 or
to postpone the filing or suspend the use of any Registration Statement
pursuant to Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or Section 5.7 for a reasonable period of
time not to exceed forty-five (45) consecutive days (a " _Black-Out Period_
") if the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the Company
determines in his or her good faith judgment that it would be materially
detrimental to the Company and/or its securityholders not to defer the filing,
or not to suspend the use by the Stockholders, of a Registration Statement or
prospectus by reason of: (A) the Company being in possession of material non-
public information, so long as the chief executive officer or chief financial
officer of the Company determines in good faith that the disclosure of such
information during the period specified in such notice would be required to be
disclosed and that such disclosure would be materially detrimental to the
Company and/or its securityholders, or (B) a contemplated financing, offering
or sale of any class of securities by the Company, acquisition, disposition,
corporate reorganization, merger, or other similar transaction or other
material event or circumstance affecting the Company or its securities, so
long as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the Company
determines in good faith that the disclosure of such transaction, event or
circumstance at such time would be required to be disclosed and that
such disclosure would be materially detrimental to the Company and/or its
securityholders; _provided,_ that the Company shall not be permitted to (x)
require the Stockholders to suspend the use of such prospectus or (y) postpone
the filing, or suspend the use, of such Registration Statement pursuant to
this Section 5.11, more than twice in any twelve (12) month period. If, for
any reason, the Company files a Registration Statement or commences an
Underwritten Offering (on behalf of a holder of Common Stock) during the
Black-Out Period, (1) the Black-Out Period shall immediately cease and no
Black-Out Period shall be re-instituted for so long as another holder of
Common Stock is permitted to sell shares of Common Stock under such
Registration Statement or such Underwritten Offering is ongoing, (2) the
Stockholders shall be permitted to resume the use of any effective Shelf
Registration Statement for resales of Registrable Shares or to recommence an
Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Demand Registration, (3) the obligation of
the Company to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 5.1(a),
or to effect any Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 5.1(b), or
any Demand Registration pursuant to Section 5.2(a), shall immediately
recommence, and (4) the Stockholders shall be permitted to participate
pursuant to Section 5.7 in a new Registration Statement filed by the Company
during the Black-Out Period pursuant to Section 5.7 for the offering of
Common Stock for the account of any holder of shares of Common Stock (other
than the Stockholders). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if a Stockholder determines to rescind any prior Underwritten
Offering Request or Demand Notice following receipt of a notice from the
Company pursuant to this Section 5.7, then such Stockholder may, at its
election, give written notice of such election to the Company;  _provided,
however,_ that such rescinded Underwritten Offering Request or Demand Notice
shall not be counted as an Underwritten Offering Request or Demand Notice for
purposes of the limits in Section 5.1(b) and Section 5.2(a), respectively.

(b) In the event of any suspension pursuant to this Section 5.11, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Stockholders
apprised of the estimated length of the anticipated delay and such

 



22  information shall be kept confidential and used by the Stockholders solely
for purposes of planning in connection with the exercise of their rights
hereunder. The Company will notify the Stockholders promptly upon the
termination of the Black-Out Period. Upon notice by the Company to the
Stockholders of any determination to commence a Black-Out Period, the
Stockholders shall, except as required by applicable Law, including
any disclosure obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, keep the
fact of any such Black-Out Period strictly confidential, and during any Black-
Out Period, promptly halt any offer, sale, trading or transfer of any shares
of Common Stock for the duration of the Black-Out Period under the applicable
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement until the Company has
provided notice to the Stockholders that the Black-Out Period has been
terminated or it has otherwise terminated as set forth in Section 5.11(a).

(c) After the expiration of any Black-Out Period and without any further
request from any Stockholder, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable prepare a Registration Statement or post-effective amendment or
supplement to the applicable Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus, or
any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable
Shares included therein, the prospectus will not include an untrue statement
of material fact or omit to statement any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the case of any prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or be not effective
and useable for resale of Registrable Shares.

 

Section 5.12 _Obligations of the Stockholders_.

 

(a) Each Stockholder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding
such Stockholder and its partners and members, and the distribution proposed
by such Stockholder, as the Company may reasonably request and as shall be
reasonably requested in connection with any registration, qualification or
compliance referred to in this Article V.

 

(b) In the event that, either immediately prior to or subsequent to the
effectiveness of any Registration Statement, any Stockholder shall distribute
Registrable Shares to its stockholders, partners or members, such Stockholder
shall so advise the Company and provide such information as shall be necessary
or advisable to permit an amendment to such Registration Statement or
supplement to any prospectus to provide information with respect to such
stockholders, partners or members, in their capacity as selling security
holders. As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of such
information, the Company shall file an appropriate amendment to such
Registration Statement or supplement to any prospectus reflecting the
information so provided. Any incremental expense to the Company resulting from
such amendment shall be borne by such Stockholder.

 

Section 5.13 _No Grants of Other Registration Rights_. The Company shall not
grant any demand, piggyback or shelf registration rights the terms of which
are senior to or conflict with the rights granted to the holders or
Registrable Shares hereunder to any other Person without the prior written
consent of the Stockholder.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION and CONTRIBUTION

 

Section 6.1 _Indemnification; Contribution_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and it hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless
each Stockholder (which, for purposes of this Article VI, shall be deemed to
include each holder of Registrable Shares) and its controlled Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, members, employees, managers, partners,
accountants, attorneys and agents and each Person who controls (within the
meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) such Persons, in any
offering or sale of the Registrable Shares, from and against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, actions or proceedings (whether commenced or
threatened) in respect thereof and expenses (including reasonable fees of
counsel) (collectively, "Claims") to which each such indemnified party may

 



23  become subject, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid in
settlement effected with the consent of the Company as provided herein), or
actions or proceedings in respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon (i)
an untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any registration
statement used to register Registrable Shares pursuant to this Agreement or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by
reference therein, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and (ii) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
in any prospectus or preliminary prospectus used to register Registrable
Shares pursuant to this Agreement or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and the Company shall, and it
hereby agrees to, reimburse periodically the indemnified person for any legal
or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such Claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be liable to any such Person in any such case only to the
extent that any such Claims arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
registration statement, or preliminary or final prospectus, or amendment or
supplement thereto, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by the Stockholder Group expressly for
use therein. The members of the Stockholder Group shall, and hereby agree,
severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its directors, officers, employees and each Person who controls (within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) such Persons, if any, in
any offering or sale of Registrable Shares, against any Claims to which each
such indemnified party may become subject, insofar as such Claims (including
any amounts paid in settlement as provided herein), or actions or proceedings
in respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact in any registration statement used to
register Registrable Shares pursuant to this Agreement or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference
therein, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and
(ii) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in
any prospectus or preliminary prospectus used to register Registrable Shares
pursuant to this Agreement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or
any document incorporated by reference therein, or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, in each case only to the extent that such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Company by the Stockholder Group expressly for use therein, and (ii)
reimburse the Company for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses
reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or
defending any such Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the
Stockholder Group shall be liable under this Section 6.1(a) for amounts in
excess of the proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions)
received by such holder in the offering giving rise to such liability.

(b) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 6.1(a) or
Section 6.1(b) of written notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding for which indemnification under Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(b)
may be requested, such indemnified party shall notify such indemnifying party
in writing of the commencement of such action or proceeding; but the omission
so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to any indemnified party in respect of such action or
proceeding hereunder unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced
by such failure of the indemnified party to give such notice, and in no event
shall such omission relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability
it may have to such indemnified party. In case any such action or proceeding
shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall
be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall determine,
jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying
party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable

 



24  costs of investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the
indemnifying party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently the action or proceeding within 20 days after receiving notice
from such indemnified party that the indemnified party believes it has failed
to do so; (ii) if such indemnified party who is a defendant in any action or
proceeding which is also brought against the indemnifying party reasonably
shall have concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to
such indemnified party which are not available to the indemnifying party; or
(iii) if representation of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, then, in any
such case, the indemnified party shall have the right to assume or continue
its own defense as set forth above (but with no more than one firm of counsel
for all indemnified parties in each jurisdiction) and the indemnifying party
shall be liable for any expenses therefor (including, without limitation, any
such reasonable counsels fees). If the indemnifying party is not entitled to,
or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for each indemnified party
with respect to such claim. The indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No indemnifying party shall, without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, compromise or consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement agreement with respect to
any action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought under
Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(b) (whether or not the indemnified party is an
actual or potential party thereto), unless such compromise, consent or
settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all
liability in respect of such claim or litigation, does not subject the
indemnified party to any material injunctive relief or other
material equitable remedy and does not include a statement or admission of
fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified
party.

 

(c) The members of the Stockholder Group and the Company agree that if, for
any reason, the indemnification provisions contemplated by Sections 6.1(a) or
6.1(b) hereof are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any Claims referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of, the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to such
offering of securities. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and
indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied
by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission. If, however, the allocation in the
second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
such relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6.1(c) were to be
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the
preceding sentences of this Section 6.1(c). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be deemed
to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.1(b) hereof) any
legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party
in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or
claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of the Stockholder Group shall be
required to make a contribution in excess of the amount received by such
person from the sale of its Registrable Shares in connection with the
offering that gave rise to the contribution obligation.

in favor of) any transaction resulting in a Change of Control in which any
member of the Stockholder Group receives per share consideration in its
capacity as a holder of Common Stock of the Company in excess of that to be

ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 10.1 _Injunctive Relief_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it would
be impossible to determine the amount of damages that would result from any
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement and that the remedy at law
for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of such provisions would likely
be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that each other party shall,
in addition to any other rights or remedies which it may have, be entitled to
seek such equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court
of competent jurisdiction to compel specific performance of, or restrain any
party from violating, any of such provisions. In connection with any action
or proceeding for injunctive relief, each party hereto hereby waives the claim
or defense that a remedy at law alone is adequate and agrees, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, to have each provision of this Agreement
specifically enforced against it, without the necessity of posting bond or
other security against it, and consents to the entry of injunctive relief
against it enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened breach of such
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 10.2 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Company and by
the Stockholder and the members of the Stockholder Group and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and no such term or provision is for the
benefit of, or intended to create any obligations to, any other Person,
except (i) that the Persons indemnified under Article VI are

 



26  intended third party beneficiaries of Article VI, (ii) that Non-Liable
Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of Section 10.12 and (iii) as
otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor
any rights or obligations hereunder shall be assignable without the consent of
the other party other than in connection with a Distribution.

 

Section 10.3 _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended only by an
agreement in writing executed by the parties hereto. Either party may waive
in whole or in part any benefit or right provided to it under this Agreement,
such waiver being effective only if contained in a writing executed by the
waiving party. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance
of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or remedy consequent upon breach thereof shall constitute a waiver
of any such breach or of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition,
nor shall any delay or omission of either party to exercise any right
hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right accruing to it
thereafter.

 

Section 10.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
to have been duly given when delivered in accordance with the following
clauses (i) and (ii): (i) by email to the parties at the following email
addresses (or at such other email address for a party as shall be specified by
like notice) and (ii) by email and hand delivery to the parties counsel at
the following email addresses and street addresses (or at such other email

Section 10.5 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue._

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, to the
extent such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (such
courts collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or action
relating to the Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Courts, (iv)
agrees that each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any action
or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the Delaware Courts,
(v) expressly and irrevocably waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any
objection to the laying of venue of any action arising out of the Agreement in
the Delaware Courts or that any such action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (vi) consents to service of process
in the manner set forth in Section 10.4. Each of parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 

Section 10.6 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the several sections in
this Agreement are for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.7 _Integration_. This Agreement and the other writings referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto which form a part hereof contain the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter. This
Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to its subject matter.

 

Section 10.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this Section with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 



29 Section 10.10 _WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF THE AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 

Section 10.11 _Outside Activities_.

 

(a) Subject to subsections (c) and (d) below, the Stockholder Group, General
Atlantic, any GA Investor, KKR, any KKR Investor and any of their respective
Affiliates may engage in or possess any interest in other investments,
business ventures or Persons of any nature or description, independently or
with others, similar or dissimilar to, or that competes with, the
investments or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and may
provide advice and other assistance to any such investment, business venture
or Person (such activities, the " _Competitive Activities_ ").

 

(b) The Company shall have no rights by virtue of this Agreement in and to
such investments, business ventures or Persons or the income or profits
derived therefrom.

(c) The pursuit of any Competitive Activities, even if competitive with the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall not be deemed
wrongful or improper and shall not constitute a conflict of interest or breach
of fiduciary or other duty in respect of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
Investors. None of the Stockholder Group, General Atlantic, the GA Investors,
KKR, the KKR Investors or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
obligated to present any particular investment or business opportunity to the
Company even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the
Company, could be pursued by the Company, and each of the Stockholder Group,
General Atlantic, the GA Investors, KKR, the KKR Investors and any of their
respective Affiliates shall have the right to pursue for its own account
(individually or as a partner or a fiduciary) or to recommend to any other
Person any such investment opportunity; _provided_ , that a Stockholder
Director who is offered an investment or business opportunity in his or her
capacity as a member of the Board shall be obligated to communicate such
opportunity to the Company, in which case the Stockholder Group, General
Atlantic, the GA Investors, KKR, the KKR Investors and their respective
Affiliates, respectively, shall not be permitted to pursue such opportunity
unless the Board determines not to do so.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Stockholder Group, General
Atlantic, the GA Investors, KKR, the KKR Investors or any of their respective
Affiliates may use any confidential information regarding the Company in
connection with any Competitive Activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary herein, the Company acknowledges that certain
industry knowledge may be acquired by the Stockholder Group, General Atlantic,
the GA Investors, KKR, the KKR Investors and their respective representatives
in connection with their access to confidential information that cannot be
separated from their overall knowledge and the Company acknowledges and agrees
this knowledge shall be permitted to be used in the ordinary course of
business of the Stockholder Group, General Atlantic, the GA Investors, KKR,
the KKR Investors and their respective representatives.

Section 10.12 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement, and notwithstanding the fact that any party
hereto may be a partnership or limited liability company, each party hereto,
by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that no Persons other than the named parties hereto shall
have any obligation hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder
against, and no recourse hereunder or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith shall be had against, any
former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate,

 



30  manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary,
representative or employee of the Stockholder or any Investor (or any of their
heirs, successors or permitted assigns), or against any former, current or
future director, officer, agent, employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee,
incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, representative, general or
limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of any of the foregoing
Persons, but in each case not including the named parties hereto (each, a "
_Non-Liable Person_ "), whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
by or on behalf of such party against any Non-Liable Person, by the
enforcement of any assignment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law or otherwise; it
being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever
shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Liable
Person, as such, for any obligations of the applicable party under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based
on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. The
parties acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements of the Stockholder (including, following any Distribution,
any Investor that becomes a party to this Agreement in accordance with its
terms), KKR, General Atlantic or any Investor shall be several and not joint
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as applicable, of the
Stockholder, KKR, General Atlantic or such Investor, as applicable.

Section 10.13 _No Adverse Actions_. Until such time as the Stockholder, the
KKR Investors, or the GA Investors no longer have the right to designate, or
cause the Stockholder to designate, as applicable, a Stockholder Nominee for
nomination to the Board pursuant to Section 3.4, without the prior written
consent of (i) the Stockholder (but only if the Stockholder has the right to
designate a Stockholder Nominee for nomination to the Board pursuant to
Section 3.4), or (ii) after a Distribution, (x) the KKR Investors (but only if
the KKR Investors have the right to designate a Stockholder Nominee for
nomination to the Board pursuant to Section 3.4) and (y) the GA Investors (but
only if the GA Investors have the right to designate a Stockholder Nominee for
nomination to the Board pursuant to Section 3.4), except as required by
applicable law, the Company shall not take any action to cause the amendment
of its Charter or Bylaws such that any of the rights provided to the
Stockholder, KKR, the KKR Investors, General Atlantic or the GA Investors
under this Agreement would be adversely effected. In the event that any
action that would violate the foregoing sentence becomes the subject of a
stockholder vote, the provisions of Section 3.3 shall not apply to such matter
and the Stockholder shall be entitled to vote all of its shares of Common
Stock in its discretion with respect to such matter.

 



31 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed
by their respective authorized officers as of the date set forth at the head
of this Agreement.
