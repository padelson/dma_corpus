hereby undertake to furnish supplementally to the Securities and Exchange

by the Securities and Exchange Commission _ AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of July 15, 2008, by and among VIROPHARMA INCORPORATED (" _Buyer_ "),
a Delaware corporation; HAE ACQUISITION CORP. (" _Sub_ "), a Delaware
corporation; and LEV PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (" _Target_ "), a
Delaware corporation.

_Preamble_

The board of directors of Target has determined that it is in the best
interests of Target and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter
into this Agreement with Buyer and Sub. The board of directors of Sub and
Buyer have determined that it is in the best interests of Buyer and Sub and
their respective stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement with Target. This Agreement provides for the acquisition of Target
by Buyer pursuant to the merger of Sub with and into Target. At the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of the capital stock of Target shall be converted
into the right to receive a cash payment from Buyer (including contingent cash
payments pursuant to the CVRs) and shares of the common stock of Buyer
(except as provided herein). As a result, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, stockholders of Target shall become stockholders
of Buyer, and Target shall continue to conduct its business and operations as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. The transactions described in this
Agreement are subject to the approval of the stockholders of Target, the
expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act and
the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement.

The board of directors of Buyer has unanimously approved this Agreement, the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement in substantially the form attached as
_Exhibit 1_ (the " _CVR Agreement_ ") to be entered into by Target and Buyer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

The boards of directors of Target and Sub have unanimously approved this
Agreement and the CVR Agreement and determined to recommend to their
respective stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (as amended, the " _DGCL_ ").

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition
and inducement to Buyers willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
of the holders of the outstanding shares of Target Common Stock have executed
and delivered to Buyer an agreement in substantially the form of _Exhibit 2_
(the " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which they have agreed, among other
things, subject to the terms of such Voting Agreement, to vote the shares of
Target Common Stock over which such Persons have voting power to approve
and adopt this Agreement.

Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1
of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the
Parties agree as follows: ARTICLE 1

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (excluding the conditions that, by
their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at Closing) set forth in Article

or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties. The

ARTICLE 3

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES



     | 3.1 | Conversion of Shares. 
---|---|--- 

Subject to the provisions of this Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Target, Sub or the
stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows: 

(a) The shares of capital stock of Buyer shall not be converted or exchanged
in any manner, but each share of capital stock of Buyer issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue from and
after the Effective Time to represent one issued and outstanding share of
Buyer.

(b) Each share of Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(c) Each share of Target Common Stock (excluding shares held by any Target
Entity or any Buyer Entity, and excluding shares held by stockholders
who perfect their statutory dissenters rights as provided in Section 3.4)
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall be converted into and
exchanged for the right to receive (i) that number of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the quotient
determined by dividing $0.50 by the Average Closing Price and rounding the
result to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ");
_provided_ , that if the Average Closing Price is less than $10.03, the
Exchange Ratio will be 0.050, and if the Average Closing Price is greater than
$15.68, the Exchange Ratio will be 0.032 (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), (ii)
a cash payment in the amount of $2.25 per share, without interest (the "
_Cash Consideration_ "), and (iii) one contingent value right (a " _CVR_ ")
which shall represent the right to receive the First CVR Payment Amount of
$0.50 per share and the Second CVR Payment Amount of $0.50 per share (each as
defined in the CVR Agreement), if any, in cash. The Stock Consideration, Cash
Consideration and CVR to be received in respect of each share of
Target Common Stock pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) are collectively referred
to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ". " _Average Closing Price_ " means the
average of the daily closing prices for the shares of Buyer Common Stock for
the 20 consecutive trading days on which such shares are actually traded on
the Nasdaq Stock Market (as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if not
reported thereby, any other authoritative source reasonably selected
by Buyer) ending at the close of trading on the second trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date).

(d) Pursuant to the Buyer Rights Agreement, each share of Buyer Common Stock
issued in connection with the Merger upon conversion of Target Common Stock
shall be accompanied by a Buyer Right.



 

3 ---|---|--- 

If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Target Common Stock or Buyer Common Stock shall have
been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, split, combination,
contribution or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration and any
adjustments or payments to be made under Section 3.6 and any other number or
amount contained herein which is based upon the price of Buyer Common Stock,
including the Average Closing Price, or the number of shares of Target Common
Stock or Buyer Common Stock, as the case may be, shall be correspondingly
adjusted to provide the holders of Target Common Stock, Target Options and
other awards under the Target Option Plan, the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that with
respect to Target Options and other awards made under the Target Option Plan,
any such adjustments shall be made only to the extent required under the
applicable Target Option Plan.



     | 3.3 | Shares Held by Target or Buyer. 
---|---|--- 

Each of the shares of Target Common Stock held by any Target Entity
(including shares of Target Common Stock held in treasury by Target) or by any
Buyer Entity shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.



     | 3.4 | Dissenting Stockholders. 
---|---|--- 

Any holder of shares of Target Common Stock who perfects such holders
dissenters rights in accordance with and as contemplated by Section 262 of
the DGCL shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation the value
of such shares in cash as determined pursuant to such provision of Law;
provided, that no such payment shall be made to any dissenting stockholder
unless and until such dissenting stockholder has complied with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and surrendered to Target the shares for which payment
is being made. In the event that after the Effective Time a dissenting
stockholder of Target fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses,
such holders right to appraisal of and payment for such holders shares,
Buyer shall issue and deliver the consideration to which such holder of shares
of Target Common Stock is entitled under this Article 3 (without interest)
upon surrender by such holder of the shares of Target Common Stock held by
such holder.



     | 3.5 | Fractional Shares. 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Target Common Stock or Target Options exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer
Common Stock (after taking into account all shares delivered by such holder
and aggregating all fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be received by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock
multiplied by the Average Closing Price. No such holder will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of
any fractional shares.



     | 3.6 | Stock Options and Restricted Stock. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Each option to purchase one share of Target Common Stock granted by
Target, whether granted pursuant to the Target Option Plan (individually a "
_Target Plan Option_ ") or otherwise (collectively, including Target Plan
Options, the " _Target Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Target Option, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive: (i) the Stock  



 

4  Consideration, (ii) a cash amount equal to the Cash Consideration less the
applicable exercise price per share of such Target Option, and (iii) a CVR
(the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be subject to
reduction for applicable withholding taxes, with such reduction occurring
first from the Cash Consideration portion of the Option Consideration and
then the Stock Consideration portion of the Option Consideration (based on the
Average Closing Price).

(b) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, any then outstanding
shares of restricted Target Common Stock issued pursuant to the Employment
Agreements (the " _Restricted Stock_ ") shall become fully vested and all
restrictions thereon shall lapse and, at the Effective Time, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) The board of directors of Target or a committee of Non-Employee Directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time
providing that the disposition by the officers and directors of Target of
Target Common Stock, Target Options or other equity securities of Target
pursuant to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act. 

ARTICLE 4

EXCHANGE OF SHARES



     | 4.1 | Exchange Procedures. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with the Buyers
transfer agent or another exchange agent selected by Buyer and which is
reasonably acceptable to Target (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in
accordance with this Section 4.1, the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement, cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of
the aggregate Cash Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than two business days after the Effective Time, Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of either certificated shares (such certificates, the " _Certificate_ "
or " _Certificates_ ") or uncertificated shares (the " _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,
appropriate transmittal materials and instructions (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent). Each holder of
shares of Target Common Stock that have been converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Target Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may require or (ii)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of book-entry of Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Target Common Stock represented by
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that are not registered in the transfer
records of Target, the consideration provided in Section 3.1 may be issued to
a transferee if the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the
Exchange Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt
of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to
be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity
as Buyer and the Exchange Agent may reasonably require and (iii) any other
documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof, the
Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the consideration into which the
shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate
shall have been converted. The  



 

5  Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules and
procedures in connection with its duties as it may deem appropriate. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Exchange Agent, in connection with the distribution of the consideration
provided in Section 3.1.

(b) After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Target Common Stock
(other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 or as to
which statutory dissenters rights have been perfected as provided in Section
3.4) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender or transfer
the Certificate or Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares to the Exchange Agent and shall promptly upon surrender thereof
receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided in Section 3.1. Buyer
shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former
holder of Target Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until
such holder surrenders or transfers such holders Certificate or Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1.

(c) Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Target Common Stock such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
any amounts are so withheld by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Target Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be. Any such withholding shall be made first from the
Cash Consideration and second from the Stock Consideration.

(d) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed
by the holders of Target Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation (together with any dividends or
earnings in respect thereof). Any holders of Target Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter be entitled to look
only to Buyer, and only as a general creditor thereof, for payment of the
consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Target Common Stock such
holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without
any interest thereon.

(e) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder
of Target Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. 



     | 4.2 | Rights of Former Target Stockholders. 
---|---|--- 

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Target shall be closed as
to holders of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and
no transfer of Target Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made
or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.1, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share
theretofore representing shares of Target Common Stock (other than shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 or as to which statutory dissenters
rights have been perfected as provided in Section 3.4) shall from and after
the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
consideration provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.6 in exchange therefor, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which have been declared or made by Target in respect of such shares
of Target Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this  



 

6  Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Whenever a dividend
or other distribution is declared by Buyer on the Buyer Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of Buyer Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other
distribution payable to the holders of record of Buyer Common Stock as of any
time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any
Certificate or Uncertificated Share until such holder surrenders such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share for exchange as provided in Section 4.1.
However, upon surrender of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share, both the
Buyer Common Stock certificate (together with all such undelivered dividends
or other distributions without interest) and any undelivered dividends and
cash payments payable hereunder (without interest) shall be delivered and paid
with respect to each share represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share. To the extent permitted by Law, former holders of record of shares of
Target Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any
meeting of Buyer stockholders the number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
into which their respective shares of Target Common Stock are converted,
regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing Target Common Stock for shares of Buyer
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided,
that beginning 30 days after the Effective Time no such holder shall be
entitled to vote on any matter until such holder surrenders such Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares for exchange as provided in this Article 4.

Material Adverse Effect.



     | 5.2 | Authority of Target; No Breach By Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Target has the corporate power and authority necessary to execute,
deliver, and, other than with respect to consummation of the Merger, perform

which is the only stockholder vote required for approval of this Agreement and
consummation of the Merger by Target. Subject to such stockholder approval of
this Agreement, this Agreement represents a legal, valid, and binding
obligation of Target, enforceable against Target in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable

consummation by Target of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance
by Target with any of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or result
in a breach of any provision of Targets certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or other
governing documents of any Target Subsidiary, (ii) except as disclosed in

referred to in Section 9.1(c), constitute or result in a Default under, or
require any Consent pursuant to, any Law, Order, Permit or Contract applicable
to any Target Entity or any of their respective material Assets, except, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, where such Default or Lien, or the
failure to obtain such Consent, is not reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Target Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) Other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws (including
filing the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL), and the rules of the
OTC Bulletin Board or Nasdaq, and other than Consents required from Regulatory
Authorities, and other than notices to or filings with the IRS or the

Securities Laws and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or, if amended

date of such filing or, in the case of registration statements, at the
effective date thereof) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such Target SEC

order for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Target to

procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Target in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and

regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of Target required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received
a favorable determination letter from the IRS that is still in effect and
applies to the Target ERISA Plan as amended and as administered or, within
the time permitted under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(b), has timely

retroactively to the Target ERISA Plan as amended and as administered. Target
is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter. Target has not received any communication
(written or unwritten) from any government agency questioning or challenging
the compliance of any Target Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. No Target
Benefit Plan is currently being audited by a governmental agency for
compliance with applicable Laws or has been audited with a determination by
the governmental agency that the Employee Benefit Plan failed to comply with
applicable Laws.

direct or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any
fiduciary, co-fiduciary or other duty under ERISA. There are no unresolved

or unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations, summary
annual reports, and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to the
Target Benefit Plans are materially correct and complete, have been timely
filed with the IRS, the DOL or distributed to participants of the Target
Benefit Plans (as required by Law), and there have been no changes in the
information set forth therein.

of the Internal Revenue Code (" _COBRA_ ") or similar state law. No Target
Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare benefit plan is self-insured. 

(h) Except as disclosed in Section 5.14(h) of the Target Disclosure
Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
material payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of any
Target Entity from any Target Entity under any Target Benefit Plan or
otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Target Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of

affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, nor the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance

Consent pursuant to, any Law or Order applicable to any Buyer Entity or any
of their respective material Assets, except in case of clauses (ii) and (iii)
where such Default or Lien, or any failure to obtain such Consent, is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) Other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws (including
filing the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL), and the rules of the
OTC Bulletin or Nasdaq, and other than Consents required from Regulatory

any Lien. Each Buyer Subsidiary is a corporation, limited liability
company, limited partnership, or limited liability partnership, and is duly
organized, validly existing, and (as to corporations) in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized, and has
the power and authority necessary for it to own, lease and operate its Assets

order for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Buyer to
engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act and

and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Buyer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and

balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Property licenses. No proceedings have been instituted, or are pending or to

Entity with respect to Intellectual Property used, sold or licensed by such
Buyer Entity in the course of its business, nor has any person claimed or
alleged any rights to such Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Buyer,
the conduct of the business of the Buyer Entities does not infringe any valid
and/or enforceable Intellectual Property of any other person. No Buyer Entity
is obligated to pay any recurring royalties to any Person with respect to any
such Intellectual Property. Every officer, director, or employee of any Buyer
Entity is a party to a Contract which requires such officer, director or
employee to assign any interest in any Intellectual Property to a Buyer Entity
and to keep confidential any trade secrets, proprietary data, customer
information, or other business information of a Buyer Entity, and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, no such officer, director or employee is party to any

Property to any Person other than a Buyer Entity or to keep confidential any
trade secrets, proprietary data, customer information, or other business
information of any Person other than a Buyer Entity, except for such
Contracts which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

---|---|--- 

Each Buyer Entity has in effect all Permits necessary for it to own, lease or
operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except where
the failure to be in effect is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. None of the Buyer
Entities:

(a) is in Default under any of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or other governing instruments);

(b) is in Default under any Laws, Orders or Permits applicable to its business
or employees conducting its business, except for Defaults which are not

Adverse Effect; or

(c) since December 31, 2005, has received any notification or communication
from any agency or department of federal, state, or local government or any
Regulatory Authority or the staff thereof (i) asserting that any Buyer
Entity is not, or may not be, in compliance with any Laws or Orders, where
such noncompliance is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or (ii) threatening to revoke any
Permits, the revocation of which is reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.



     | 6.12 | Labor Relations. 
---|---|--- 

No Buyer Entity is the subject of any Litigation asserting that it or any
other Buyer Entity has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning
of the National Labor Relations Act or comparable state Law) or other
violation of state or federal labor Law or seeking to compel it or any other
Buyer Entity to bargain with any labor organization or other employee
representative as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is any Buyer
Entity party to any collective bargaining agreement or  



 

28  subject to any bargaining order, injunction or other Order relating to
Buyers relationship or dealings with its employees, any labor organization
or any other employee representative. There is no material strike, slowdown,
lockout or other job action or labor dispute involving any Buyer Entity
pending or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened and there has been no such
actions or disputes in the past five years. To the Knowledge of Buyer, in the
past five years there has not been any attempt by any Buyer employees or any
labor organization or other employee representative to organize or certify a
collective bargaining unit or to engage in any other union organization
activity with respect to Buyers workforce.

---|---|--- 

Buyer has delivered or made available to Target prior to the execution of
this Agreement, a complete list of all Employee Benefit Plans currently
adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, on contributed to by
any Buyer Entity for the benefit of Buyers employees. Each Employee Benefit
Plan has been maintained, operated, and administered in compliance with its
terms and all applicable Laws in all material respects. Each Employee Benefit
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code is the subject of an IRS determination or opinion letter regarding such
qualified status.



     | 6.14 | Material Contracts. 
---|---|--- 

Except as disclosed in Section 6.14 of the Buyer Disclosure Memorandum or
otherwise reflected in the Buyer Financial Statements, none of the Buyer

or amendment thereto that would be required to be filed as an exhibit to a
Form 10-K filed by Buyer with the SEC as of the date of this Agreement that

year ended December 31, 2007, or in an SEC Document (together with all
Contracts referred to in Section 6.10, the " _Buyer Contracts_ "). With
respect to each Buyer Contract (which includes the Buyer Rights Agreement)
and except as disclosed in Section 6.14 of the Buyer Disclosure Memorandum:

---|---|--- 

There is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
threatened (or unasserted but considered probable of assertion and which if
asserted would have at least a reasonable possibility of an unfavorable
outcome) against any Buyer Entity, or against any director, employee or
employee benefit plan of any Buyer Entity, or against any Asset, interest, or
right of any of them, that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, nor are there any Orders
outstanding against any Buyer Entity, that is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Each Party agrees to promptly notify the other Party upon becoming aware of
any material developments in its business and the occurrence or impending
occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of its
Subsidiaries that (a) is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Target Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



     | 8.1 | Registration Statement; Proxy Statement; Stockholder
Approval. 
---|---|--- 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after execution of this Agreement,
Buyer shall prepare and file the Registration Statement with the SEC, and
Target shall prepare and file with the SEC a Proxy Statement and mail such
Proxy Statement to its stockholders in connection with the Stockholders
Meeting (together with the Registration Statement, the " _Proxy/Prospectus_
"), and Buyer and Target shall use their respective reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act,
and the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC, as promptly as practicable.
Buyer shall take any action required to be taken under the applicable state
Blue Sky or securities Laws in connection with the issuance of the shares of
Buyer Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger. Each of Buyer and Target
shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of the Proxy/Prospectus and
shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital
stock as may be necessary in connection with the Proxy/Prospectus. Buyer and
Target shall timely and properly make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Laws, including filings required under SEC
Rules 165, 425 and 14a-12. Buyer will advise Target, promptly after Buyer
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Buyer
Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement shall have become effective and the Proxy Statement
shall be cleared by the SEC, Target shall mail or otherwise make available in
accordance with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the Proxy/Prospectus
to its stockholders; provided, that Target and Buyer shall consult and
cooperate with each other in determining the appropriate time for mailing or
otherwise making available to Targets stockholders the Proxy/Prospectus in
light of the date set for the Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Target shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a Stockholders
Meeting, to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective and the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC, on a date reasonably acceptable to Buyer, for the purpose of voting upon
the approval and adoption of this Agreement (" _Target Stockholder Approval_
"), and such other related matters as it deems appropriate and shall, subject
to the provisions of this Section 8.1, through its board of directors,
recommend to its stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
use its reasonable efforts to obtain the Target Stockholder
Approval, provided that Target may extend the date of the Stockholders
Meeting to the extent (x) necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its
stockholders or (y) Target reasonably determines that such delay is required
by applicable Law. 

(c) Neither the board of directors of Target nor any committee thereof shall
(i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 8.1, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Buyer, the approval or recommendation of such board of directors or
such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
cause Target to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that, prior to the adoption and approval of this
Agreement by the holders of Target Common Stock, the board of directors of
Target determines in good faith, after it has received a Superior Offer and
after consultation  



 

35  with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to Target stockholders under applicable Law, then the
board of directors of Target may (subject to this and the following
sentences) inform Target stockholders that it no longer believes that the
Merger is advisable and no longer recommends approval and may (subject to this
and the following sentences) approve or recommend a Superior Proposal (and in
connection therewith withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger (a " _Subsequent Determination_ ")), but only at a
time that is after the third business day following Buyers receipt of
written notice advising Buyer that the board of directors of Target has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal (and including a copy thereof with all accompanying
documentation, if in writing), identifying the person making such Superior
Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Subsequent Determination. Buyer
shall have three business days from the date of receiving such notice to
submit to Target any changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable Target to proceed with its recommendation to its stockholders
without a Subsequent Determination; provided, that any such adjustment shall
be at the discretion of the Parties at the time.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Target shall submit
this Agreement to its stockholders at its Stockholders Meeting even if the
board of directors of Target determines at any time after the date hereof that
it is no longer advisable or recommends that Target stockholders reject it.



     | 8.2 | Other Offers, Etc. 
---|---|--- 

(a) No Target Entity shall, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates or Representatives to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate, induce or knowingly encourage the making, submission or announcement
of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person or "Group" (as such term is
defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) any nonpublic information
with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) except as expressly permitted in Section
8.1(c), approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) enter
into any Acquisition Agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction; _provided_ , that this Section 8.2(a) shall not
prohibit a Target Entity from furnishing nonpublic information regarding
any Target Entity to, or entering into a confidentiality agreement or
discussions or negotiations with, any Person or Group in response to a bona
fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or
Group (and not withdrawn) if (A) no Target Entity or Representative or
Affiliate thereof shall have violated in any material respect any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 8.2, (B) the board of directors of
Target determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and Target Financial Advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (C) the board of
directors of Target determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to Target stockholders under applicable Law, as such
duties would exist in the absence of this Section 8.2, (D) (1) at least two
business days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person or Group, Target
gives Buyer written notice of the identity of such Person or Group and of
Targets intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person or Group, and (2) Target
receives from such Person or Group an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms no less favorable to the disclosing Party than the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement and (E) contemporaneously with furnishing any
such nonpublic information to such Person or Group, Target furnishes such
nonpublic information to Buyer (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously furnished by Target to Buyer). In addition to the
foregoing, Target shall provide Buyer with at least two business days prior
written notice of a meeting of the board of directors of Target at which
meeting the board of directors of Target is reasonably expected to resolve to
recommend a Superior  



 

36  Proposal to its stockholders and together with such notice a copy of the
most recently proposed documentation relating to such Superior Proposal;
provided, further, that Target hereby agrees promptly to provide to Buyer any
revised documentation and any Acquisition Agreement.

(b) In addition to the obligations of Target set forth in Section 8.2(a), as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within one business day after any of
the executive officers of Target become aware thereof, Target shall advise
Buyer of any request received by Target for nonpublic information which
Target reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or
Acquisition Proposal, and the identity of the Person or Group making any such
request or Acquisition Proposal. Target shall keep Buyer informed promptly of
material amendments or modifications to any such request or Acquisition
Proposal.

(c) The Target Entities shall immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.2,
by any Affiliate or Representative of any Target Entity shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 8.2 by Target.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its board of
directors from complying with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012
of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act.



     | 8.3 | Exchange Listing. 
---|---|--- 

Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to list, prior to the Effective Time,
on the Nasdaq Stock Market the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to
the holders of Target Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Buyer shall
give all notices and make all filings with Nasdaq required in connection with
the transactions contemplated herein.



     | 8.4 | Antitrust Notification; Consents of Regulatory Authorities. 
---|---|--- 

(a) To the extent required by the HSR Act, each of the Parties shall, as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, file with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of
Justice (" _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form required for the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall promptly file any supplemental or
additional information which may reasonably be requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, and shall comply in all
material respects with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each Party shall use
its reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted
with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
any other federal, state or foreign Law, regulation or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In
the event any Litigation is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as
violative of Antitrust Laws, each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to
avoid the filing of, or resist or resolve such Litigation. Each Party shall
use its reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required by: (i) the
DOJ and/or the FTC in order to resolve such objections as either of them may
have to the Merger under the Antitrust Laws; or (ii) any federal or state
court of the United States, or similar court of competent jurisdiction in any
foreign jurisdiction, in any suit brought by any Regulatory Authority or any
other Person challenging the Merger as violative of the Antitrust Laws, in
order to avoid the entry of any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Merger
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including this
Section 8.4, no Buyer Entity shall be required to divest, license,  



 

37  lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of or hold separate any of its or any of
Target Entitys businesses, product lines or Assets, or to take or agree
to take any other action or agree to any limitation that Buyer reasonably
determines to be material to Buyer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(b) The Parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings (which shall
include the filings pursuant to Section 8.4(a)), and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all Consents, actions, or non-actions of all Regulatory
Authorities and other Persons which are necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). Buyer
shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any
Regulatory Authority relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall
afford Target a reasonable opportunity to participate therein. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and Target shall: (i)
keep the other Party informed of any communication received from, or given to,
the FTC, DOJ, or any other United States or foreign Regulatory Authority and
of any communication received from or given to any Person (other than such
Partys employees, Representatives, or Affiliates) in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (ii) permit the other Party to review in advance any
communication given by the first Party to, and consult with the other Party in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, DOJ, or any other United
States or foreign Regulatory Authority or, in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, with any other Person (other than the employees, agents,
attorneys, representatives, advisors, consultants, or affiliates of Buyer,
Target, or their affiliates, as the case may be) and, to the extent permitted
by the FTC, DOJ, or any other United States or foreign Regulatory Authority or
other Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.



     | 8.5 | Filing with State Office.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Sub and
Target shall execute and file the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of

     | 8.6 | Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate. 
---|---|--- 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to
use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its
reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting its
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause to be
satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 9; provided, that nothing
herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its rights under
this Agreement.



     | 8.7 | Investigation and Confidentiality. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Each Party hereto shall permit the others reasonable access during normal
business hours to its and its Subsidiaries respective business and
properties, books, contracts, records and personnel having material knowledge
of the transactions contemplated hereby, provided however that each Party may
restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (i) any law, treaty, rule or
regulation of any governmental entity requires such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such personnel, properties
or information, (ii) such investigation shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) such access not interfere
unnecessarily with normal operations and (iv) such access would reasonably
likely to jeopardize such Partys attorney-client privilege. No investigation
by a  



 

38  Party shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on the representations
and warranties of the other Party. The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply
with respect to the information furnished thereunder and other activities
contemplated thereby.

(b) In addition to the Parties respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which are hereby reaffirmed and adopted, and
incorporated by reference herein each Party shall, and shall cause its
advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential
information furnished to it by the other Party concerning its and its
Subsidiaries businesses, operations, and financial positions and shall not
use such information for any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Effective Time, each Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of
all documents and copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential
information received from the other Party. 



     | 8.8 | Press Releases. 
---|---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, Target and Buyer shall consult with each other
as to the form and substance of any press release or other public disclosure
materially related to this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated
hereby; provided, that nothing in this Section 8.8 shall be deemed to
prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its counsel deems
necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Partys disclosure obligations
imposed by Law; provided, further, that each of Target and Buyer may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by Target and Buyer and do not reveal material, nonpublic information
regarding the other Parties.



      | 8.9 | State Takeover Laws. 
---|---|--- 

Each Target Entity and Buyer Entity shall take all necessary steps to exempt
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary to
challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law.



     | 8.10 | Charter Provisions. 
---|---|--- 

Each Target Entity shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant
of any rights to any Person under the certificates or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other governing instruments of any Target Entity or
restrict or impair the ability of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or
otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, shares of
any Target Entity that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled
by them.



     | 8.11 | Employee Benefits and Contracts. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At least one day prior to the Closing Date, Target shall take or cause to
be taken all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to terminate,
effective no later than the Closing, the Health Reimbursement Arrangement Plan
(the " _HRA Plan_ ") and any Target Benefit Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the " _Target 401(k) Plan_ ").
Target shall provide to Buyer prior to the Closing Date written evidence of
the adoption by Targets Board of Directors of resolutions authorizing the
termination of the Target 401(k) Plan (which resolutions shall be subject to
the prior review and approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).



 

39 (b) Buyer shall take such action as may be necessary so that for a twelve (12)
month period following the Closing Date, employees of a Target Entity who
remain employed by such Target Entity after the Closing (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") shall be provided employee benefits under employee benefit plans
(including but not limited to incentive compensation, life insurance,
welfare, 401(k), salary and fringe benefits but other than stock option or
other plans involving the potential issuance of Buyer Common Stock) which are
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Buyer Entities to their
similarly situated employees. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, grant Continuing Employees credit for all
service with the Target Entities prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) in all benefits provided by
Buyer to Continuing Employees. The eligibility of any Continuing Employee to
participate in any employee benefit plan of Buyer shall not be subject to any
exclusions for pre-existing conditions if such individual has met the
participation requirements of similar benefit plans and programs of the Target
Entities. Amounts paid before the Effective Time by Continuing Employees under
any health plans of the Target Entities shall, after the Effective Time, be
taken into account in applying deductible and annual out-of-pocket limits
applicable under the health plans of Buyer provided as of the Effective Time
to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid under such health plans
of Buyer. Buyer shall, and also cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to honor in accordance with their terms all employment,
severance, consulting and other compensation Contracts disclosed in Section
8.11 of the Target Disclosure Memorandum between any Target Entity and any
current or former director, officer, or employee thereof, and all provisions
for vested benefits or other vested amounts earned or accrued through the
Effective Time under the Target Benefit Plans.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.11 to the contrary, this
Section 8.11 shall not operate to be construed to mean the employment of the
Continuing Employees is not terminable by Surviving Corporation at will at any
time, with or without cause, for any reason or no reason.



     | 8.12 | Indemnification. 
---|---|--- 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Target
Entities (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all Liabilities arising
out of actions or omissions arising out of the Indemnified Partys service or
services as directors, officers, employees or agents of Target or, at Targets
request, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law and by Targets certificate of incorporation and bylaws
as in effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to advances of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation and whether or not any
Buyer Entity is insured against any such matter. 

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (and Target shall
cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) maintain in effect
for a period of six years after the Effective Time Targets existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy (provided that Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous in any material respects with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time
and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance; provided,
that neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to make
aggregate annual premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such
policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion
related to Targets directors and officers, 250% of the annual premium
payments on Targets current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors and officers liability insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.



 

40 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 8.12, upon learning of any such Liability or Litigation,
shall promptly notify Buyer and the Surviving Corporation thereof provided,
however, that no delay or failure on the part of any Indemnified Party in
notifying Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall relieve Buyer from any
obligation hereunder unless, and then solely to the extent that Buyer is
materially prejudiced thereby. In the event of any such Litigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither
Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Buyer or the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises
Buyer that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Buyer or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties if
there are additional defenses available to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; provided, that Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated pursuant to this Section 8.12(c) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation; and (iii)

Statement and the Proxy/Prospectus.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(i) if (1) another Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced and not
withdrawn, (2) Target or Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(d)(iii), and (3) within 12 months of such termination, Target shall
either (A) consummate an Acquisition Transaction or (B) enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction, whether or
not such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated (but changing, in
the case of (A) and (B), the references to the 10% and 90% amounts in the
definition of Acquisition Transaction to 50%);

(ii) if (1) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or
Section 10.1(h) and (2) within 9 months of such termination, Target shall
either (A) consummate an Acquisition Transaction or (B) enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction, whether or
not such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated (but changing,

definition of Acquisition Transaction to 50%); or

(iii) if (1) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(e) and

11.2(b)(ii)(2) is later satisfied the Termination Fee (less the amount of any
Expense Reimbursement that has been paid) shall also be paid. Target hereby
waives any right to set-off or counterclaim against such amounts. If the
Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to Section 11.2(b)(i), Section

Transaction.

(c) Target and Buyer acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section
11.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements, neither Target nor Buyer
would enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Target fails to pay promptly
any fee or amount payable by it pursuant to this Section 11.2, then Target
shall pay to Buyer its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in

amount of the fee or amount at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date
such payment was due under this Agreement until the date of payment.

As to any dispute, claim, or Litigation arising out of or relating in any way
to this Agreement or the transaction at issue in this Agreement, the
Parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any Delaware state court, or federal court of the United
States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, (a) any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
laying venue of any suit, action or proceeding brought in such court, (b) any
claim that any suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, and (c) any defense that it may now or
hereafter have based on lack of personal jurisdiction in such forum.

this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

executed on its behalf by its duly authorized officers as of the day and year
