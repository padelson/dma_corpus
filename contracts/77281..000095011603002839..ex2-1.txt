<PAGE>

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.6(a), PREIT is
not required at any time to nominate for election as a trustee of PREIT or
recommend Mark E. Pasquerilla or any other person in the management slate of
nominees if, at any time, such person is subject to (i) a criminal proceeding
(other than a traffic violation or other minor offense) resulting in an
indictment or a conviction, (ii) any order, judgment or decree that permanently
or temporarily enjoins or otherwise limits such person's participation or right
to engage in, continue any conduct or practice in connection with, or be
associated with any person who engages, in securities or commodities activities,
(iii) a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction, the SEC or the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission of a federal or state securities or commodities law
violation, which finding has not been subsequently reversed, suspended or
vacated, or (iv) a finding of liability by a court of competent jurisdiction for

Agreement, by the adoption by the PREIT Board of Trustees of the amendment to
the PREIT Trust Agreement ("PREIT Trust Amendment") in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E to provide for the authorization of the PREIT

Trustees in accordance with its terms as they determine to be necessary or
appropriate in order to permit the proposed terms and provisions of the PREIT
Trust Amendment to have effect under the PREIT Trust Agreement (the "Enabling
Trust Agreement Amendment").

the PREIT Senior Preferred Shares into which the Crown Senior Preferred Shares
are converted pursuant to Section 1.8(b), (C) any cash payable in lieu of any
fractional PREIT Common Shares pursuant to Section 1.11(g), and (D) any accrued
and unpaid dividends on the PREIT Senior Preferred Shares. Notwithstanding any
failure by holders of a Certificate to surrender such Certificate for a
certificate representing PREIT Common Shares or PREIT Senior Preferred Shares,
as applicable, from and after the Effective Time each such holder shall become a
holder of PREIT Common Shares or PREIT Senior Preferred Shares, as applicable,
upon conversion, as provided in this Section 1.8, and shall be accorded the same
rights as any other holder of PREIT Common Shares or PREIT Senior Preferred
Shares, as applicable, and such Certificate shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the consideration provided for in this Section 1.8(c).

                  1.9 Partner Approval. Crown shall seek the requisite approval
of the partners of Crown Partnership of this Agreement, the Merger, any
transactions or agreements contemplated by this Agreement that require approval
of such parties, and the withdrawal of Crown as general partner to the extent
required by the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, dated as

                           (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time,
PREIT shall appoint American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, or another bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Crown, to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the exchange of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates representing issued and outstanding Crown Common Shares and Crown
Senior Preferred Shares.

                           (b) PREIT to Provide Merger Consideration; Crown to
Provide Funds for Any Final Crown Dividend. PREIT shall provide to the Exchange
Agent on or before the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Crown
Common Shares and Crown Senior Preferred Shares, the Merger Consideration
issuable in exchange for the issued and outstanding Crown Common Shares and
Crown Senior Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 1.8, together with any cash
required to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.11(g) (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent (or other depository acting
for the benefit of the Exchange Agent, selected by PREIT and reasonably
satisfactory to Crown) shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by PREIT, on a daily basis. Any interest or other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to PREIT. If the Merger is terminated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such cash and any interest or other
income earned on such investment thereof shall be paid to PREIT. Crown shall
provide to the Exchange Agent not later than three business days prior to the
Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Crown Common Shares and Crown
Senior Preferred Shares, cash payable in respect of any dividends required
pursuant to Section 1.11(d)(i). Such cash shall be invested in accordance with
written directions delivered by Crown to the Exchange Agent (or any such other
depository) not later than three business days prior to the Effective Time, with
any interest or other income earned on such investments to be paid to PREIT as
the successor to Crown in the Merger. If the Merger is terminated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, such cash and any interest or other income
earned on such investment thereof shall be paid to Crown.

                           (c) Exchange Procedure. PREIT and PREIT Partnership
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent, no later
than the fifth (5th) business day after the Closing Date, to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Crown Common Shares or Crown Senior
Preferred Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as PREIT may
reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, (x) the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the
Crown Common Shares or Crown Senior Preferred Shares, as applicable, theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
1.8, including any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.11(g), (y) PREIT and PREIT Partnership shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail (or make available for collection by
hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) such amount to such holder within
five business days after receipt thereof, and (z) the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Crown
Common Shares or Crown Senior Preferred Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of Crown, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment either shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of such payment being made to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Crown
that such tax or taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 1.11, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the Crown
Common Shares or Crown Senior Preferred Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.8, including any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.11(g). No
interest will be paid or will accrue to the benefit of the shareholders on the
Merger Consideration or on any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.11(g). PREIT
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to deduct and withhold from the cash, PREIT Common Shares
or PREIT Senior Preferred Shares, or any combination thereof, that otherwise is
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Crown Common Shares or Crown
Senior Preferred Shares such amounts as PREIT or the Exchange Agent is required


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. For this purpose, any
PREIT Common Shares or PREIT Senior Preferred Shares deducted and withheld by
PREIT shall be valued at the last trading price of the PREIT Common Shares or
the PREIT Senior Preferred Shares, as applicable, on the New York Stock Exchange
on the Effective Date of the Merger (or in the event that the PREIT Senior
Preferred Shares do not yet trade on the New York Stock Exchange, at the
liquidation preference (excluding unpaid dividends) per PREIT Senior Preferred
Share). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by PREIT or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of the Crown Common Shares or Crown Senior
Preferred Shares, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by PREIT or the Exchange Agent.

                           (d) Provisions Relating to Record Dates for Final
Dividends.

                                  (i) If and to the extent necessary for Crown
to satisfy the requirements of Section 857(a)(1) of the Code for the taxable
year of Crown ending at the Effective Time and, if applicable, the preceding
taxable year (and to avoid the payment of any tax with respect to undistributed
income or gain), Crown shall declare a dividend (the "Final Crown Dividend") to
holders of Crown Common Shares and Crown Senior Preferred Shares, the record
date for which shall be not later than the close of business on the sixth
business day preceding the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the minimum
dividend sufficient to permit Crown to satisfy such requirements. Any dividends
payable hereunder to holders of Crown Common Shares and Crown Senior Preferred
Shares shall be paid on the third business day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. In the event that Crown is required to declare a Final Crown Dividend with
respect to the Crown Common Shares, Crown Partnership shall simultaneously
declare a distribution (the "Final Crown Partnership Distribution") to holders
of Crown OP Units in an amount per unit equal to the Final Crown Dividend
payable per Crown Common Share, together with any distributions required to be
paid to holders of Crown Senior Preferred OP Units by reason of the payment of
either the Final Crown Dividend or the Final Crown Partnership Distribution with
respect to Crown OP Units, the record date for which shall be the close of
business on the sixth business day preceding the Closing Date. The distribution
payable hereunder to holders of Crown OP Units and, if applicable, Crown Senior
Preferred OP Units, shall be paid on the third business day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

                                  (ii) If Crown determines that it will be
necessary to declare the Final Crown Dividend, Crown shall notify PREIT at least
20 days prior to the date for the Crown Shareholders Meeting, and PREIT shall be
entitled to declare a dividend per share payable to holders of shares of PREIT
Common Shares (in which event PREIT Partnership shall declare a distribution per
unit payable to holders of common units of PREIT Partnership (the "PREIT OP
Units") if a distribution has been declared on the PREIT Common Shares), the
record dates for which shall be the close of business on the fifth business day
preceding the Closing Date, in an amount per PREIT Common Share (and PREIT OP
Unit) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Final Crown Dividend
paid by Crown with respect to each Crown Common Share by (y) 0.3589 (the
"Corresponding PREIT Dividends and Distributions"). The Corresponding PREIT
Dividends and Distributions shall be in addition to any additional Corresponding
PREIT Dividends and Distributions payable pursuant to Section 5.10. Any
dividends payable hereunder to holders of PREIT Common Shares (and PREIT OP
Units) shall be paid on the second business day preceding the Closing Date.

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

                           (e) No Further Ownership Rights in Crown Common
Shares and Crown Senior Preferred Shares. All Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Section 1.11 (including any cash paid pursuant
to Section 1.11(g)) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Crown Common Shares and Crown Senior Preferred
Shares, as applicable, theretofore represented by such Certificates; provided,
however, that from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Crown of the Crown
Common Shares or Crown Senior Preferred Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to PREIT for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 1.11.

                           (f) No Liability. None of Crown, PREIT or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration or dividends delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement that
remains unclaimed for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be redelivered by
the Exchange Agent to PREIT, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who
have not theretofore complied with Section 1.11(c) shall thereafter look only to
PREIT for delivery of the Merger Consideration, including any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.11(g) and any unpaid dividends,
subject to applicable escheat and other similar laws.

                           (g) No Fractional Shares.

                                  (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Crown Common Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote, to receive dividends or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Crown.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

                                  (ii) No fractional PREIT Common Shares shall
be issued pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional
PREIT Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement, each holder of Crown Common
Shares shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the
nearest cent (with .5 of a cent rounded up), determined by multiplying (i) the
average closing price of one PREIT Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange
on the five trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the
fraction of a PREIT Common Share which such holder would otherwise be entitled
to receive under this Section 1.11.

                           (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by PREIT or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as PREIT or the Exchange Agent reasonably may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the PREIT Common Shares or PREIT Senior Preferred Shares
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8 and any cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.11(g) to which the holders thereof are entitled
and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 1.11(d).

                                    ARTICLE 2
          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CROWN AND CROWN PARTNERSHIP

                  Except as specifically set forth in the letter of even date
herewith delivered to PREIT prior to the execution hereof and signed by each of
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in such capacity, of
Crown as the disclosure letter to this Agreement (the "Crown Disclosure
Letter"), Crown and Crown Partnership jointly and severally represent and
warrant to PREIT and PREIT Partnership as follows as of the date hereof:

                  2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Crown is a real estate
investment trust duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Maryland. Crown has all requisite power and authority to own, operate,
lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now being
conducted. The Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of Crown (the
"Crown Declaration of Trust") is in effect, and no dissolution, revocation or
forfeiture proceedings regarding Crown have been commenced. Crown is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other
than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Crown Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, a "Crown Material
Adverse Effect" means any circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

is materially adverse to the business, properties, assets (tangible or
intangible), financial condition or results of operations of Crown, Crown
Partnership and the Crown Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except, in each case,
as a result of (i) changes in general economic conditions nationally or
regionally, (ii) changes affecting the real estate industry generally which do
not affect Crown or Crown Partnership, as the case may be, materially
disproportionately relative to other participants in the real estate industry
similarly situated, or (iii) in and of itself and without the occurrence of any
other Crown Material Adverse Effect, changes in the trading prices of Crown
Common Shares or Crown Senior Preferred Shares. Crown has delivered to PREIT
complete and correct copies of each of the Crown Declaration of Trust and the
Bylaws of Crown (the "Crown Bylaws"), in each case as amended or supplemented to
the date of this Agreement.

                  2.2 Crown Subsidiaries.

                           (a) Schedule 2.2(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter
sets forth (i) each Subsidiary of Crown (the "Crown Subsidiaries"), (ii) the
ownership interest therein of Crown, (iii) if not directly or indirectly wholly
owned by Crown, the identity and ownership interest of each of the other owners
of such Crown Subsidiary, (iv) each property owned by such Crown Subsidiary, and
(v) if not wholly owned by such Crown Subsidiary, the identity and ownership
interest of each of the other owners of such property. As used in this
Agreement, "Subsidiary" of any Person means any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other legal entity of which
such Person owns (either directly or through or together with another Subsidiary
of such Person) either (i) a general partner, managing member or other similar
interest, or (ii)(A) 10% or more of the voting power of the voting capital stock
or other voting equity interests, or (B) 10% or more of the outstanding voting
capital stock or other voting equity interests of such corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture or other legal entity. As used herein,
"Person" means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other
entity.

                           (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.2(b) to the
Crown Disclosure Letter, (i) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock in
each Crown Subsidiary that is a corporation which are owned by Crown, a Crown
Subsidiary or by Crown and a Crown Subsidiary have been duly authorized, validly
issued and are (A) fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive or
similar rights and (B) owned free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens") and (ii) all equity interests in each Crown Subsidiary
that is a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or trust which
are owned by Crown, a Crown Subsidiary or by Crown and a Crown Subsidiary are
owned free and clear of all Liens other than pledges, if any, contained in
organizational documents of such Crown Subsidiary and given to secure
performance thereunder. Each Crown Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its
business as now being conducted, and each Crown Subsidiary that is a

its properties and carry on its business as now being conducted. Schedule 2.2(b)

its properties requires that it be duly qualified or licensed to do business,
and other than as set forth on Schedule 2.2(b) to the Crown Disclosure Letter,
each Crown Subsidiary is in good standing in each such jurisdiction. Complete
and correct copies of the articles of incorporation, bylaws, organization
documents and partnership, joint venture and operating agreements of each Crown
Subsidiary, as amended to the date of this Agreement, have been previously
delivered or made available to PREIT.

                           (c) There are no attachments, executions or general
assignments for the benefit of creditors, or voluntary or involuntary proceeding
in bankruptcy, or under any debtor relief laws, contemplated by or pending or,
to the Knowledge of Crown, threatened against Crown or a Crown Subsidiary.

                  2.6 SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed
Liabilities. Crown Partnership is not required by any Law to file any reports,
schedules, forms, statements or other documents with the SEC and has made no
such filings. Crown has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents required to be filed in accordance with the
rules and requirements of the SEC since December 31, 1996 through the date
hereof (collectively, including all exhibits thereto and any registration
statement filed since such date, the "Crown SEC Documents"). All of the Crown
SEC Documents (other than preliminary material), as of their respective filing
dates, complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Crown SEC Documents. None of the Crown SEC
Documents at the time of filing contained, nor will any report, schedule, form,
statement or other document filed by Crown after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of Crown
included in the Crown SEC Documents complied, or will comply, as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been or will be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented, or will fairly present, in all material respects in accordance with
the applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, the consolidated financial position of Crown and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations
and cash flows for the periods then ended (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act). Except as set
forth in Schedule 2.6(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, Crown has no
Subsidiaries which are not consolidated for accounting purposes. Except for
liabilities and obligations set forth in the Crown SEC Documents or in Schedule
2.6(b) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated
balance sheet of Crown or in the notes thereto and which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Crown Material Adverse Effect.

property) with respect to the Crown Common Shares, the Crown OP Units, the Crown

Crown Common Shares, the Crown OP Units, the Crown Senior Preferred Shares, or
the Crown Senior Preferred OP Units or any issuance or the authorization of any
issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution
for, or giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise, shares of stock of
Crown or partnership interests in Crown Partnership or any issuance of an
ownership interest in, any Crown Subsidiary, except for issuances of Crown
Common Shares with respect to Crown's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (hereinafter
referred to as a "DRIP"),

                           (d) any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not

Material Adverse Effect,

practices by Crown or any of its Subsidiaries or Crown Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries materially affecting its assets, liabilities or business, except
insofar as may have been disclosed in Crown SEC Documents or required by a
change in GAAP, or

                           (f) any amendment in any material respect of any
employment, consulting, severance, retention or any other agreement between
Crown and any officer or trustee of Crown or any Affiliate or immediate family
member thereof or any new such agreement with any of the foregoing.

litigation arising from the ordinary course of operations of Crown or the Crown
Subsidiaries (a) for which insurance coverage has been acknowledged by the
applicable insurer, subject to a reasonable deductible or retention limit or (b)
for which all material costs and liabilities arising therefrom are reimbursable
pursuant to common area maintenance or similar agreements, there is no suit,
action or proceeding pending (in which service of process has been received by
an employee of Crown or a Crown Subsidiary) or, to the Knowledge of Crown,
threatened against or affecting Crown or any Crown Subsidiary that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (i) have a Crown Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent or materially impair the ability of Crown to
perform any of its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially threaten or
impair the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
court or Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Crown or any
Crown Subsidiary having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the
future would have, any such effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (y) Schedule
2.8 to the Crown Disclosure Letter sets forth each and every material uninsured
claim, equal employment opportunity claim and claim relating to sexual
harassment and/or discrimination pending or, to the Knowledge of Crown,
threatened as of the date hereof, in each case with a brief summary of such
claim or threatened claim, and (z) no claim has been made under any trustees',
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained at any time by
Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries except for those claims that have been
fully and finally adjudicated and any judgment owing on which have been fully
paid and claims for which all defendant parties have been fully and
unconditionally released and all payments under any settlement or release
agreement in connection therewith have been paid in full.

                  2.9 Properties.

                           (a) Title; Encumbrances; Property Restrictions.
Except as provided in Schedule 2.2(a) or Schedule 2.9(a) to the Crown Disclosure
Letter, Crown or the Crown Subsidiary set forth on Schedule 2.2(a) to the Crown
Disclosure Letter owns fee simple title to or holds a leasehold interest in each
of the real properties identified in Schedule 2.2(a) to the Crown Disclosure
Letter (the "Crown Properties"), which are all of the real estate properties
owned or leased by them, in each case (except for the Crown Permitted Title
Exceptions) free and clear of liens, mortgages or deeds of trust, claims against
title, charges which are liens, security interests or other encumbrances on
title ("Encumbrances"). Schedule 2.2(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter further
identifies which of the Crown Properties are owned in fee simple by Crown or the
Crown Subsidiary and which of the Crown Properties are subject to a ground lease
(the "Crown Ground Lease"). Except as set forth in Schedule 2.2(a) to the Crown
Disclosure Letter, no other Person has any ownership interest in, and any such
ownership interest so scheduled does not materially interfere with the present
use of, any of the Crown Properties subject thereto or affected thereby. Except
as set forth in Schedule 2.9(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, none of the
Crown Properties is subject to any restriction on the sale or other disposition
thereof or on the financing or release of financing thereon. The Crown
Properties are not subject to any rights of way, restrictive covenants,
agreements, laws, ordinances and regulations affecting building use or
occupancy, or reservations of an interest in title (collectively, "Property
Restrictions") or Encumbrances, except for the following (collectively, the


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

set forth in Schedule 2.9(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, (ii) Property
Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or any governmental body or authority
with respect to real property, including zoning regulations, which do not
materially adversely affect the current use of any Crown Property, (iii)
Property Restrictions and Encumbrances that are matters of public record, which
Property Restrictions and Encumbrances, in any event, do not materially
interfere with the present use of any of the Crown Properties subject thereto or
affected thereby and (iv) liens for real estate taxes not yet due and payable,
mechanics', carriers', workmen's, repairmen's liens and other Encumbrances and
Property Restrictions, if any, which, individually or in the aggregate, do not
materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with the present
use of any of the Crown Properties subject thereto or affected thereby. Schedule
2.9(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter also lists each of the Crown Properties
which are under development as of the date of this Agreement and describes the
status of such development as of the date hereof.

                           (b) Title Insurance. Except as provided in Schedule
2.9(b) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, valid policies of title insurance (or
fully paid and enforceable commitments therefor) have been issued insuring the
applicable Crown Subsidiary's (as the case may be) fee simple title or leasehold
estate, as the case may be, to the Crown Properties owned by it in amounts
approximately equal to the purchase price therefor paid by such Crown
Subsidiary, subject only to the Crown Permitted Title Exceptions and the matters
disclosed in Schedule 2.9(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter. Such policies are,
at the date hereof, in full force and effect. No material claim has been made
against any such policy.

                           (c) Permit; Violation; Condition. Except as provided
in Schedule 2.9(c) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, Crown has no Knowledge (i)
that, any certificate, permit or license from any Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over any of the Crown Properties or any agreement, easement or
other right which is necessary to permit the ownership, lawful use, operation
and licensing of the management of the buildings and improvements on any of the
Crown Properties or which is necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of
all driveways, roads, utilities and other means of egress and ingress to and
from any of the Crown Properties has not been obtained and is not in full force
and effect, or of any pending threat of modification or cancellation of any of
the same, the absence of which would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on such Crown Property, (ii) of any written notice of any
violation of any federal, state or municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation
or requirement affecting any of the Crown Properties issued by any Governmental
Entity which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

such Crown Property, (iii) of any structural defects relating to any Crown
Property which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
such Crown Property, (iv) of any Crown Property whose building systems are not
in working order so as to have a material adverse effect on such Crown Property,
(v) of any physical damage to any Crown Property in excess of $500,000 for which
there is not insurance in effect covering the cost of the restoration and the
loss of revenue (subject to a reasonable deduction or retention limit) or any
such physical damage that could reasonably give rise to a tenant's right to
terminate the Crown Space Lease applicable to such Crown Property, or (vi) of
current renovation or restoration to any Crown Properties that is underway or is
being completed, the cost of which exceeds $250,000.

                           (d) Condemnation; Zoning; Work. Except as set forth
in Schedule 2.9(d) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, neither of Crown nor any
Crown Subsidiary has received any written or published notice to the effect that
(i) any condemnation or involuntary rezoning proceedings are pending or
threatened with respect to any of the Crown Properties or (ii) any zoning,
building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will be
violated by the continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or
other improvements on any of the Crown Properties or by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas which would reasonably be
expected, with respect to both (i) and (ii), to have a material adverse effect
on such Crown Property. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9(d) to the Crown
Disclosure Letter, (i) all work required to be performed, payments required to
be made and actions required to be taken prior to the date hereof pursuant to
any agreement entered into with a governmental body or authority in connection
with a site approval, zoning reclassification or other similar action relating
to any Crown Properties (e.g., Local Improvement District, Road Improvement
District, Environmental Mitigation) have been performed, paid or taken, as the
case may be, and (ii) Crown has no Knowledge of any planned or proposed work,
payments or actions that may be required after the date hereof pursuant to such
agreements, in each of case (i) and (ii) except as set forth in development or
operating budgets for such Crown Properties delivered to PREIT and PREIT
Partnership prior to the date hereof and other than those which would not
reasonably be expected to have a Crown Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, "Environmental Mitigation" means investigation, clean-up, removal
action, remedial action, restoration, repair, response action, corrective
action, monitoring, sampling and analysis, installation, reclamation, closure or
post-closure in response to any actual or suspected environmental condition or

(or any of the rights, properties or assets thereof) is bound or (iii) with
respect to which any Crown Controlled Group Member may otherwise have any
liability (whether or not such Crown Controlled Group Member still maintains
such Crown Employee Plan). Each Crown Employee Plan is listed on Schedule 2.12
to the Crown Disclosure Letter. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.12 to the
Crown Disclosure Letter, with respect to the Crown Employee Plans:

                           (a) No Crown Controlled Group Member has any
continuing liability, including any post-retirement medical, dental, life
insurance or other benefits, under any Welfare Plan which provides for
continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any dependent or
beneficiary of a participant after such participant's termination of employment,
except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 (et seq.)
of ERISA ("COBRA"), or under any applicable state law, the cost of which is
fully paid by the participant or the dependent or beneficiary of the
participant. Schedule 2.12(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of (i) each former employee of Crown Partnership who
is entitled to benefits under COBRA as of the date of this Agreement and (ii)
the Welfare Plan under which such benefits are to be provided.

                           (b) Each Crown Employee Plan complies in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and any other applicable laws governing such Crown
Employee Plan, and each Crown Employee Plan has at all times been properly
administered in all material respects in accordance with all such requirements
of the law and all regulations issued thereunder, and in accordance with its
terms and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement to the
extent consistent with all such requirements of law. Each Pension Plan is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and each trust established by each
Pension Plan is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code.
Each Pension Plan is, and from its establishment has been, the subject of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS stating that such Pension Plan meets
the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust associated
with such Pension Plan is tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. No event
has occurred since the date of each Pension Plan's last determination letter
that would jeopardize the qualified status of any such plan or the tax exempt
status of any such trust under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code,
respectively. No lawsuits, claims (other than routine claims for benefits) or
complaints to, or by, any Person, governmental entity, regulatory body or
arbiter have been filed, are pending or are threatened with respect to any Crown
Employee Plan and there is no fact or contemplated event that would give rise to
any such lawsuit, claim (other than routine claims for benefits) or complaint
with respect to any Crown Employee Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, the
following are true with respect to each Crown Employee Plan:

                  (i)      all Crown Controlled Group Members have complied in
                           all material respects with the reporting and
                           disclosure requirements of both ERISA and the Code
                           with respect to each Crown Employee Plan and no Crown
                           Controlled Group Member has incurred any liability in
                           connection with such reporting or disclosure
                           requirements or has knowledge of any facts or
                           contemplated events that would be expected to give
                           rise to any liability in connection with such
                           reporting or disclosure requirements;

                           Crown Employee Plans that are required to be made by
                           a Crown Controlled Group Member with respect to
                           periods ending on or before the Closing Date have
                           been, or will be, made or accrued before the Closing

                           document, actuarial report, collective bargaining
                           agreements, insurance contracts or arrangements, or
                           as otherwise required by either ERISA or the Code and
                           no Crown Controlled Group Member shall take any
                           actions relating to the Crown Employee Plans that
                           will increase PREIT's or PREIT Partnership's
                           obligations under the Crown Employee Plans after the
                           Closing Date;

                  (iii)    with respect to each Crown Employee Plan, to the

                           available to PREIT true and complete copies of (A)

                           to any request for and receipt of any such rulings,

<PAGE>

foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns or reports or failure to

reasonably be expected to have a Crown Material Adverse Effect; (ii) to the
Knowledge of Crown, no claim has ever been made by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where Crown or the Crown Subsidiaries do not file a Tax return that
Crown or any Crown Subsidiary may be the subject of Taxation in that
jurisdiction; (iii) the most recent audited financial statements contained in

thereof through the date of such financial statements; (iv) since the Crown

Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the
Code or any Tax arising or resulting from redetermined rents, redetermined

condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed upon Crown or
any Crown Subsidiary; (vi) neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary is the subject

penalties or additional amounts attributable to, or imposed upon, or with
respect to any such taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments.

                           (b) Crown (i) for all taxable years for which the IRS
could assert a Tax liability, has been subject to taxation as a real estate
investment trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and
has qualified as a REIT for all such years, (ii) has operated since December 31,
2002 to the date of this representation, and intends to continue to operate, in
such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the earlier
of December 31, 2003 or the Effective Time and, if later, for the taxable year
ending on the Effective Time, and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any
action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge to its status
as a REIT and, to Crown's Knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened.
Each Crown Subsidiary that is a partnership, business, trust, joint venture or
limited liability company either (A) (i) has been treated since its formation
and continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes either as a
partnership or as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes
and not as a corporation or as an association taxable as a corporation and (ii)
has not since the later of its formation or the acquisition by Crown of a direct
or indirect interest therein, owned any assets (including, without limitation,
securities) that would cause Crown to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code or
(B) has been treated since its formation and continues to be treated for federal
income tax purposes as a corporation that qualifies as (x) a REIT within the
meaning of Section 856 of the Code, (y) a qualified REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(i) of the Code, or (z) a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section
856(l) of the Code. Crown Partnership is not a publicly traded partnership
within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is taxable as a
corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code. For all tax years in which
the IRS could assert a tax liability, each such corporation and each other
issuer in which Crown holds or has held securities (within the meaning of
Section 856(c) of the Code but excluding "straight debt" of issuers described in
Section 856(c)(7)) having a value of more than 10% of the total value of the
outstanding securities of such issuer has qualified at all times as either a
REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code, a qualified REIT subsidiary
under Section 856(i) of the Code, or a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section
856(l) of the Code. Neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary holds any asset (x)
the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of
the Code as a result of IRS Notice 88-19, Temporary Treas. Regs. ss.1.337(d)-5T,
ss.1.337(d)-6T or ss.1.337(d)-7T, or (y) which is subject to a consent filed
pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

                           (c) To Crown's Knowledge, as of the date hereof,
Crown is a "domestically-controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section
897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.

                           (d) There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of
Crown or the Crown Subsidiaries, other than liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable.

                           (e) Neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary is party
to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement.

                           (f) Crown does not have any liability for the Taxes
of any person other than Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries, and the Crown
Subsidiaries do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than
Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries (A) under Treas. Reg.ss.1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (B) as transferee or
successor, (C) by contract, or (D) otherwise.

                           (g) Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries have not taken
any positions on any of their federal income Tax returns which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to a substantial underpayment of Tax under Section 6662
of the Code.

                           (h) Neither Crown nor any of the Crown Subsidiaries
will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of
deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending after the Effective Time as a result of any: (A) change in method of
accounting for taxable period ending on or prior to the Effective Time under
Code Section 481(c) (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local
or foreign income Tax law); (B) "closing agreement" as described in Code Section
7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Effective Time; (C) installment sale
or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Effective Time; or (D)
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Effective Time.

                           (i) Neither Crown Partnership nor any Crown
Subsidiary that is a partnership for federal income tax purposes has made, with
regard to any taxable year since its formation (including, without limitation,
its taxable year ended December 31, 2002 and any short taxable year ending at
the Effective Time), an election under Section 754 of the Code.

                  2.15 No Payments to Employees, Officers or Trustees. Schedule
2.15 to the Crown Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of all
arrangements, agreements or plans pursuant to which cash and non-cash payments
are or will become payable to each employee, officer, director or trustee of
Crown or any Crown Subsidiary as a result of the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or a termination of service subsequent to the
consummation of the Merger. Except as described in Schedule 2.15 to the Crown
Disclosure Letter, or as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, there is no
employment or severance contract, or other agreement requiring payments,
cancellation of indebtedness or other obligation to be made on a change of
control or otherwise as a result of the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of a termination of service
subsequent to the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, with respect to any employee, officer, director or trustee of Crown
or any Crown Subsidiary. Except as described in Schedule 2.15 to the Crown
Disclosure Letter, there is no agreement or arrangement with any employee,
officer or other service provider under which Crown or any Crown Subsidiary has
agreed to pay any tax that might be owed under Section 4999 of the Code with
respect to payments to such individuals.

                  2.16 Broker; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Wachovia
Securities, the fees and expenses of which are described in that certain

advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions

                  2.17 Compliance with Laws. Neither Crown nor any Crown
Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity or award
to any arbitration applicable to its business, properties or operations, except
in each case to the extent that such violation or failure would not reasonably
be expected to have a Crown Material Adverse Effect.

                  2.18 Contracts; Debt Instruments.

                           (a) Default. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.18(a)

received a written notice in 2002 or 2003 that it is in violation of or in
default under any lease to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets is bound or (ii) has received a written notice that it is
in violation of or in default under (or that there exists any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would reasonably be
expected to cause such a violation of or default under) any (A) loan or credit

                           (d) Prepayment Restrictions. Except as set forth in
Schedule 2.18(d) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, neither Crown nor any Crown

                           (f) Property Related Agreements. Except as set forth
in Schedule 2.18(f) to the Crown Disclosure Letter or as otherwise disclosed in
Section 2.5 and this Section 2.18, neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary has

agreement, equipment lease, or other agreements with a third-party relating to
operations at the Crown Properties, other than those that involve total payment
by Crown or Crown Subsidiary of no more than $100,000 per annum and are
terminable by Crown or a Crown Subsidiary without penalty upon (i) one (1) year
prior written notice or less or (ii) ninety (90) days' prior written notice upon

hand, nor, to the Knowledge of Crown or Crown Partnership, any other party, on
the other hand, is in default under any of the agreements set forth in Schedule
2.18(f) to the Crown Disclosure Letter.

                           (g) Budget. Crown has delivered to PREIT prior to the
date of this Agreement a true and complete capital budget for the year 2003
relating to budgeted capital improvements and development. Schedule 2.18(g) to
the Crown Disclosure Letter lists all material agreements entered into by Crown
and Crown Subsidiaries relating to the development or construction of, or
additions or expansions to, any Crown Real Properties (or any properties with
respect to which Crown has executed as of the date of this Agreement a purchase

which Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries currently has, or expects to incur,
an obligation in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate in the future. True,

                           (j) Tax Protection Agreements. Except as set forth in
Schedule 2.18(j) to the Crown Disclosure Letter, neither Crown nor any Crown
Subsidiary has entered into or is subject, directly or indirectly, to any Crown
Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, a "Crown Tax Protection Agreement" is
an agreement, oral or written, (A) that has as one of its purposes to permit a
Person to take the position that such Person could defer federal taxable income
that otherwise might have been recognized upon a transfer of property to the
Crown Partnership or any other Crown Subsidiary that is treated as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes, and that (i) prohibits or restricts in any
manner the disposition of any assets of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary, (ii)
requires that Crown or any Crown Subsidiary maintain, put in place, or replace,
indebtedness, whether or not secured by one or more of the Crown Properties, or
(iii) requires that Crown or any Crown Subsidiary offer to any Person at any
time the opportunity to guarantee or otherwise assume, directly or indirectly
(including, without limitation, through a "deficit restoration obligation,"
guarantee (including, without limitation, a "bottom" guarantee), indemnification
agreement or other similar arrangement), the risk of loss for federal income tax
purposes for indebtedness or other liabilities of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary,
(B) that specifies or relates to a method of taking into account book-tax
disparities under Section 704(c) of the Code with respect to one or more assets
of Crown or a Crown Subsidiary, or (C) that requires a particular method for
allocating one or more liabilities of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary under
Section 752 of the Code. Neither Crown nor any Crown Subsidiary is in violation
of or in default under any Crown Tax Protection Agreement.

                  2.19 Opinions of Financial Advisor. Crown has received the
written opinion of Wachovia Securities, Crown's financial advisor, to the effect
that the consideration to be received by the holders of Crown Common Shares
pursuant to the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point of view.

                  2.20 State Takeover Statutes. Crown has taken all action
necessary to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement between
PREIT and Crown and its Affiliates from the operation of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or any other anti-takeover statute or
similar statute enacted under the laws of the state or federal laws of the
United States or similar statute or regulation (a "Takeover Statute").

                  2.21 Rights Agreement. The Board of Trustees of Crown has
resolved, and Crown has taken all action necessary, to render the rights (the
"Crown Rights") issued pursuant to the terms of that certain Rights Agreement,
dated as of January 20, 2000, between Crown and American Stock Transfers and
Trust Company, as rights agent (the "Crown Rights Agreement"), inapplicable to
(i) the execution of this Agreement and the Merger Documents (ii) the Merger and
(iii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Documents.
The Crown Rights Agreement has been amended so that (a) PREIT and each of its
Subsidiaries is exempt from the definition of "Acquiring Person" (as defined in
the Crown Rights Agreement), (b) no "Share Acquisition Date," "Distribution
Date," or "Flip-Over Entity" (as such terms are defined in the Crown Rights
Agreement) will occur as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement and (c)
the Crown Rights Agreement will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time.
The Crown Rights Agreement, as amended in accordance with the preceding
sentence, has not been further amended or modified. Copies of all existing
amendments to the Crown Rights Agreement have been previously provided to PREIT.

necessary or required under this Agreement or under applicable law to approve
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Merger, or the

                  2.25 Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in Schedule
2.25 to the Crown Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of Crown, neither Crown
nor any Crown Subsidiary is infringing upon any intellectual property rights of
any other Person nor, to the Knowledge of Crown, is any other Person infringing
on any of Crown or Crown Subsidiaries' rights in respect of the intellectual
property owned and used by any of such entities.

                  2.26 Documents. Crown and Crown Partnership have made
available to PREIT true, correct and complete copies of all documents referenced

          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PREIT AND PREIT PARTNERSHIP

                  Except as specifically set forth in the letter of even date
herewith delivered to Crown prior to the execution hereof and signed by each of
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in such capacity, of
PREIT as the disclosure letter to this Agreement (the "PREIT Disclosure
Letter"), PREIT and PREIT Partnership jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Crown and Crown Partnership as follows as of the date hereof:

                  3.1 Organization, Standing and Power. PREIT is a business
trust duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
Pennsylvania. PREIT has all requisite power and authority to own, operate, lease
and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now being conducted.
The PREIT Trust Agreement is in effect, and no dissolution, revocation or
forfeiture proceedings regarding PREIT have been commenced. PREIT is duly
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other
than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
PREIT Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, a "PREIT Material
Adverse Effect" means any circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that
is materially adverse to the business, properties, assets (tangible or
intangible), financial condition or results of operations of PREIT, PREIT
Partnership and the PREIT Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except, in each case,
as a result of (i) changes in general economic conditions nationally or
regionally, (ii) changes affecting the real estate industry generally which do
not affect PREIT or PREIT Partnership, as the case may be, materially
disproportionately relative to other participants in the real estate industry
similarly situated, or (iii) in and of itself and without the occurrence of any
other PREIT Material Adverse Effect, changes in the trading prices of PREIT
Common Shares. PREIT has delivered to Crown complete and correct copies of each
of the PREIT Trust Agreement and the PREIT Bylaws, in each case as amended or
supplemented to the date of this Agreement.

                  3.2 PREIT Subsidiaries.

                           (a) Schedule 3.2(a) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter
sets forth (i) each Subsidiary of PREIT (the "PREIT Subsidiaries"), (ii) the
ownership interest therein of PREIT, (iii) if not directly or indirectly wholly
owned by PREIT, the identity and ownership interest of each of the other owners
of such PREIT Subsidiary, (iv) each property owned by such PREIT Subsidiary, and
(v) if not wholly owned by such PREIT Subsidiary, the identity and ownership
interest of each of the other owners of such property.

each PREIT Subsidiary that is a corporation which are owned by PREIT, a PREIT
Subsidiary or by PREIT and a PREIT Subsidiary have been duly authorized, validly

similar rights and (B) owned free and clear of all Liens and (ii) all equity
interests in each PREIT Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company or trust which are owned by PREIT, a PREIT Subsidiary or by
PREIT and a PREIT Subsidiary are owned free and clear of all Liens other than
pledges, if any, contained in organizational documents of such PREIT Subsidiary
and given to secure performance thereunder. Each PREIT Subsidiary that is a
corporation is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry
on its business as now being conducted, and each PREIT Subsidiary that is a
partnership, limited liability company or trust is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization
and has the requisite power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber
its properties and carry on its business as now being conducted. Each PREIT
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary.
Complete and correct copies of the articles of incorporation, bylaws,
organization documents and partnership, joint venture and operating agreements
of each PREIT Subsidiary, as amended to the date of this Agreement, have been
previously delivered or made available to Crown.

                           (c) There are no attachments, executions or general
assignments for the benefit of creditors, or voluntary or involuntary proceeding
in bankruptcy, or under any debtor relief laws, contemplated by or pending or,
to the Knowledge of PREIT, threatened against PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary.

or other rights to acquire PREIT's shares of beneficial interest, all stock

                           (f) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3(f) to the
PREIT Disclosure Letter, all dividends on PREIT Common Shares and all

Partnership or any PREIT Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any interest or

Other Interests, PREIT and/or any PREIT Subsidiary, as the case may be, is a
partner, member or shareholder in good standing, and owns such interests free
and clear of all Liens. None of PREIT, PREIT Partnership or any PREIT Subsidiary

                  3.6 SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed
Liabilities. PREIT Partnership is not required by any Law to file any reports,
schedules, forms, statements or other documents with the SEC and has made no
such filings. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6(a) to the PREIT Disclosure
Letter, PREIT has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents required to be filed in accordance with the
rules and requirements of the SEC since December 31, 1996 through the date
hereof (collectively, including all exhibits thereto and any registration
statement filed since such date, the "PREIT SEC Documents"). All of the PREIT
SEC Documents (other than preliminary material), as of their respective filing
dates, complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to such PREIT SEC Documents. None of the PREIT
SEC Documents at the time of filing contained, nor will any report, schedule,
form, statement or other document filed by PREIT after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of PREIT
included in the PREIT SEC Documents complied, or will comply, as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been or will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and fairly presented, or will fairly present, in all material
respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the consolidated financial position
of PREIT and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under
the Exchange Act). Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6(b) to the PREIT
Disclosure Letter, PREIT has no Subsidiaries which are not consolidated for
accounting purposes. Except for liabilities and obligations set forth in the
PREIT SEC Documents or in Schedule 3.6(c) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter,
neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to
be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of PREIT or in the notes thereto
and which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect.

                  3.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed
in the PREIT SEC Documents or in Schedule 3.7 to the PREIT Disclosure Letter or
as provided herein, since December 31, 2002 (the "PREIT Financial Statement

effect that has had a PREIT Material Adverse Effect, nor has there been any
circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that with the passage of time
would reasonably be expected to result in a PREIT Material Adverse Effect,

                           (b) any authorization, declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or
property) with respect to the PREIT Common Shares or PREIT OP Units, except for
regular quarterly distributions not in excess of (i) $.54 per PREIT Common Share
or PREIT OP Unit (subject to any Corresponding PREIT Dividends paid pursuant to
Section 1.11(d)(ii)), or (ii) with respect to the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the Closing Date, distributions as necessary to maintain
REIT status, in each case with customary record and payment dates,

                           (c) any split, combination or reclassification of the
PREIT Common Shares or the PREIT OP Units or any issuance or the authorization
of any issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
substitution for, or giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise, shares
of stock of PREIT or partnership interests in PREIT Partnership or any issuance
of an ownership interest in, any PREIT Partnership, except for issuances of
PREIT Common Shares with respect to PREIT's DRIP and PREIT's Employee Share
Purchase Plans,

                           (d) any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not
covered by insurance, that has or would reasonably be expected to have a PREIT
Material Adverse Effect,

                           (e) any change in accounting methods, principles or

liabilities or business, except insofar as may have been disclosed in the PREIT
SEC Documents or required by a change in GAAP, or

                           (f) except as set forth in Schedule 3.7(f) to the
PREIT Disclosure Letter, any amendment in any material respect of any
employment, consulting, severance, retention or any other agreement between
PREIT and any officer or trustee of PREIT or any Affiliate or immediate family
member thereof or any new such agreement with any of the foregoing.

                  3.8 Litigation. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.8 to the
PREIT Disclosure Letter or in the PREIT SEC Documents filed with the SEC after
December 31, 2002, and other than personal injury and other routine tort
litigation arising from the ordinary course of operations of PREIT or the PREIT
Subsidiaries (a) for which insurance coverage has been acknowledged by the
applicable insurer, subject to a reasonable deductible or retention limit or (b)
for which all material costs and liabilities arising therefrom are reimbursable
pursuant to common area maintenance or similar agreements, there is no suit,
action or proceeding pending (in which service of process has been received by
an employee of PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary) or, to the Knowledge of PREIT,
threatened against or affecting PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary that, individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to (i) have a PREIT Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent or materially impair the ability of PREIT to
perform any of its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially threaten or
impair the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
court or Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against PREIT or any
PREIT Subsidiary having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the
future would have, any such effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (y) Schedule
3.8 to the PREIT Disclosure Letter sets forth each and every material uninsured
claim, equal employment opportunity claim and claim relating to sexual
harassment and/or discrimination pending or, to the Knowledge of PREIT,
threatened as of the date hereof, in each case with a brief summary of such
claim or threatened claim, and (z) no claim has been made under any trustees',
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained at any time by
PREIT or any of the PREIT Subsidiaries except for those claims that have been
fully and finally adjudicated and any judgment owing on which have been fully
paid and claims for which all defendant parties have been fully and
unconditionally released and all payments under any settlement or release
agreement in connection therewith have been paid in full.

                  3.9 Properties.

                           (a) Title; Encumbrances; Property Restrictions.
Except as provided in Schedule 3.2(a) or Schedule 3.9(a) to the PREIT Disclosure
Letter, PREIT or the PREIT Subsidiary set forth on Schedule 3.2(a) to the PREIT
Disclosure Letter owns fee simple title to or holds a leasehold interest in each
of the real properties identified in Schedule 3.2(a) to the PREIT Disclosure
Letter (the "PREIT Properties"), which are all of the real estate properties
owned or leased by them, in each case (except for the PREIT Permitted Title
Exceptions) free and clear of Encumbrances. Schedule 3.2(a) to the PREIT
Disclosure Letter further identifies which of the PREIT Properties are owned in
fee simple by PREIT or the PREIT Subsidiary and which of the PREIT Properties
are subject to a ground lease (the "PREIT Ground Lease"). Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.2(a) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, no other Person has any
ownership interest in, and any such ownership interest so scheduled does not
materially interfere with the present use of, any of the PREIT Properties
subject thereto or affected thereby. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9(a) to
the PREIT Disclosure Letter, none of the PREIT Properties is subject to any
restriction on the sale or other disposition thereof or on the financing or
release of financing thereon. The PREIT Properties are not subject to any
Property Restrictions or Encumbrances, except for the following (collectively,
the "PREIT Permitted Title Exceptions"): (i) Property Restrictions and
Encumbrances set forth in Schedule 3.9(a) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, (ii)
Property Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or any governmental body or
authority with respect to real property, including zoning regulations, which do
not materially adversely affect the current use of any PREIT Property, (iii)
Property Restrictions and Encumbrances that are matters of public record, which
Property Restrictions and Encumbrances, in any event, do not materially
interfere with the present use of any of the PREIT Properties subject thereto or
affected thereby and (iv) liens for real estate taxes not yet due and payable,
mechanics', carriers', workmen's, repairmen's liens and other Encumbrances and
Property Restrictions, if any, which, individually or in the aggregate, do not
materially detract from the value of or materially interfere with the present
use of any of the PREIT Properties subject thereto or affected thereby. Schedule
3.9(a) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter also lists each of the PREIT Properties
which are under development as of the date of this Agreement and describes the
status of such development as of the date hereof.

<PAGE>

                           (b) Title Insurance. Except as provided in Schedule
3.9(b) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, valid policies of title insurance (or
fully paid and enforceable commitments therefor) have been issued insuring the
applicable PREIT Subsidiary's (as the case may be) fee simple title or leasehold
estate, as the case may be, to the PREIT Properties owned by it in amounts
approximately equal to the purchase price therefor paid by such PREIT
Subsidiary, subject only to the PREIT Permitted Title Exceptions and the matters
disclosed in Schedule 3.9(a) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter. Such policies are,
at the date hereof, in full force and effect. No material claim has been made
against any such policy.

                           (c) Permit; Violation; Condition. Except as provided
in Schedule 3.9(c) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, PREIT has no Knowledge (i)
that, any certificate, permit or license from any Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over any of the PREIT Properties or any agreement, easement or
other right which is necessary to permit the ownership, lawful use, operation
and licensing of the management of the buildings and improvements on any of the
PREIT Properties or which is necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of
all driveways, roads, utilities and other means of egress and ingress to and
from any of the PREIT Properties has not been obtained and is not in full force
and effect, or of any pending threat of modification or cancellation of any of
the same, the absence of which would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on such PREIT Property, (ii) of any written notice of any
violation of any federal, state or municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation
or requirement affecting any of the PREIT Properties issued by any Governmental
Entity which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
such PREIT Property, (iii) of any structural defects relating to any PREIT
Property which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
such PREIT Property, (iv) of any PREIT Property whose building systems are not
in working order so as to have a material adverse effect on such PREIT Property,
(v) of any physical damage to any PREIT Property in excess of $500,000 for which
there is not insurance in effect covering the cost of the restoration and the
loss of revenue (subject to a reasonable deduction or retention limit) or any
such physical damage that could reasonably give rise to a tenant's right to
terminate the PREIT Space Lease applicable to such PREIT Property, or (vi) of
current renovation or restoration to any PREIT Properties that is underway or is
being completed, the cost of which exceeds $250,000.

                           (d) Condemnation; Zoning; Work. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.9(d) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, neither of PREIT nor any
PREIT Subsidiary has received any written or published notice to the effect that
(i) any condemnation or involuntary rezoning proceedings are pending or
threatened with respect to any of the PREIT Properties or (ii) any zoning,
building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will be
violated by the continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or
other improvements on any of the PREIT Properties or by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas which would reasonably be
expected, with respect to both (i) and (ii), to have a material adverse effect
on such PREIT Property. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9(d) to the PREIT
Disclosure Letter, (i) all work required to be performed, payments required to
be made and actions required to be taken prior to the date hereof pursuant to
any agreement entered into with a governmental body or authority in connection
with a site approval, zoning reclassification or other similar action relating
to any PREIT Properties (e.g., Local Improvement District, Road Improvement
District, Environmental Mitigation) have been performed, paid or taken, as the
case may be, and (ii) PREIT has no Knowledge of any planned or proposed work,
payments or actions that may be required after the date hereof pursuant to such
agreements, in each of case (i) and (ii) other than those which would not
reasonably be expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect.

Tenants, and the Other Tenants identified therein (together, the "PREIT Rent
Roll") lists each PREIT Space Lease in effect as of the respective dates
indicated in the PREIT Rent Roll and, except for omissions or discrepancies
that, individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect, all information set forth in the PREIT
Rent Roll is true, correct and complete as of the date thereof. "PREIT Space
Lease" means each lease or other right of occupancy affecting or relating to a
property in which PREIT (or an entity in which it directly or indirectly has an
interest) is the landlord, either pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement
or as successor to any prior landlord, but excluding any PREIT Ground Lease and
agreements for space with a non-renewable term of less than one year. PREIT has
made available to Crown true, correct and complete copies of all PREIT Space
Leases, including all amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals,
extensions and guarantees related thereto, as of the date hereof. Except as set
forth in a delinquency report, dated as of May 2, 2003 and previously provided
by PREIT to Crown, neither PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary, on the one hand, nor,
to the Knowledge of PREIT or PREIT Partnership, any other party, on the other
hand, is in default under any PREIT Space Lease, except for such defaults that
would not reasonably be expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect.

reciprocal operating or easement agreements (the "PREIT Reciprocal Operating
Agreements") encumbering and or benefiting any PREIT Properties in effect as of
the dates set forth therein. PREIT has made available to Crown true, correct and

related thereto, as of the date hereof. Neither PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary,
on the one hand, nor, to the Knowledge of PREIT or PREIT Partnership, any other
party, on the other hand, is in default under any PREIT Reciprocal Operating
Agreement, except for such defaults that would not reasonably be expected to
have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect.

                           (g) Ground Lease. None of PREIT, PREIT Partnership or
any PREIT Subsidiary, as applicable, on the one hand, or, to the Knowledge of
PREIT or PREIT Partnership, another party, on the other hand, is in default
under any PREIT Ground Lease, except for such defaults that would not reasonably
be expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect.

                           (h) Insurance. Schedule 3.9(h) to the PREIT
Disclosure letter contains a true and complete list as of the date hereof, by
type of insurance, carrier, coverages (including limits) and term, of all
material policies of casualty, liability and other types of insurance (except
title insurance) carried by PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary. All such policies are
in full force and effect and neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary has received
from any insurance company notice of any material defects or deficiencies
affecting the insurability of PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary or any of their
respective assets thereunder.

                  3.10 Environmental Matters.

                           (a) Except as disclosed in the PREIT SEC Documents,

                                  (i) neither PREIT nor any of the PREIT
Subsidiaries or, to PREIT's Knowledge, any other Person has caused or permitted
the presence of any Hazardous Materials at, on or under any of the PREIT
Properties, and neither PREIT nor any of the PREIT Subsidiaries has any
Knowledge of the presence of any Hazardous Materials at, on or under any of the
PREIT Properties, in each of the foregoing cases, such that the presence of such
Hazardous Materials (including the presence of asbestos in any buildings or
improvements at the PREIT Properties) would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect;

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

                                  (ii) except in accordance with the
Environmental Permits, there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at,

owned, operated or leased by PREIT or the PREIT Subsidiaries (the "Former PREIT
Properties") during the period of such ownership, operation or tenancy in
violation of any applicable Environmental Law and which have not been remediated
in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits,
which Releases would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect;

                                  (iii) (y) PREIT and the PREIT Subsidiaries
have not failed to comply in any material respect with any Environmental Laws,
and (z) neither PREIT nor any of the PREIT Subsidiaries has any liability under
the Environmental Laws, except in each of cases (y) and (z) to the extent that
any such failure to comply or any such liability, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse
Effect;

                                  (iv) PREIT and the PREIT Subsidiaries have
been duly issued, and currently have and will maintain through the Closing Date,
all Environmental Permits except where the failure to obtain and maintain such
Environmental Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect. PREIT and the PREIT
Subsidiaries have filed applications for all Environmental Permits necessary to
operate their businesses as currently operated; and

                                  (v) except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(b)(v)
to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of PREIT, no mining of coal or
"other minerals", or "surface coal mining operations" or similar activities with
respect to "other minerals", as those terms are defined by the Federal Surface
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, as amended, 30 U.S.C. Section 1201
et seq., have occurred or are occurring at any of the PREIT Properties.

                           (b) PREIT has previously delivered or made available
to Crown complete copies of all material documents and reports, including,
without limitation, environmental investigations and testing or analysis that

                  3.12 Employee Benefits.

                           (a) As used herein, the term "PREIT Employee Plan"
includes any pension, retirement, savings, disability, medical, dental, health,
life, death benefit, group insurance, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
stock option, equity compensation, bonus, incentive, vacation pay, tuition
reimbursement, severance pay, employment continuation, change of control, fringe
benefit or other employee benefit plan, trust, agreement, contract, policy or
commitment (including, without limitation, any Pension Plan), and any Welfare
Plan), whether any of the foregoing is funded, insured or self-funded, written
or oral, sponsored or maintained by PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary (each, a
"PREIT Controlled Group Member" for purposes of this Section 3.12). Each PREIT
Employee Plan complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any other
applicable laws governing such PREIT Employee Plan, and each PREIT Employee Plan
has at all times been properly administered in all material respects in
accordance with all such requirements of the law and all regulations issued
thereunder, and in accordance with its terms and the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining agreement to the extent consistent with all such
requirements of law. Each Pension Plan sponsored or maintained by PREIT or any
PREIT Controlled Group member is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and
each trust established by each Pension Plan is exempt from federal income tax
under Section 501(a) of the Code. Each Pension Plan is, and from its
establishment has been, the subject of a favorable determination letter from the
IRS stating that such Pension Plan meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of
the Code and that the trust associated with such Pension Plan is tax-exempt
under Section 501(a) of the Code. No event has occurred since the date of each
Pension Plan's last determination letter that would jeopardize the qualified
status of any such plan or the tax exempt status of any such trust under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively. No lawsuits, claims (other
than routine claims for benefits) or complaints to, or by, any Person,
governmental entity, regulatory body or arbiter have been filed, are pending or
are threatened with respect to any PREIT Employee Plan and there is no fact or
contemplated event that would give rise to any such lawsuit, claim (other than
routine claims for benefits) or complaint with respect to any PREIT Employee
Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, the following are true with respect to
each PREIT Employee Plan:

                  (i) all PREIT Controlled Group Members have complied in all
                  material respects with the reporting and disclosure
                  requirements of both ERISA and the Code with respect to each
                  PREIT Employee Plan and no PREIT Controlled Group Member has
                  incurred any liability in connection with such reporting or
                  disclosure requirements or has knowledge of any facts or
                  contemplated events that would be expected to give rise to any
                  liability in connection with such reporting or disclosure
                  requirements;

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

                  (ii) all contributions and payments with respect to the PREIT
                  Employee Plans that are required to be made by a PREIT
                  Controlled Group Member with respect to periods ending on or
                  before the Closing Date (including periods from the first day
                  of the current plan or policy year to the Closing Date) have
                  been, or will be, made or accrued before the Closing Date in
                  accordance with the appropriate plan document, actuarial
                  report, collective bargaining agreements, insurance contracts
                  or arrangements, or as otherwise required by either ERISA or
                  the Code;

                  (iii) with respect to each PREIT Employee Plan, to the extent
                  applicable, PREIT has delivered to or has made available to
                  Crown true and complete copies of (A) all plan documents, or
                  any and all other documents that establish the existence of
                  the plan, trust, arrangement, contract, policy or commitment

                  3.14 Taxes.

                           (a) Each of PREIT and the PREIT Subsidiaries (A) has
filed all Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving
effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having
authority to do so), and all such returns and reports are accurate and complete
in all respects, (B) has paid (or PREIT has paid on its behalf) all Taxes owed
by it (whether or not shown on such returns and reports), and (C) has complied
in all respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the
payment and withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation, withholding of
Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121, and 3402 of the Code)
and has, within the time period prescribed by law, withheld and paid over to the
proper Governmental Entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid
over under applicable laws and regulations, except, with respect to all of the
foregoing, where the failure to file such tax returns or reports or failure to
pay such Taxes or failure to comply with such withholding requirements would not
reasonably be expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge
of PREIT, no claim has ever been made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction
where PREIT or the PREIT Subsidiaries do not file a Tax return that PREIT or any
PREIT Subsidiary may be the subject of Taxation in that jurisdiction. The most
recent audited financial statements contained in the PREIT SEC Documents reflect
an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by PREIT and the PREIT
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements. Since the PREIT Financial Statement Date, PREIT has
incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the
Code, including without limitation any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction
described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code or any Tax arising or resulting from
redetermined rents, redetermined deductions or excess interest described in
Section 857(b)(7) of the Code, and neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary has
incurred any liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business.
No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a
material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be
imposed upon PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary. Neither PREIT nor any PREIT
Subsidiary is the subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in
respect of federal income Taxes, and to PREIT's Knowledge, no audit, examination
or other proceeding in respect of federal income Taxes involving any of PREIT or
any PREIT Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority and, except for
audits completed prior to December 31, 1997, no audit, examination, or other
proceeding in respect of federal income taxes involving PREIT or any PREIT
Subsidiary has occurred. To the Knowledge of PREIT, there are no pending
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against
PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess
any such Taxes have been granted or are pending.

                           (b) PREIT (i) for all taxable years for which the IRS
could assert a Tax liability, has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the
meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has qualified as a REIT for all such
years, (ii) has operated since December 31, 2002 to the date of this
representation, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to
qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the earlier of December 31,
2003 and, if later, for the taxable year that includes the Effective Time, and
(iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be
expected to result in a challenge to its status as a REIT and, to PREIT's
Knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened. Each PREIT Subsidiary
that is a partnership, business trust, joint venture or limited liability
company either (A)(i) has been treated since its formation and continues to be
treated for federal income tax purposes either as a partnership or as an entity
that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or
as an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of
its formation or the acquisition by PREIT of a direct or indirect interest
therein, owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would
cause PREIT to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code or (B) has been treated for
federal income tax purposes as a corporation that qualifies as (x) a REIT within
the meaning of Section 856 of the Code, (y) a qualified REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(i) of the Code, or (z) a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section
856(l) of the Code. PREIT Partnership is not a publicly traded partnership
within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is taxable as a
corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code. For all tax years in which
the IRS could assert a tax liability, each PREIT Subsidiary which is a
corporation and each other issuer in which PREIT holds or has held securities
(within the meaning of Section 856(c)(4) of the Code but excluding "straight
debt" of issuers described in Section 856(c)(7)) having a value of more than 10%
of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer has qualified at
all times as either a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code, a
qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, or a taxable REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.14(b) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary
holds any asset (x) the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar
to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of IRS Notice 88-19, Temporary Treas.
Regs. ss.1.337(d)-5T, ss.1.337(d)-6T or ss.1.337(d)-7T, or (y) which is subject
to a consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder.

                           (c) To PREIT's Knowledge, as of the date hereof,
PREIT is a "domestically-controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section
897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.

                           (d) There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of
PREIT or the PREIT Subsidiaries, other than liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable.

                           (e) Neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary is party
to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement.

                           (f) PREIT does not have any liability for the Taxes
of any person other than PREIT and the PREIT Subsidiaries, and the PREIT
Subsidiaries do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than
PREIT and the PREIT Subsidiaries (A) under Treas. Reg.ss.1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (B) as transferee or
successor, (C) by contract, or (D) otherwise.

                           (g) PREIT and the PREIT Subsidiaries have not taken
any positions on any of their federal income Tax returns which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to a substantial underpayment of Tax under Section 6662
of the Code.

                           (h) Neither PREIT nor any of the PREIT Subsidiaries
will be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of
deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending after the Effective Time as a result of any: (A) change in method of
accounting for taxable period ending on or prior to the Effective Time under
Code Section 481(c) (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local
or foreign income Tax law); (B) "closing agreement" as described in Code Section
7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Effective Time; (C) installment sale
or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Effective Time; or (D)
prepaid amount received on or prior to the Effective Time.

                  3.15 No Payments to Employees, Officers or Trustees. Except as
described in Schedule 3.15 to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, or as otherwise
provided for in this Agreement, there is no employment or severance contract, or
other agreement requiring payments, cancellation of indebtedness or other
obligation to be made on a change of control or otherwise as a result of the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a
result of a termination of service subsequent to the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any employee,
officer, director or trustee of PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary. Except as
described in Schedule 3.15 to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, there is no agreement
or arrangement with any employee, officer or other service provider under which
PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary has agreed to pay any tax that might be owed under
Section 4999 of the Code with respect to payments to such individuals.

                  3.16 Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Lehman Brothers
Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid
by PREIT and are described in the engagement letters dated April 1, 2002 and
March 5, 2003 between Lehman Brothers Inc. and PREIT and Salomon Smith Barney
Inc. and PREIT, respectively, true, correct and complete copies of which have
previously been given to Crown, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of PREIT or any
PREIT Subsidiary.

                  3.17 Compliance with Laws. Neither PREIT nor any PREIT
Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity or award
to any arbitration applicable to its business, properties or operations, except
in each case to the extent that such violation or failure would not reasonably
be expected to have a PREIT Material Adverse Effect.

                  3.18 Contracts; Debt Instruments.

                           (a) Default. Neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary
(i) has received a written notice in 2002 or 2003 that it is in violation of or
in default under any lease to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets is bound or (ii) has received a written notice that it is
in violation of or in default under (or that there exists any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would reasonably be
expected to cause such a violation of or default under) any (A) loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, debenture, indenture, or (B) material permit,
concession, franchise, license or any other material contract, agreement,
arrangement or understanding, to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound, and no such violation or default exists.

                           (b) Indebtedness. Schedule 3.18(b) to the PREIT
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture and any other agreement or instrument pursuant to
which any Indebtedness of PREIT or any of the PREIT Subsidiaries, is outstanding
or may be incurred.

                           (c) Interest Rate Agreements. To the extent not set

Schedule 3.18(d) to the PREIT Disclosure Letter, neither PREIT nor any PREIT

to any of the PREIT Properties.

Subsidiary has entered into or is subject, directly or indirectly, to any PREIT
Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, a "PREIT Tax Protection Agreement" is

for federal income tax purposes, and that (i) prohibits or restricts in any

allocating one or more liabilities of PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary under
Section 752 of the Code. Neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary is in violation
of or in default under any PREIT Tax Protection Agreement.

                  3.19 Opinion of Financial Advisor. PREIT has received the
written opinion of Lehman Brothers Inc., PREIT's financial advisor, to the
effect that the consideration to be paid by PREIT and PREIT Partnership in
connection with the Merger, including the transactions contemplated by the Crown
Partnership Contribution Agreement, is fair, from a financial point of view, to
PREIT.

                                  (ii) Crown, Crown Partnership and each Crown
Subsidiary will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any officer,
director, trustee, employee, affiliate, agent, investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant, broker, finder, consultant or other agent or
representative of Crown, Crown Partnership or any Crown Subsidiary (each, a
"Crown Representative") not to engage in any of the activities described in

                                  (iii) (A) it, Crown Partnership and the Crown
Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing (including, without limitation, any
Acquisition Proposal) and will take commercially reasonable actions to inform
each Crown Representative, and each of the Persons referred to in Section
4.3(b), of the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.3 and to cause each
Crown Representative to comply with such obligations, and (B) it shall promptly
request each Person, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement
within the twenty-four month period prior to the date hereof in connection with
its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of
it, Crown Partnership and the Crown Subsidiaries; and

                                  (iv) it will (A) notify PREIT promptly (but in
any event within 24 hours), orally and in writing, if it, Crown Partnership, any
Crown Subsidiary or any Crown Representative receives (1) an Acquisition
Proposal or any amendment or change in any previously received Acquisition
Proposal (2) any request for confidential or nonpublic information or data
relating to, or for access to the properties, books or records of, it, Crown
Partnership or any Crown Subsidiary by any Person that has made, or to such
party's knowledge may be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, or (3) any
oral or written expression that any such activities, discussions or negotiations
are sought to be initiated or continued with it, and, as applicable, include in
such notice the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request and, if in writing, shall promptly deliver to PREIT copies

                           (b) Notwithstanding Section 4.3(a), the Board of
Trustees of Crown (including with respect to Crown's capacity as the sole
general partner of Crown Partnership) shall not be prohibited from furnishing
information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person
that makes a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Trustees of
Crown after the date hereof which was not invited, initiated, solicited or
encouraged, directly or indirectly, by Crown, Crown Partnership, any Crown
Subsidiary or any Crown Representative on or after the date hereof, if, and only
to the extent that (i) a majority of the Board of Trustees of Crown determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation and after receiving advice from its outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) each of Crown and Crown Partnership complies fully
with Section 4.3, (iii) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, Crown provides written
notice to PREIT to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or entering
into discussions with such Person and (iv) Crown receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement the material terms of which are (without
regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects no
less favorable to Crown, and no less restrictive to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements,
each dated July 2, 2002, as amended on February 4, 2003, between Crown and PREIT
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").

                           (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in Section 4.3(a) or 4.3(b), in the event that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal, nothing contained in this Section
4.3 shall prohibit the Board of Trustees of Crown from withdrawing, modifying,
amending or qualifying its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger as
required under Section 5.1(d) hereof and recommending such Superior Acquisition
Proposal to its shareholders: (i) if but only if, Crown: (A) complies fully with
this Section 4.3 and (B) provides PREIT with at least five business days' prior
written notice of its intent to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify its
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) if, in the event that
during such five business days PREIT makes a counter proposal to such Superior
Acquisition Proposal (any such counter proposal being referred to in this
Agreement as the "PREIT Counter Proposal"), Crown's Board of Trustees in good
faith, taking into account the advice of its outside financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, determines (A) that the PREIT Counter Proposal
is not at least as favorable to Crown's shareholders as the Superior Acquisition
Proposal, from a financial point of view, and (B) the PREIT Counter Proposal is
not at least as favorable generally to Crown's shareholders (taking into account
all financial and strategic considerations and other relevant factors, including
relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and
the conditions, prospects and time required for completion of such proposal),
and (iii) Crown shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1(h).

                           (d) For all purposes of this Agreement, "Superior
Acquisition Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal made by a third party
to acquire, directly or indirectly, Crown, Crown Partnership and CFLP pursuant
to a tender or exchange offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation or sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of Crown, Crown Partnership, and the
Crown Subsidiaries or otherwise (i) on terms which a majority of the Board of
Trustees of Crown determines in good faith, (A) after consultation with Crown's
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, are superior, from a
financial point of view, to Crown's shareholders to those provided for in the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) to be more
favorable generally to Crown's shareholders (taking into account all financial
and strategic considerations and other relevant factors, including relevant
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and the
conditions, prospects and time required for completion of such proposal), (ii)
for which financing, to the extent required, in the reasonable judgment of the
Board of Trustees is capable of being obtained and (iii) which the Board of
Trustees of Crown determines in good faith is reasonably capable of being
consummated.

                           (e) Any disclosure that the Board of Trustees of
Crown may be compelled to make with respect to the receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal in order to comply with its duties to shareholders imposed by
applicable law or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the Exchange Act will not constitute a
violation of this Section 4.3.

                           (f) Nothing in this Section 4.3 shall (i) permit
Crown or PREIT to terminate this Agreement (except as expressly provided in
Article 7) or (ii) affect any other obligations of Crown or PREIT under this
Agreement.

                  4.4 Affiliates. Prior to the Effective Time, Crown shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to PREIT a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel
for PREIT) identifying all Persons who, at the time of the Crown Shareholders
Meeting and the PREIT Shareholders Meeting, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of
Crown or Crown Partnership as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

                  4.5 Other Actions. Each of Crown and Crown Partnership, on the
one hand, and PREIT and PREIT Partnership, on the other hand, shall not take,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to take, any action that would result in (i) any of the
representations and warranties of such party (without giving effect to any
"knowledge" qualification) set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to
materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of such representations and warranties
(without giving effect to any "knowledge" qualification) that are not so
qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (iii) except as expressly
required by Section 4.3, any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article 6 not being satisfied.

                           (a) As promptly as practicable after execution of
this Agreement, (i) Crown and PREIT shall prepare and file with the SEC (with
appropriate requests for confidential treatment, unless the parties hereto
otherwise agree) under the Exchange Act, one or more joint proxy
statements/prospectuses, forms of proxies and information statements (such joint
proxy statement(s)/prospectus(es) and information statements together with any
amendments to supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement") relating to the
shareholder meeting of Crown and the shareholder meeting of PREIT, the vote of
the shareholders of Crown and the shareholders of PREIT with respect to the
Merger, and the consent, if any, of partners of Crown Partnership and PREIT
Partnership in connection with any required Partner Approvals and (ii) in
connection with the clearance by the SEC of the Joint Proxy Statement, PREIT and
Crown, if applicable, shall prepare and file with the SEC under the Securities
Act one or more registration statements on Form S-4 (such registration
statements, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Form
S-4"), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included, as one or more
prospectuses in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the
PREIT Common Shares and PREIT Senior Preferred Shares to be distributed to the
holders of Crown Common Shares and Crown Senior Preferred Shares in the Merger.
The respective parties will cause the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 to comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each

Each of PREIT and Crown, if applicable, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and Crown will cooperate with PREIT, to have the Form S-4 declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable (including clearing the Proxy
Statement with the SEC). Each of Crown and Crown Partnership, on the one hand,

any information provided by it for use in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and each of the parties hereto further
agrees to take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 and to cause the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form

respective meetings of shareholders of Crown and PREIT and at the time of the
respective taking of consents, if any, of partners of Crown Partnership and
PREIT Partnership, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. PREIT will advise and deliver copies (if any) to Crown,
forthwith after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information (regardless
of whether such requests relate to PREIT or PREIT Partnership, on the one hand,
and Crown or Crown Partnership, on the other hand), and PREIT shall forthwith
notify Crown, and Crown shall promptly notify PREIT, if applicable, of (i) the
time when the Form S-4 has become effective, (ii) the filing of any supplement
or amendment thereto, (iii) the issuance of any stop order, and (iv) the

Form S-4 shall become effective and as of the Effective Time, addressed to PREIT
and PREIT Partnership, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to PREIT
and PREIT Partnership, concerning the procedures undertaken by Ernst & Young
with respect to the financial statements and information of Crown, Crown

matters described in clause (i) of Section 6.2(d) and Section 6.3(e) and such

affidavits, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer
or gains, sales, use, transfer, mortgage, value added stock transfer and stamp
taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to
tax, "Transfer and Gains Taxes"). From and after the Effective Time, except as
expressly provided for in Section 9 of the Pasquerilla Tax Protection Agreement
(as defined in Section 5.13(e)), PREIT shall pay or cause PREIT Partnership, as
appropriate, to pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and Gains Taxes (which term
shall not in any event be construed to include for these purposes any Tax
imposed under the Code or state or local income tax laws).

                  5.8 Benefit Plans and Other Employee Arrangements.

                           (a) Access to Employees. Neither PREIT nor any PREIT
Subsidiary shall be obligated to hire any employee of Crown Partnership or CASC
following the Merger, but may interview some or all such employees with a view
to possible employment. From and after the date hereof, Crown, Crown Partnership
and CASC shall provide reasonable access to the facilities and personnel records
consisting of performance appraisals and disciplinary actions of Crown, Crown
Partnership and CASC for the purpose of preparing for and conducting employment
interviews and shall permit any employee of Crown Partnership or CASC to
interview with PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary, and PREIT or any PREIT Subsidiary
will conduct such interviews as expeditiously as possible prior to the Closing
Date. Within 90 days of the date hereof, PREIT shall provide Crown a list of all
those employees of Crown Partnership and CASC to whom PREIT or a PREIT
Subsidiary (the "Successor Employer") intends to make an offer of employment to
be effective on the Closing Date ("Solicited Employees"), and, within 30 days of
delivering such list of Solicited Employees, the Successor Employer shall notify
Crown, Crown Partnership and CASC of each Solicited Employee who has accepted an
offer of employment to be effective on the Closing Date (the "Hired Employees").
The Successor Employer shall include in any offer of employment a provision to
the effect that acceptance of such offer shall constitute a resignation of
employment with Crown Partnership or CASC, as the case may be, effective
immediately before the Closing Date. If the Successor Employer expresses an


                                      -84-
<PAGE>

intention to extend offers of employment as set forth in this Section 5.8(a),
any such expression shall not constitute a commitment, contract or understanding
(expressed or implied) or any obligation on the part of the Successor Employer
with respect to a post-Closing employment relationship of any fixed term or
duration or upon any terms or conditions other than those that the Successor
Employer may establish pursuant to individual offers of employment. Nothing in
this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of the Successor Employer
or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Hired Employees for
any period or to continue to pay any salaries comparable to those previously
paid or provided by Crown, Crown Partnership or CASC or, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Section 5.8, to continue to provide any benefits of
employment. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or restrict in
any way the right of the Successor Employer to reassign, promote or demote any
of the Hired Employees after the Closing, or to change adversely or favorably
the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, or terms or
conditions of employment of such employees. In addition, no Person shall be
deemed a third party-beneficiary of this Section 5.8 entitled to enforce its
provisions.

                           (b) Termination of Crown Partnership Employees. Other
than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices,
without the written consent of PREIT, Crown, Crown Partnership and CASC shall
not terminate any employees except as provided in the next sentence. Effective
immediately before the Closing, Crown Partnership and CASC shall terminate the
employment of all of their employees, other than the Hired Employees. Crown
Partnership and CASC, to the extent practicable, shall comply with the WARN Act
and any similar state or local Law in connection with the termination of their
employees and Crown Partnership and CASC shall provide PREIT with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any notices to be delivered in connection
with such terminations prior to delivery thereof. In any event, Crown
Partnership and CASC shall give at least two weeks notice to any employee who is
to be terminated. At Closing, PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary shall deposit with a
third-party escrow agent identified by Crown and reasonably acceptable to PREIT
an amount mutually agreed upon by Crown and PREIT equal to a reasonable estimate
of the aggregate severance payments that are required to be made to employees of
Crown, Crown Partnership and CASC pursuant to the Crown Employee Plans as a
result of the resignations and terminations of employment contemplated by
Sections 5.8(a) and 5.8(b) hereof. Within 10 business days of the Closing Date,
PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary shall cause to be paid from such escrow deposit any
such severance payments required to be made pursuant to the Crown Employee
Plans, less any required withholding. Any balance remaining from such escrow
deposit after such payments shall be paid to PREIT, or, if additional funds are
required to be paid, such amounts shall be paid by PREIT. In furtherance of the


                                      -85-
<PAGE>

foregoing, PREIT agrees that, for purposes of the Crown Partnership Special
Severance Plan and the employees covered thereby, any resignation of employment
by employees pursuant to Section 5.8(a) shall be deemed to constitute a
voluntary termination by the employee to accept a position with an acquiror of
Crown or Crown Partnership in connection with or anticipation of a "Change of
Control" within the meaning of such plan; any termination of employment of
employees pursuant to Section 5.8(b) shall be deemed to constitute a termination
of employment by employer action other than for "cause" in connection with or
anticipation of a "Change of Control" within the meaning of such plan; and
employees who resign or are terminated pursuant to Section 5.8(a) or (b) shall
be entitled to a "Severance Allowance", which lump sum amount, less any required
withholding, shall be paid by PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary within 10 business
days of the Closing Date in the manner provided above. For purposes of Crown
Partnership's Employment Continuation agreements, PREIT agrees that signing this
Agreement shall constitute a "Potential Change of Control" as defined therein,
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein shall constitute a "Change
of Control" under such agreements, termination of employment of those employees
covered by such agreements by Crown Partnership shall be a termination by Crown
Partnership other than for "Cause", resignation of employment by those employees
covered by such agreements shall be a termination with "Good Reason", and those
employees shall be entitled to a "Severance Amount" and continuation of benefits
as provided for in such agreements, which lump sum Severance Amount, less any
required withholding, shall be paid by PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary within 10
business days of the Closing Date in the manner provided above and which
employee benefits will be continued by PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary for those
employees for the time period specified in such agreements. Furthermore, PREIT
or a PREIT Subsidiary shall assume the Employment Continuation Agreements
entered into as of February 25, 2002 by Crown Partnership and Messrs.
Pasquerilla, Stephenson, Griffith, Zucco, Antonazzo, Rusinak, Washko and Stevens
and Ms. Furman-Jankovic, respectively. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, but except as provided in the preceding sentence,
neither PREIT nor any PREIT Subsidiary shall assume any other Employee Plan of
Crown Partnership that provides for severance or similar benefits in the nature
of severance.

                           (c) Benefit Plans. As of the Effective Time, and
except as set forth in Section 5.8(e) hereof, the Successor Employer expressly
assumes and agrees to perform the obligations of Crown, Crown Partnership and
CASC under each Crown Employee Plan, including those set forth on Schedule 2.12
to the Crown Disclosure Letter, but excluding those stock option plans and
agreements which are covered by Sections 5.8(f) and 5.8(g) and severance pay
plans, arrangements and agreements which are covered by Section 5.8(b), and all
of the liabilities and obligations of Crown and Crown Partnership associated
therewith (the "Assumed Employee Plans"), in each case to the same extent as
Crown, Crown Partnership or CASC, as the case may be, would be required to
perform (and with the same ability to amend, suspend, or terminate each such
Crown Employee Plan as Crown, Crown Partnership and CASC, as the case may be,
would have had) if no transactions contemplated by this Agreement had taken
place. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Successor Employer
shall assume and make available group health coverage and perform all COBRA


                                      -86-
<PAGE>

obligations for the applicable COBRA period with respect to all Crown, Crown
Partnership and CASC employees and former employees, including (i) employees of
Crown, Crown Partnership and CASC who resign or who are terminated as provided
in Sections 5.8(a) and 5.8(b) hereof, (ii) employees of Crown, Crown Partnership
and CASC who are terminated between the date hereof and the Closing Date, and
(iii) former employees of Crown, Crown Partnership and CASC, including those
disclosed on Schedule 2.12(a) to the Crown Disclosure Letter who have elected or
who are eligible to elect COBRA coverage. All Hired Employees shall be eligible
to either (i) participate in any pension, retirement, savings, disability,
medical, dental, health, life, death benefit, group insurance, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, stock option, equity compensation, bonus, incentive,
vacation pay, tuition reimbursement, severance pay, employment continuation,
change of control, fringe benefit or other employee benefit plan, trust,
agreement, contract, policy or commitment (including, without limitation, any
Pension Plan and any Welfare Plan) (each, an "Employee Plan") sponsored or
maintained by the Successor Employer after the Effective Time on the same terms
and conditions as similarly situated employees of the Successor Employer,
subject to the terms and conditions of such plans, or (ii) continue
participation in any Assumed Employee Plan, until such time, if ever, as such
Hired Employees become participants in the Employee Plans maintained by the
Successor Employer as provided in (i), subject to the terms and conditions
thereof. The particular clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence under which
Hired Employees are eligible shall be determined by the Successor Employer in
its discretion. With respect to each such Employee Plan or Assumed Employee
Plan, service with Crown or any Crown Subsidiary (as applicable) and the
predecessor of any of them by any Hired Employee shall be included for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and
determination of the level of entitlement to, benefits under such Employee Plan;
provided, however, that such service shall not be included for purposes of
benefit accrual under any Pension Plan. PREIT shall, or shall cause the
Successor Employer to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to all Hired Employees under any Welfare Plan that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any
Welfare Plan maintained for such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) provide each Hired Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Welfare Plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.

<PAGE>

                           (d) Crown Section 401(k) Plan. Prior to the Closing
Date, Crown Partnership shall file a proposal with the IRS through the IRS's
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System as to how to correct the failure to
amend properly the Crown Retirement Savings Plan to eliminate all benefit
options other than lump sums. Crown shall obtain PREIT's prior written approval
to the proposal, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. For Hired
Employees, due to the Successor Employer's assumption of the Crown Retirement
Savings Plan ("401(k) Plan"), a termination of employment pursuant to Section
5.8(b) or resignation under Section 5.8(a) shall not be deemed to be a
termination of employment for purposes of distributions under such 401(k) Plan
and neither the Successor Employer nor Crown shall offer a distribution to such
Hired Employees as a result of the transactions described herein. The Successor
Employer acknowledges that its assumption of the 401(k) Plan includes assumption
of all liabilities under such 401(k) Plan, including liabilities relating to
employees and former employees who are not Hired Employees.

                           (e) Stock Option, Restricted Stock and Top-Hat Plans.
The stock option plans or programs of Crown and the restricted stock plans or
programs of Crown shall be discontinued as of the Closing Date. The
non-qualified deferred compensation plans or programs of Crown, including
without limitation the Amended and Restated Key Executive Capital Incentive Plan
and Savings Restoration Plan of Crown Partnership (the "Top-Hat Plans"), and the
rabbi trusts maintained pursuant to the terms of such plans or programs (i)
shall be assumed by the Successor Employer as of the Effective Time, (ii) all
contributions to such plans or programs shall cease as of the Effective Time,
and (iii) no new employees shall be eligible to enter such plans or programs on
or after the Effective Time.

                           (f) Crown Trustee Options. As of the Effective Time,
each Crown Trustee Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
determined without regard to the termination or resignation of service by any
optionee, shall be automatically converted into an option (a "Substituted
Trustee Option") to purchase a number of PREIT Common Shares equal to the number
of Crown Common Shares that could have been purchased (assuming full vesting)
under such Crown Trustee Option multiplied by 0.3589 (rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares) at an exercise price per PREIT Common Share
equal to the per-share option exercise price specified in the Crown Trustee
Option divided by 0.3589 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Such
Substituted Trustee Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as such Crown Trustee Option; provided, however, that such
Substituted Trustee Option shall be fully vested as of the Effective Time and
shall, notwithstanding its terms, be and remain exercisable until the earlier of
(i) six months from the Effective Time or (ii) the expiration date of such stock
option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and without regard
to the optionee's resignation or other termination of service. For purposes of
expiration and otherwise, the deemed date of grant of the Substituted Trustee
Option shall be the date on which the corresponding Crown Trustee Option was
granted, and, except as provided in the preceding sentence, any termination or
resignation of service shall be given the same effect as would have applied
without regard to the Merger. In respect of each Crown Trustee Option converted
into a Substituted Trustee Option, and the PREIT Common Shares underlying such
Substituted Trustee Option, PREIT shall, immediately following the date of
conversion, file or shall have filed, and shall keep current a Registration
Statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate registration statement for as long as
Substituted Trustee Options remain outstanding.

<PAGE>

                           (g) Crown Partnership Options. As of the Effective
Time, each Crown Partnership Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, determined without regard to the termination or resignation of
service by any optionee, shall be automatically converted into an option (a
"Substituted Partnership Option") to purchase a number of PREIT Common Shares
equal to the number of Crown Partnership Units that could have been purchased
(assuming full vesting) under such Crown Partnership Option multiplied by 0.3589
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) at an exercise price per
PREIT Common Share equal to the per-share option exercise price specified in the
Crown Partnership Option divided by 0.3589 (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent). Such Substituted Partnership Option shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions as such Crown Partnership Option; provided, however,
that (i) each Substituted Partnership Option held by a Hired Employee shall
become fully vested on (A) the later of March 31, 2004 or the last day of the
first full calendar quarter that begins on or after the Closing Date (as the
case may be, the "Option Date"), provided, in either case, that such Hired
Employee remains an employee of PREIT or a PREIT Subsidiary on the Option Date,
or (B) if earlier than the Option Date, the date of such employee's termination
of employment by the Successor Employer for any reason other than for "Cause" as
defined in Crown Partnership's Employment Continuation agreements, (ii) each
Substituted Partnership Option held by a person who was an employee of Crown,
Crown Partnership or CASC immediately prior to the Closing Date but who either
is not a Solicited Employee or is a Solicited Employee but whose offer of
employment by the Successor Employer is conditioned upon such Solicited Employee
relocating on or before the Option Date to a work location more than 25 miles
from such Solicited Employee's current work location and/or is conditioned upon
a material reduction in compensation as compared with such Solicited Employee's
compensation with Crown Partnership or CASC immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and who does not accept such offer of employment, shall become fully
vested at the Effective Time, (iii) each Substituted Partnership Option
specified in the foregoing clause (i) that vests upon the date of such Hired
Employee's termination of employment by the Successor Employer shall,
notwithstanding its terms, be and remain exercisable until the earlier of (A)
six months from the date of such employee's termination of employment by the
Successor Employer or (B) the expiration date of such stock option as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and without regard to the optionee's
termination of employment, and (iv) each Substituted Partnership Option
specified in the foregoing clause (ii) shall, notwithstanding its terms, be and
remain exercisable until the earlier of (A) six months from the Effective Time
or (B) the expiration date of such stock option as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time and without regard to the optionee's termination or
resignation of employment. For purposes of expiration and otherwise, the deemed
date of grant of the Substituted Partnership Option shall be the date on which
the corresponding Crown Partnership Option was granted, and, except as provided


                                      -89-
<PAGE>

in the preceding sentence, (x) each Substituted Partnership Option held by a
Hired Employee shall be treated as if such Hired Employee had never been
terminated by Crown Partnership and (y) each other Substituted Partnership
Option shall be treated according to the terms of such Substituted Partnership
Option taking into account the termination or resignation of the holder thereof.
In respect of each Crown Partnership Option converted into a Substituted
Partnership Option, and the PREIT Common Shares underlying such Substituted
Partnership Option, PREIT shall, immediately following the date of conversion,
file or shall have filed, and shall keep current a Registration Statement on
Form S-8 or other appropriate registration statement for as long as Substituted
Partnership Options remain outstanding.

                           (h) Withholding. To the extent required by applicable
law, Crown shall require each employee and trustee who exercises a Crown Option,
Crown Partnership Option or who receives Crown Common Shares pursuant to any
existing commitment to pay to Crown in cash or Crown Common Shares an amount
sufficient to satisfy in full Crown's obligation to withhold Taxes incurred by
reason of such exercise or issuance (unless and to the extent such withholding
is satisfied pursuant to the provision regarding withholding in Section
1.11(c)).

                  5.9 Indemnification.

                           (a) From and after the Effective Time, PREIT and
PREIT Partnership (collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties") shall provide
exculpation and indemnification for each individual who is now or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an
officer, director or trustee of Crown or any Crown Subsidiary (the "Indemnified
Parties") which is the same as the exculpation and indemnification (including
any applicable provisions for payment) provided to the Indemnified Parties by
Crown and the Crown Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time in its
charter, Bylaws or in its partnership, operating or similar agreement, as in
effect on the date hereof; provided, that no such exculpation or indemnification
(including any applicable provisions for payment) shall be provided by PREIT or
PREIT Partnership to Mark E. Pasquerilla for any threatened or actual "Claims"
(as defined in the Indemnification Agreement) that are described in Section
2.1(a) of the Indemnification Agreement (whether or not PREIT or PREIT
Partnership is actually entitled to or receives indemnification).

                                      -90-
<PAGE>

                           (b) In addition to the rights provided in Section
5.9(a) above, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any action by or on behalf of any or all security
holders of Crown or PREIT, or any Crown Subsidiary or PREIT Subsidiary, or by or
in the right of Crown or PREIT, or any Crown Subsidiary or PREIT Subsidiary, or
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any individual who
is now, or has been, at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an officer, employee, director or trustee of Crown or any
Crown Subsidiary (the "Indemnification Parties") is, or is threatened to be,
made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was an officer, employee,
director or trustee of Crown or any of the Crown Subsidiaries or any action or
omission by such individual in his capacity as a trustee, or (ii) this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether in any case asserted
or arising before or after the Effective Time, the Indemnifying Parties shall,
from and after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
full extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnification Party against any
losses, claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in accordance
herewith in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation. Any Indemnification Party proposing to assert the
right to be indemnified under this Section 5.9(b) shall, promptly after receipt
of notice of commencement of any action against such Indemnification Party in
respect of which a claim is to be made under this Section 5.9(b) against the
Indemnifying Parties, notify the Indemnifying Parties of the commencement of
such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served; provided, however, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of the
Indemnifying Parties except to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Parties' ability to defend such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation; and provided further, however, that, in the case of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending, to the Knowledge
of Crown, at the Effective Time, Crown shall notify PREIT pursuant to this
Section 5.9(b) prior to such Effective Time. If any such action is brought
against any of the Indemnification Parties and such Indemnification Parties
notify the Indemnifying Parties of its commencement, the Indemnifying Parties
will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that they elect by
delivering written notice to such Indemnification Parties promptly after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the Indemnification
Parties, to assume the defense of the action and after notice from the
Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnification Parties of their election to assume
the defense, the Indemnifying Parties will not be liable to the Indemnification
Parties for any legal or other expenses except as provided below. If the
Indemnifying Parties assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties shall have the
right to settle such action without the consent of the Indemnification Parties;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Parties shall be required to obtain
such consent if the settlement includes any admission of wrongdoing on the part
of the Indemnification Parties or any decree or restriction on the
Indemnification Parties; provided further, however, that no Indemnifying
Parties, in the defense of any such action shall, except with the consent of the
Indemnification Parties, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnification Parties of a release from


                                      -91-
<PAGE>

all liability with respect to such action, or (ii) contains obligations other
than with respect to the payment of money. The Indemnification Parties will have
the right to employ their own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses
and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnification
Parties unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnification Parties has
been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (ii) the Indemnification
Parties have reasonably concluded (based on written advice of counsel to the
Indemnification Parties) that there may be legal defenses available to them that
are different from or in addition to and inconsistent with those available to
the Indemnifying Parties, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based
on written advice of counsel to the Indemnification Parties) between the
Indemnification Parties and the Indemnifying Parties (in which case the
Indemnifying Parties will not have the right to direct the defense of such
action on behalf of the Indemnification Parties) or (iv) the Indemnifying
Parties have not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action
within a reasonable time (not to exceed 10 days) after receiving notice of the
commencement of the action from the Indemnification Parties, in each of which
cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at
the expense of the Indemnifying Parties and shall promptly be paid by each
Indemnifying Party as they become due and payable in advance of the final
disposition of the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the
fullest extent and in the manner permitted by law; provided, however, that in no
event shall any contingent fee arrangement be considered reasonable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated
to advance any expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the Indemnification Party to repay any expenses advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that the Indemnification Party is not entitled to be
indemnified against such expense pursuant to the last sentence of this Section
5.9(b). It is understood that the Indemnifying Parties shall not, in connection
with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable
for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one
separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all
such Indemnification Parties unless (a) the employment of more than one counsel
has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (b) any of the
Indemnification Parties have reasonably concluded (based on written advice of
counsel to the Indemnification Parties) that there may be legal defenses
available to them that are different from or in addition to and inconsistent
with those available to other Indemnification Parties or (c) a conflict or
potential conflict exists (based on written advice of counsel to the
Indemnification Parties) between any of the Indemnification Parties and the
other Indemnification Parties, in each case of which the Indemnifying Parties
shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional


                                      -92-
<PAGE>

counsel or counsels on the same basis as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent and (ii) shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnification Party to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable law. In the event of a final and
non-appealable determination by a court that any payment of expenses is
prohibited by applicable law, the Indemnification Parties shall promptly refund
to the Indemnifying Parties the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced
pursuant hereto.

                           (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, PREIT shall
purchase trustees', directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time for a period of six years
with respect to those individuals who are currently covered by Crown's
trustees', directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (the "Crown
Insured Parties") on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less
favorable to Crown's trustees and officers currently covered by such insurance
than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that
if the premium of such insurance policy exceeds 200% of the premium of such
policy in effect on the date hereof, PREIT shall be required only to purchase
such comparable coverage as available for an amount not to exceed 200% of the
premium of such policy in effect on the date hereof; and provided further,
however, that during such six year period, in no event shall PREIT provide
insurance coverage that is less favorable to the Crown Insured Parties than is
maintained by PREIT for its trustees and officers.

                           (d) This Section 5.9 is intended for the irrevocable
benefit of, and to grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnification Parties and their successors, assigns and heirs and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of PREIT and PREIT Operating Partnership.
Each of the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnification Parties shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 and PREIT and
PREIT Partnership acknowledge and agree that each Indemnified Party and
Indemnification Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy
at law exists for a breach of such covenants and such Indemnified Party or such
Indemnification Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific
performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this Section 5.9.

                                      -93-
<PAGE>

                           (e) If PREIT or PREIT Partnership or any of its
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case the successors
and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.9, which obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director, trustee and officer
covered hereby.

                  5.10 Declaration of Dividends and Distributions. From and
after the date of this Agreement, except as provided for in Section 1.11(d),
neither Crown nor PREIT shall make any dividend or distribution to its
respective shareholders without the prior written consent of the other party;
provided, however, the written consent of the other party shall not be required
for the authorization and payment of (a) distributions at their respective
stated dividend or distribution rates with respect to Crown Senior Preferred
Shares, (b) quarterly distributions with respect to the Crown Common Shares of
$.2125 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and $.2150 per share for
the quarter ending June 30, 2003 and for each quarter thereafter and (c)
quarterly distributions with respect to the PREIT Common Shares of up to $.54
per share; provided, however, the record and payment dates for each distribution
with respect to the Crown Common Shares shall be the same dates as the record
and payment dates, respectively, for the quarterly distribution for the PREIT
Common Shares, such record and payment dates to be mutually and reasonably
agreed to by Crown and PREIT. From and after the date of this Agreement, except
as provided in Section 1.11(d), Crown Partnership shall not make any
distribution to the holders of Crown OP Units except a distribution per Crown OP
Unit in the same amount as a dividend per Crown Common Share or Crown Preferred
Share permitted pursuant to this Section 5.10, with the same record and payment
dates as such dividend on the Crown Common Share or the Crown Preferred Share,
as applicable. From and after the date of this Agreement, except as provided in
Section 1.11(d) and except as contemplated in the Crown Partnership Distribution
Agreement, PREIT Partnership shall not make any distribution to the holders of
PREIT OP Units except a distribution per PREIT OP Unit in the same amount as a
dividend per PREIT Common Share permitted pursuant to this Section 5.10, with
the same record and payment dates as such dividend on the PREIT Common Share, as
applicable. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply, however, (i) to PREIT to
the extent a distribution (or an increase in a distribution) by PREIT is
necessary for PREIT to maintain REIT status, avoid the incurrence of any taxes
under Section 857 of the Code, avoid the imposition of any excise taxes under
Section 4981 of the Code, or avoid the need to make one or more extraordinary or
disproportionately larger distributions to meet any of the three preceding
objectives (or to any corresponding distributions or increases in distributions
paid by PREIT Partnership), (ii) to PREIT and PREIT Partnership with respect to
any Corresponding PREIT Dividends and Distributions (as provided for in Section

circumstance or occurrence that was in the control of PREIT or PREIT Partnership
or (B) any event, circumstance or occurrence that was not in the control of
PREIT or PREIT Partnership, such that, in the case of (x) or (y), the condition
set forth in Section 6.3(a) would be incapable of being satisfied by February
27, 2004; provided, however, if a breach described in this Section 7.1(c)(ii) is
curable on or before February 20, 2004 without PREIT or PREIT Partnership
breaching or failing to perform any covenant, obligation or agreement under this
Agreement, then only upon the failure of PREIT or PREIT Partnership to cure such
breach or failure within ten business days after PREIT or PREIT Partnership has
received written notice from Crown requesting cure of such breach or failure (or
as extended by mutual written agreement, or, if such breach or failure could not
reasonably be expected to be cured within such ten business days and PREIT and
PREIT Partnership promptly commence such cure after receipt of notice from Crown

                  7.2 Termination After the Pre-Merger Transfer Date. This
Agreement may be terminated at any time after the Pre-Merger Transfer Date and
prior to the Effective Time only by:

                           (a) either PREIT or Crown, if any judgment,
injunction, order, decree or action by any Governmental Entity of competent
authority preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have become final and
non-appealable;

                           (b) PREIT or PREIT Partnership, if, subject to
Section 1.4 of this Agreement, any of Crown, Crown Partnership or the
Pasquerilla Group has failed to perform in any material respect any covenant,
obligation or agreement on the part of Crown or Crown Partnership required to be
performed on the Closing Date (unless Crown or Crown Partnership has the right
to terminate pursuant to Section 7.2(c)); or

                           (c) Crown or Crown Partnership, if, subject to
Section 1.4 of this Agreement, PREIT or PREIT Partnership shall have failed to
perform in any material respect any covenant, obligation or agreement on the
part of PREIT or PREIT Partnership required to be performed on the Closing Date
(unless PREIT or PREIT Partnership has the right to terminate pursuant to
Section 7.2(b)).

                  7.3 Certain Fees and Expenses. (a) If this Agreement shall be
terminated (i) pursuant to Sections 7.1(h) or 7.1(i), then Crown and Crown
Partnership shall pay to PREIT Partnership a fee equal to the Break-Up Fee, or
(ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (other than Section 7.1(b)(ii)(y)(B)) or Section
7.1(f) (provided that with respect to Section 7.1(f) the PREIT Shareholder
Approval shall have been obtained), then Crown and Crown Partnership shall pay
to PREIT Partnership (provided that Crown was not entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at the time of such termination) an amount
equal to the Break-Up Expenses. If this Agreement shall be terminated (i)
pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and such judgment, injunction, order, decree or
action is primarily the result of any action or inaction by Crown or Crown
Partnership in breach of this Agreement or the result of Crown or Crown
Partnership seeking or assisting a third-party in seeking such judgment,
injunction, order, decree or action, or (ii) by Crown or Crown Partnership
pursuant to Section 7.1(e), and prior to the time of such termination, in either


                                     -107-
<PAGE>

case, an Acquisition Proposal (in the case of this Section 7.3 only, the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be modified as follows: the term
"Minimum Acquisition Proposal Percentage" included within such definition shall
mean "50%") has been received by Crown or Crown Partnership, and either prior to
the termination of this Agreement or, within twelve (12) months thereafter,
Crown or Crown Partnership enters into any written agreement to consummate a
Qualified Crown Acquisition (each, a "Crown Acquisition Agreement"), which is
subsequently consummated (whether or not any Crown Acquisition Agreement relates
to the same Acquisition Proposal which had been received at the time of the
termination of this Agreement), then Crown and Crown Partnership shall pay the
Break-Up Fee to PREIT Partnership. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Qualified
Crown Acquisition" shall mean any direct or indirect (i) (A) merger,
consolidation, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, (B) sale, acquisition, tender
offer, exchange offer, or share exchange, (C) Transfer of any assets of Crown or
Crown Partnership, or (D) any other transaction that, (ii) in one or a series of
related transactions, will result in (A) the issuance of securities
representing, or the sale, exchange or transfer of, 50% or more of the
outstanding voting equity securities of Crown or outstanding partnership
interests of Crown Partnership (including, without limitation, partnership
interests and units) or (B) the Transfer of 50% or more of the assets of Crown
or Crown Partnership.

                           (b) If this Agreement shall be terminated (i)
pursuant to Section 7.1(j), then PREIT and PREIT Partnership shall pay to Crown
Partnership a fee equal to the Break-Up Fee, or (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(c)
(other than Section 7.1(c)(ii)(y)(B)), Section 7.1(g) (provided that with
respect to Section 7.1(g) the Crown Shareholder Approval shall have been
obtained) or Section 7.1(l), then PREIT and PREIT Partnership shall pay to Crown
Partnership (provided that PREIT was not entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at the time of such termination) an amount equal to
the Break-Up Expenses.

                           (c) Except as set forth in Section 7.4, the payment
of the Break-Up Fee shall be the sole and exclusive compensation for the loss
suffered by PREIT and PREIT Partnership or Crown and Crown Partnership, as the
case may be (the "Break-Up Fee Recipient") (the remaining parties, the "Payor"),
as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated (including, without
limitation, opportunity costs and out-of-pocket costs and expenses) and to avoid
the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances. The Break-Up Fee
shall be paid to the Break-Up Fee Recipient in immediately available funds
within two (2) business days after the date the event giving rise to the
obligation to make such payment occurred, except as otherwise provided in
Sections 7.1(h) and 7.1(j). The Parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.3 are integral parts of this Agreement; accordingly,
if any party fails to promptly pay to the other party the Break-Up Fee or
Break-Up Expenses, as the case may be, due pursuant to this Section 7.3 and, in
order to obtain payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for any amounts owed pursuant to this
Section 7.3, the non-paying party shall pay to the other party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount owed at the rate on six-month
U.S. Treasury obligations in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made plus 300 basis points.

                           (d) As used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Fee" shall
be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $20,000,000 less Break-Up Expenses paid
or payable under this Section 7.3 (the "Base Fee Amount") and (ii) the sum of
(A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Break-Up Fee Recipient, without
causing the Break-Up Fee Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by independent
accountants to the Break-Up Fee Recipient, and (B) in the event the Break-Up Fee
Recipient, receives a letter from outside counsel (the "Break-Up Fee Tax
Opinion") indicating that it has received a ruling from the IRS holding that the
Break-Up Fee Recipient's receipt of the Base Fee Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of the Break-Up Fee
Recipient within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the
"REIT Requirements") or that the receipt by the Break-Up Fee Recipient of the
remaining balance of the Base Fee Amount following the receipt of and pursuant
to such ruling would not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the
Base Fee Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. The Payor's
obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee shall terminate three
years from the date of this Agreement. In the event that Break-Up Fee Recipient
is not able to receive the full Base Fee Amount, the Payor shall place the
unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the
Break-Up Fee Recipient unless and until the Break-Up Fee Recipient receives one
or both of the following: (i) a letter from Break-Up Fee Recipient's independent
accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
Break-Up Fee Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the REIT Requirements
or (ii) a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion, in either of which events Payor shall pay to
Break-Up Fee Recipient the unpaid Base Fee Amount or, if less and either there
is no Break-up Fee Tax Opinion or the ruling described in the Break-Up Fee Tax
Opinion does not hold that the Base Fee Amount either would constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for purposes of the
REIT Requirements, the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i)
above. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, there is no limitation on the number of distributions that
can be made from the escrow prior to the third anniversary of the date of this
Agreement.

                           (e) The "Break-Up Expenses" payable to PREIT
Partnership or Crown Partnership, as the case may be (the "Break-Up Expenses
Recipient"), shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $7,000,000 (to
compensate the Break-Up Expenses Recipient for its costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, transfer taxes paid and reasonable attorneys',
accountants', investment bankers', appraisers' and lenders' fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby) (the "Base Expense Amount"), provided, however, that in the case of any
Break-Up Expenses payable to PREIT Partnership as a result of a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(f) hereof or to Crown Partnership as a result of a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(g) hereof, the Base Expense Amount shall be
reduced to $3,500,000, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be
paid to Break-Up Expenses Recipient, without causing the Break-Up Expenses
Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income, as determined by independent accountants to the Break-Up Expenses
Recipient, and (B) in the event the Break-Up Expenses Recipient, receives a
letter from outside counsel (the "Break-Up Expenses Tax Opinion") indicating
that it has received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Break-Up Expenses
Recipient's receipt of the Base Expense Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of the Break-Up
Expenses Recipient within the meaning of the REIT Requirements or that the
receipt by the Break-Up Expenses Recipient of the remaining balance of the Base
Expense Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would not be
deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Base Expense Amount less the
amount payable under clause (A) above. The Payor's obligation to pay any unpaid
portion of the Break-Up Expense shall terminate three years from the date of
this Agreement. In the event that Break-Up Expenses Recipient is not able to
receive the full Base Expense Amount, the Payor shall place the unpaid amount in
escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the Break-Up Expenses
Recipient unless and until the Break-Up Expenses Recipient receives one or both
of the following: (i) a letter from Salt Break-Up Expenses Recipient's
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to Break-Up Expenses Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion, in either of which events
Payor shall pay to Break-Up Expenses Recipient the unpaid Base Expense Amount
or, if less and either there is no Break-up Expense Tax Opinion or the ruling
described in the Break-Up Expense Tax Opinion does not hold that the Base
Expense Amount either would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from gross income for purposes of the REIT Requirements, the maximum amount
stated in the letter referred to in (i) above. Subject to satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no
limitation on the number of distributions that can be made from the escrow prior
to the third anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

                           (f) The payment of Break-Up Expenses as a result of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to either Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) shall
not in any way limit a party's liability for any breach by such party of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

                  7.4 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Crown or PREIT pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of PREIT, PREIT Partnership, Crown or Crown
Partnership, other than the last sentence of Section 5.2, Section 7.3, this
Section 7.4 and Article 8, and except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to either Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c), in which case nothing in this Agreement
shall in any way limit a party's liability for any breach by such party of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

                  7.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of the respective Board of Trustees of PREIT and Crown at any
time before or after any Shareholder Approvals are obtained and prior to the
filing of the Pennsylvania Articles of Merger with the Department or the
Maryland Articles of Merger with the MSDAT; provided, however, that, after the
Shareholder Approvals and Partner Approvals are obtained, no such amendment,
modification or supplement shall be made which by law requires the further
approval of shareholders or partners without obtaining such further approval.
The parties agree to amend this Agreement in the manner provided in the
immediately preceding sentence to the extent required to (a) continue the status
of each party as a REIT or (b) preserve the Merger as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

                  7.6 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or
in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the
proviso of Section 7.5, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

                  8.3 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the

and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

                  8.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement, the Crown Disclosure Letter, the PREIT Disclosure Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting Agreement, and the other agreements
entered into in connection with the Merger (a) constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b)
except as provided in Section 5.9 ("Third Party Provisions"), are not intended
to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

                  8.8 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section 7.4, the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
federal court located in Pennsylvania or in any state court located in
Pennsylvania this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself (without making such submission exclusive) to the
personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in Pennsylvania or any state
court located in Pennsylvania in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court.

                  8.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms
and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

                  8.10 Exculpation. This Agreement shall not impose any personal
liability on any shareholder, trustee, trust manager, officer, employee or agent
of PREIT, PREIT Partnership, Crown, Crown Partnership, any Crown Subsidiary or
any partner of Crown or Crown Partnership, or any PREIT Subsidiary or any
partner of PREIT or PREIT Partnership, and all Persons shall look solely to the
property of PREIT, PREIT Partnership, Crown or Crown Partnership for the payment
of any claim hereunder or for the performance of this Agreement. Except as
specified pursuant to the Crown Partnership Contribution Agreement or the PREIT
Contribution Agreement, as applicable, none of PREIT, PREIT Partnership or any
of their Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any obligations of Crown
Partnership arising from and after the Effective Time. Except as specified
pursuant to the Crown Partnership Contribution Agreement or the PREIT
Contribution Agreement, as applicable, upon the Effective Time Crown Partnership
shall no longer be responsible for any obligations of Crown, Crown Partnership
or any of their Subsidiaries arising prior to the Effective Time.

                  8.11 Joint and Several Obligations. Prior to the Effective
Time, in each case where both Crown and Crown Partnership, on the one hand, or
PREIT and PREIT Partnership, on the other hand, are obligated to perform the
same obligation hereunder, such obligation shall be joint and several.
