      rate plus 600 basis points.

            (d) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay Holdings (i) the Sixty

<PAGE>

            (e) With each invoice submitted by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to
      Section 2.2(b) through (d), Sellers shall submit the applicable supporting
      documentation set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto, unless otherwise
      agreed by the parties. With respect to the invoice submitted pursuant to
      Section 2.2(a), Sellers shall submit such supporting documentation within
      twenty (20) days of Signing. Buyer may, upon reasonable advance notice to
      Sellers and during Sellers' usual business hours, examine or have Buyer's
      independent public accountants examine Sellers' books and records related
      to any invoice delivered pursuant to Section 2.2 and Section 2.4. Buyer
      may, in good faith, dispute amounts invoiced under Section 2.2 and Section
      2.4 by paying such invoice and thereafter raising the dispute after the
      Closing Date and within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing
      Date or, in the case of invoices provided pursuant to the third or fourth
      sentence of Section 2.2(d), the receipt of such invoice. In the event that
      Buyer disputes any invoiced amount, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing
      that Buyer disputes the accuracy or appropriateness of such invoiced
      amount and specify the particular respects by balance sheet line item in
      which Buyer believes that such invoiced amount is inaccurate or
      inappropriate. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
      such dispute and shall exchange any documentation reasonably required to
      assist in such resolution.

            If Sellers agree with Buyer that the results of Buyer's review of
      such invoices properly indicates that that Buyer has been overcharged (net
      of any undercharges disclosed by such examination), Sellers shall pay
      Buyer the amount of the net overcharge, plus interest at the Interest Rate
      between the date of payment and thirty (30) days prior to the date of
      payment of the overcharge. In the event Sellers do not agree with Buyer's
      calculation, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
      dispute and shall exchange any documentation reasonably required to assist
      in such resolution. In the event that the parties cannot agree on the
      proper amount of the disputed calculation, the parties agree to select a
      mutually acceptable firm of nationally recognized independent public
      accountants to determine disputed amounts. If the parties cannot agree on
      an acceptable firm, each party shall submit the name of its independent
      public accountant, who shall mutually select the nationally recognized
      independent public accountants to resolve the dispute. (The firm chosen by
      the parties or their representatives to resolve the dispute shall be
      referred to herein as the "Accountants"). The parties agree to submit
      disputed items to the Accountants, pursuant to procedures established by
      the Accountants, whose determination shall be binding on the parties. In
      the event that the amount in the aggregate invoiced to Buyer exceeds by
      ten percent (10%) or more the amount owed to Sellers in the aggregate, as
      finally determined by the Accountant, the Sellers shall bear the cost of
      the review and determination by the Accountant. In all other cases, Buyer
      shall bear such costs.

            2.3 TRANSFER TAXES.

            All sales tax and assignment or transfer fees and taxes (exclusive
of federal or state taxes on or measured by income) payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid one-half by Sellers and
one-half by Buyer.

            2.4. ADDITIONAL COSTS.

            If the Closing occurs after manufacture of commercial Enbrel at the
Facility has begun, and Greenwich or a Seller has incurred costs associated with
such manufacture prior to the Closing, and such costs cannot, in Sellers'
opinion, be included within the book value of the Net Assets payable by Buyer
hereunder in accordance with GAAP, such costs shall nevertheless be deemed to be
included within Net Assets payable by Buyer in accordance with the terms hereof.
Buyer shall have the dispute and audit rights set forth in Section 2.2(e) with
respect to any such costs.

            (a) Section 4.7 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Real Property
      and includes a legal description thereof. Greenwich represents and
      warrants that it (1) has fee simple title to the Real Property and (2) has
      good title to all of the Personal Property, in the case of clauses (1) and
      (2), free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for the following, which
      are referred to collectively as "Permitted Encumbrances":

                  (i) Encumbrances set forth in Section 4.7(a) of the Disclosure
            Schedule;

                  (ii) Encumbrances of record;

                  (iii) Encumbrances related to the Phase B construction project
            or otherwise caused by Buyer;


                                       15

<PAGE>

                  (iv) Encumbrances for taxes, assessments or governmental
            charges (including, without limitation, any assessments relating to
            the Real Property), or mechanics', workmen's, materialmen's or
            similar liens, in each case that are (A) not delinquent or (B) which
            are being contested in good faith and are listed on Section
            4.7(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule.

                  (v) Encumbrances that are reflected in the following: Title
            Policy No. 5312-669278 dated September 27, 1999 issued by Fidelity
            National Title Insurance Company of New York; and

                  (vi) Encumbrances that an accurate survey of the Real Property
            would disclose; provided, however, that any such Encumbrance
            described in this clause (vi) shall not constitute a Permitted
            Encumbrance if (x) such Encumbrance is not shown or disclosed on
            that survey of the Real Property entitled "Plan of Land in West
            Greenwich and Coventry Rhode Island surveyed for American Home
            Products Corporation by Marrier Surveying Inc. August 1999" and (y)
            such Encumbrance has or would reasonably be expected to have, a
            Material Adverse Effect.

                  Greenwich has no leasehold interest in any real property
            related to the Facility nor has Greenwich leased (as lessor) or
            pledged all or any part of the Assets, except in connection with the
            Phase B Ground Lease, License and Indemnity Agreement, Easement
            Agreement and the EDC Ground Lease.

            (b) The Real Property contains approximately seventy-three (73)
      acres and the Facility on the Real Property contains a total of at least
      two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of floor area. To Sellers'
      knowledge, except as shown in a survey referred to in Section (a) above,
      all buildings, structures and other material improvements, including, but
      not limited to, any driveways, garages, parking areas and stalls, fences,
      overhangs, storage, docking and loading areas, landscaped areas and sewer
      systems, and all means of access to the Real Property are located
      completely within the boundary lines of the Real Property and do not
      encroach upon or under the property of any other Person in any material
      respect. Except as disclosed in Section 4.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule,
      no improvements constructed on the property of any other Person encroaches
      upon or under the Real Property in a manner that would be reasonably
      likely to cause a Material Adverse Effect. To Sellers' knowledge, except
      as shown on the survey referred to in Section 4.7(a) above, there is no
      other Person or any property of any other Person that encroaches upon the
      Real Property such that any such encroachments, either alone or in the
      aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
      The Real Property abuts a public way or a private way to which the Buyer
      shall have both pedestrian and vehicular access and such private way is
      duly laid out or accepted as such by the city or town in which the Real
      Property is located.

            (c) Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
      Buyer, by purchasing the Shares, will have acquired fee simple title to
      the Real Property, the Personal Property, and all other Assets owned by
      Greenwich free and clear of all


                                       16

<PAGE>

      Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances (and other than
      Encumbrances or other defects in title attributable to facts or
      circumstances related to, or actions taken by, Buyer).

            4.8. CONDITION OF PHYSICAL ASSETS; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

            (a) Except as disclosed in Section 4.8 of the Disclosure Schedule,
      to Sellers' knowledge, the buildings, structures, and improvements on the
      Real Property (including the Facility) and the Personal Property (in the
      aggregate) are in good working order, normal wear and tear excepted,
      taking into account that the Facility remains under construction and no
      representation is being given as to the operational effectiveness of the
      Facility. No costs referred to in Section 2.4 have been incurred to date,
      and assuming a Closing of January 3, 2001, no such costs are reasonably
      foreseeable prior to Closing.

            (b) Greenwich does not own any registered trademarks, tradenames,
      copyrights or patents, nor does a Seller own any such intellectual
      property rights primarily related to the Assets.

            4.9. EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) Section 4.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule
      sets forth the name, title and present salary of each present employee of
      Greenwich listed on the payroll for the Facility as of the date hereof
      ("Facility Employees"). Except as set forth in Section 4.9(a) of the
      Disclosure Schedule, neither Greenwich nor Sellers are a party to or bound
      by any collective bargaining or other labor agreement with respect to the
      Facility Employees, and there are no labor unions or other organizations
      representing or, to the knowledge of the Sellers, purporting to represent
      or attempting to represent, any Facility Employees.

            (b) Neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates are currently
      required to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, nor have they been
      assessed liability for any Multiemployer Plan. The Sellers are not subject
      to and do no reasonably expect to incur any withdrawal liability under
      Title IV of ERISA which Sellers or their Affiliates will not be able to
      satisfy.

            (c) Sellers maintain the Sellers' Savings Plan which is intended to
      be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (and the trust related
      thereto) and such Plan is intended to be tax exempt under Section 501(a)
      of the Code. The Sellers' Savings Plan has a favorable determination
      letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering the Tax Reform Act of
      1986 and, to the knowledge of Sellers, such letter has not been revoked
      nor has such Plan been amended in any respect or any actions taken or
      operational defects occurred since the receipt of such letter which would
      result in the disqualification of Sellers' Savings Plan by the Internal
      Revenue Service.

            (d) Except for any routine contributions owed by Greenwich on behalf
      of the Transferred Employees to one or more of Sellers' Employee Benefit
      Plans for a period preceding the Closing Date, and except as set forth in
      Article VIII, Buyer shall not incur any liability with respect to the
      Sellers' Employee Benefit Plans as a result of (i) the


                                       17

<PAGE>

      Transferred Employees' cessation of participation in such Sellers'
      Employee Benefit Plans on the Closing Date, (ii) any claims under such
      Sellers' Employee Benefit Plans arising on, prior to, or after the Closing
      Date, (iii) any failure by the Sellers, Greenwich, any ERISA Affiliate of
      a Seller or Greenwich, or any third party to comply with any provision of
      ERISA or the Code or any other Applicable Law; or (iv) the imposition of
      any term under a Sellers' Employee Benefit Plan which is triggered by the
      consummation of the transactions described in this Agreement.

            4.10. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Except as disclosed in Section 4.10 of
the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto, (a) the operation of the Facility is
being conducted in compliance with, and the Real Property and all Assets comply
with all Applicable Laws, as of the date hereof, except for violations, if any,
which singly or in the aggregate have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, (b) to the knowledge of Sellers,
the operation of the Facility has been conducted in compliance with, and the
Real Property and all Assets have complied with, all Applicable Laws, from
September 24, 1999 up to the date hereof, except for violations, if any, which
singly or in the aggregate have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Section 4.10 of the
Disclosure Schedule, all Applicable Permits required in connection with the
operation of the Facility as currently operated, have been obtained and are in
full force and effect and are being complied with in all material respects,
except for such failures which singly or in the aggregate have not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

            4.11. CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS. (a) Section 4.11(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule attached hereto sets forth a complete and accurate list of
each contract, agreement, understanding, arrangement or commitment relating to
the Facility or the Assets outstanding as of the date hereof to which Sellers or
Greenwich is a party and which:

                  (i) imposes a right of first refusal, option or other
      restriction with respect to any Asset; or

                  (ii) is or contains a lease, license (other than software,
      shrinkwrap licenses), joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
      similar contract or arrangement, or confidentiality agreement;

                  (iii) is or contains a non-competition agreement or other
      agreement which limits the freedom of Sellers or Greenwich to own,
      operate, sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any
      Asset or that would bind any other assets of Buyer now or in the future;

                  (iv) is a contract involving more than $100,000 in payments or
      receipts annually, except for purchase orders entered into in connection
      with the construction of the Facility or entered into in the ordinary
      course of business; or

                  (v) is a contract that guarantees any indebtedness of any
      other Person in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate.


                                       18

<PAGE>

The contracts, agreements, understandings, arrangements, and commitments set
forth on Section 4.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Material Contracts".

            (b) Each Material Contract is a valid and binding agreement of
Sellers or Greenwich, as the case may be. There is no material default by the
Sellers or Greenwich or, to the knowledge of the Sellers, by any third party,
under any Material Contract. A true and complete copy of each Material Contract
will be made available to Buyer and as of the Closing will have been made
available to Buyer.

            4.12. BROKERS AND INTERMEDIARIES. Neither the Sellers nor their
Affiliates or any of them has employed or dealt with any broker or finder in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would be
entitled to a broker's or finder's, or similar fee or commission in connection
therewith or upon the consummation thereof.

            4.13. LICENSES AND PERMITS. Section 4.13 of the Disclosure Schedule
attached hereto correctly describes each material Applicable Permit, together
with the name of the Governmental Authority issuing such license or permit (the
"Material Permits"). Except as set forth in Section 4.13 of the Disclosure
Schedule, to Sellers' knowledge, such Material Permits are valid and in full
force and effect.

            4.14. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

            To the knowledge of Sellers, each of the representations and
warranties set forth in subsections (a) through (e) of this Section 4.14 is true
and correct with respect to the Assets, except to the extent that the facts and
circumstances giving rise to any such failure to be so true and correct would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.14(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, no Hazardous Materials are present in, on, or under the Real Property,
including, without limitation, the soil and groundwater thereunder;

            (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.14(b) of the Disclosure

material respects with all Environmental Laws, and all governmental approvals,

Property and all operations and facilities of the Real Property as operated
since September 24, 1999 have been obtained and are in full force and effect and
are being complied with in all material respects;

            (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.14 (c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Sellers, Greenwich nor any of their Affiliates have
received any written governmental complaint, notice of violation, alleged
violation, or investigation or notice of potential liability or of potential
responsibility regarding environmental protection matters or permit compliance
with regard to the Real Property which either singly or in the aggregate would
constitute a Material Adverse Effect;


                                       19

<PAGE>

            (d) Except as set forth in Section 4.14(d) of the Disclosure

administrative actions or judicial proceedings pending or threatened under any
Environmental Laws to which the Sellers or Greenwich are named or to be named as
a party with respect to the Real Property or any Hazardous Materials transferred
from the Real Property, nor have there been any consent decrees or other
decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or other orders, under any
Environmental Law with respect to any of the Real Property.

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Section 4.14
and Section 4.5 hereof shall be the exclusive representation and warranty of
Sellers under this Agreement relating to environmental matters.

            4.15. TAXES.

            (a) On or prior to the date hereof, Sellers and Greenwich have
      properly completed and filed on a timely basis and in the correct form all
      Returns with respect to Greenwich or the Assets required to be filed on or
      prior to the date hereof (taking into account any extensions) that a
      reasonable person would deem material. As of the time of filing, the
      foregoing Returns correctly reflected, in all respects that a reasonable
      person would deem material, the facts regarding income, business, assets,
      operations, activities, status or other matters therein or any other
      information required to be shown thereon. In particular, and without in
      any manner limiting the foregoing, none of the foregoing Returns contains
      any position which is or would subject Greenwich, a Seller, or Buyer to
      penalties under section 6662 of the Code (or any corresponding provision
      of state, local or foreign tax law).

            (b) With respect to all amounts in respect of Taxes imposed upon
      Greenwich, or for which Sellers or Greenwich are or could be liable

      thereof) ending on or before the Signing or the Closing Date, as
      applicable, all material applicable tax laws and agreements have been
      fully complied with, and all such amounts required to be paid to taxing
      authorities or others on or before the date hereof have been fully and
      timely paid.

            (c) Except as set forth on Section 4.15(c) of the Disclosure
      Schedule, (i) other than with respect to Returns for which AHP files on a
      consolidated, combined or unitary basis, no issues have been raised (and
      are currently pending) by any taxing authority in connection with any
      Returns of Greenwich or Sellers related to the Assets, (ii) other than
      with respect to Returns for which AHP files on a consolidated, combined or
      unitary basis, no extensions or waivers of statutes of limitation with
      respect to any Returns of Greenwich or Sellers related to the Assets have
      been given by or requested by Greenwich


                                       20

<PAGE>

      or Sellers, and (iii) there are no liens for Taxes (other than Permitted
      Encumbrances) upon the Assets.

            4.16. DISCLAIMER. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OR OTHERWISE IN REGARD
TO THE ASSETS.

            4.17. DISCLOSURE IN SCHEDULES. Any disclosure contained in any
section of the Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall, should the
disclosure be relevant to any other section of the Disclosure Schedule to this
Agreement, be deemed to be disclosed with respect to that other Schedule to the
Agreement where such disclosure and its significance would be reasonably obvious
to the party to whom the disclosure is made. Certain information set forth in
the Schedules is included solely for informational purposes and may not be
required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The disclosure of any
information shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such
information is required to be disclosed in connection with the representations

the Signing (that Sellers do not have actual knowledge of) that there is a
material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Sellers contained
herein and Buyer shall disclose to Sellers any such findings between Signing and
Closing (that Sellers do not have actual knowledge of). Provided that Buyer has
not breached the representation and warranty set forth above in this Section

            debt securities or guarantee the payment obligations for borrowed
            money of any third party Person,;

                  (x) take any action, other than reasonable and usual actions

                  (xi) make any Tax election or settle or compromise any Tax
            liability;

                  (xii) enter into any contract not related to the Project or

            course of business and consistent with past practice;

                  (xiii) authorize any single capital expenditure by Greenwich
            not related to the Project or the Facility which is in excess of one
            hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or capital expenditures not
            related to the Project or the Facility which are, in the aggregate,
            in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000);

                  (xiv) agree to do any of the foregoing in this Section 6.1(c).

            6.2. PERMITTED ACTIONS.

            (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers,
      together with their respective Affiliates, shall retrofit Suite A of the
      Facility to accommodate the commercial manufacture of Enbrel, to perform
      the initial validation runs for Enbrel and to commence commercial
      production of Enbrel. Further, the parties have determined that, in lieu
      of building out Suite A-3, they will undertake the "Greenwich Project",
      pursuant to which Greenwich shall construct the administration building
      and parking facility planned to be located on the Real Property. (The
      retrofit of Suite A and the Greenwich Project are hereinafter collectively
      referred to as the "Project".) The Project shall be


                                       24

<PAGE>

      overseen by a Steering Committee, whose objective is to recognize and
      utilize the strengths and competencies of each party to perform the
      Project. All costs incurred by Sellers or Greenwich in performing their
      obligations under this Section 6.2(a) shall be reflected in the book value
      of the Net Assets even if not appropriate under GAAP to be included
      because such Greenwich Project is discontinued at the direction of the
      Steering Committee or the Buyer.

            (b) If not formed before the Signing, a Steering Committee shall be
      formed following the date hereof, which shall have six (6) members, with
      Buyer and Sellers each having the right to appoint three (3) members (the
      "Steering Committee"). The Steering Committee shall oversee the Project
      through the Closing Date and shall have the following powers and duties:

                  (i)   The Steering Committee shall approve an annual budget
                        for the Facility, including a capital budget;

                  (ii)  the Steering Committee shall approve in advance any
                        capital expenditures by any third party or by Sellers
                        associated with the fill and finish of bulk drug
                        substance Enbrel manufactured at the Facility;

                  (iii) the Steering Committee shall meet on at least a
                        quarterly basis or more frequently as necessary, and
                        decisions of the Steering Committee shall be made by
                        consensus. The Steering Committee shall endeavor to
                        reach a consensus on all matters within its authority
                        which are in dispute within a period of ten (10) days
                        after receiving notification from either Buyer or
                        Sellers that such dispute has been referred to the
                        Steering Committee for resolution. If such a resolution
                        cannot be reached in that time period (or earlier at the
                        election of either party), the matter shall be referred
                        to the Chief Operating Officer of Buyer and the
                        President of AHP's Wyeth-Ayerst Division, or their
                        designees, for resolution in a period of ten (10) days
                        (or such other time period agreed by the parties)
                        through good faith discussions, or if still unresolved,
                        the parties shall endeavor in good faith to promptly
                        agree upon a binding third party dispute resolution
                        mechanism intended promptly and fairly to resolve the
                        matter in dispute.

                  (iv)  The Steering Committee shall be disbanded upon the
                        Closing Date.

            (c) Sellers shall be permitted to cause Greenwich to transfer to
      Holdings by way of a distribution or otherwise all cash and cash
      equivalents held by Greenwich from time to time up to and including the
      Closing Date. In the event all such cash or cash equivalents are not
      transferred to Sellers at Closing, Sellers shall include such cash or cash
      equivalents in the invoice to be provided by Sellers to Buyer as soon as
      practicable


                                       25

<PAGE>

      after the Closing, pursuant to Section 2.2(c) of this Agreement.

            (d) Buyer may perform or have performed a construction cost audit of
      the Project. Sellers shall pay the costs of any such audit that occurs
      prior to Closing and include such cost in the book value of the Net Assets
      whether or not appropriate under GAAP to be included.

            (e) Buyer may perform or have performed a cost segregation analysis
      and state tax analysis of the Project. Sellers shall pay the costs of any
      such analyses that occur prior to Closing and include such costs in the
      book value of the Net Assets.

            (f) Buyer may take actions prior to Closing in order to facilitate
      the smooth transition of ownership and operation of Greenwich Holdings to
      Buyer. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, hiring of support
      and administrative staff and implementation of systems and processes
      consistent with those of Buyer. Any costs of such actions that are
      incurred by Sellers prior to Closing shall be included in the book value
      of the Net Assets whether or not appropriate under GAAP to be included.

            6.3. ACCOUNTING RECORDS.

            The accounting records supporting all expenditures of Greenwich
shall include a classification of expenditures into the following categories:

            (a) Construction and make-ready Costs; (such costs shall further be
      supported by detailed listing of individual assets and related costs);

            (b) Facility testing costs (including all costs to test and validate
      the manufacturing processes and systems including the costs of performing
      the test production runs);

            (c) FDA filing costs (including all costs of preparing and filing
      the facility license application with the FDA);

            (d) FDA conformance runs (the cost of producing the lots of Enbrel
      that will be used to support the FDA filing);

            (e) Catalytica Facility validation costs; and

            (f) Start-up and operating costs (all costs incurred following
      completion of the FDA conformance runs).

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

            7.1. ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS.

            Simultaneous with the Signing, AHP and Buyer will enter into the
Collaboration Agreement, the Technology Transfer Agreement, [*]. Between Signing
and Closing, it is anticipated that a Seller and Buyer will enter into a
transition services agreement for certain services related to the operation of
the Facility.

            7.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY.

            (a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing
      through the Closing Date and, provided that the Closing occurs, for a
      period of at least six (6) years after the Closing Date or, with respect
      to any Taxes, the applicable statute of limitations, with respect to books
      and records reasonably deemed by Sellers to be necessary in connection
      with (i) the preparation or examination of Tax Returns, (ii) the Excluded
      Assets and Liabilities, and (iii) financial reporting, Buyer shall afford
      to the Sellers and to Sellers' accountants, counsel, and other
      representatives, reasonable access to all of the Assets, books, Contracts,
      commitments, records, facilities, technical and personnel information,
      and, during such period, shall furnish reasonably promptly to Sellers all
      documents and information concerning the Assets and Transferred Employees
      as Sellers may reasonably request; provided that the above activities do
      not interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Buyer and
      provided further that Buyer shall not be required to disclose any
      documents or information related to Transferred Employees that would
      violate any Applicable Law.

            (b) Any information that Buyer discloses to Sellers, or to which
      Sellers have access, as a result of Section 7.2(a) above shall be deemed
      "Buyer Confidential Information" if such information (i) is designated as
      "Confidential" in writing at the time of any written disclosure or (ii)
      even if not so identified as "Confidential", would reasonably be
      identified or understood by Sellers as the confidential or proprietary
      information of Buyer. Buyer Confidential Information shall not, however,
      include:

            (1) information which was already known by the Sellers at the time
            of its disclosure hereunder, as evidenced by Sellers' written
            records;

            (2) information disclosed to Sellers by a third party lawfully in
            possession of such information and not under an obligation of
            nondisclosure to Buyer in respect thereof;

* Confidential Treatment Requested.


                                       27

<PAGE>

            (3) information which at the time of disclosure is or subsequently
            becomes patented, published or otherwise part of the public domain,
            except by breach of this Agreement by Sellers;

            (4) information developed by Sellers independently of information
            obtained from Buyer; or

            (5) information which is required to be disclosed by law, regulation
            or the order of a judicial or administrative authority; provided,
            however, that Sellers (A) give Buyer prompt written notice prior to
            disclosure by Sellers to permit Buyer to seek a protective order or
            other similar order with respect to Buyer Confidential Information,
            and (B) thereafter disclose only the minimum Buyer Confidential
            Information required to be disclosed in order to comply, whether or
            not a protective order or other similar order is obtained by Buyer.

      Unless Sellers have obtained Buyer's prior written consent, Sellers shall
      hold confidential all Buyer Confidential Information, shall not disclose
      it to any third party, and shall use it only for purposes consistent with
      this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 7.2(b) shall survive the
      expiration or termination of this Agreement or the Closing, whichever
      occurs first, for a period of four (4) years from the each such disclosure
      of Confidential Information; provided, however, that with respect to Buyer
      Confidential Information related to the Facility Employees, the provisions
      of this Section 7.2(b) shall survive indefinitely; and provided further
      that this Agreement shall not be deemed to alter any prior confidentiality
      obligations among the parties, including those related to Enbrel or the
      manufacture thereof.

            (c) During the period commencing on the Signing and continuing
      through the Closing Date, Sellers (i) will give and will cause Greenwich
      to give to Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
      authorized representatives reasonable access to all of the offices,
      properties, books, records, Contracts, commitments, facilities, technical
      information, and personnel of Sellers or Greenwich relating to the Assets,
      (ii) will permit and facilitate any reasonable interview process for
      potential continued employment of the Facility Employees with Buyer, and
      (iii) will give and will cause Greenwich to give to Buyer reasonable
      access to Greenwich's engineering and other Facility Employees to provide
      planning and technical assistance related to Buyer's intended use of the
      Assets after the Closing as Buyer may reasonably request.

            7.3 REGULATORY FILINGS.

            Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other party hereto
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions to any Governmental Authority. Buyer and Sellers each agree to file
any information required by the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof and each agrees promptly to supplement such information and
promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to effect compliance with the
conditions specified


                                       28

<PAGE>

in Article 9 hereof and shall cooperate with one another to furnish promptly to
Governmental Authorities any additional information reasonably requested by them
in connection with such filings. Neither party shall be required, however, to
divest or outlicense products or assets or change its business or intended use
of the Facility if doing so is a condition of obtaining approval under the HSR
Act or other governmental approvals of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the parties shall use commercially reasonable good faith
efforts to eliminate any concerns on the part of federal or state antitrust
authorities, including, without limitation, cooperating in good faith with any
government investigation, including prompt production of documents and
information demanded by a second request for documents and of witnesses if
requested. Each party will consult and cooperate with the other party and will
consider in good faith the view of the other party in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, opinion or proposal made
or submitted in connection with any action, request or investigation under or
relating to the HSR Act or any other national, federal or state antitrust,
competition or fair trade law.

            7.4 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS.

            Each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the conditions of the Closing,
including, without limitation, the execution and delivery of all agreements
contemplated hereunder to be so executed and delivered.

            (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

            (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

            (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to the best of the notifying party's knowledge threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Sellers, Buyer, the Shares or
the Assets that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed hereunder or that relate to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            7.6 START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE FACILITY.

            During the period of Sellers' ownership of the Shares, and
thereafter for such transition period as may be agreed to by the parties (which
period shall not be longer than the period set forth in the Technology Transfer
Agreement), a reasonable number of Buyer and Sellers and Sellers' Affiliates
personnel shall be involved in all aspects of start-up and operation


                                       29

<PAGE>

of the Facility as are agreed by the parties, and shall also have access to all
engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance, quality control, regulatory, and
all other documentation related to the Facility and the Enbrel product(s)
manufactured at the Facility to facilitate Sellers' and its Affiliates'
knowledge and understanding of manufacturing commercial quantities of Enbrel;
provided, however, that the above activities do not interfere unreasonably with
the business of Buyer, and provided further that, during the term of either
party's ownership of the Shares, and consistent with the terms hereunder, such
party will have ultimate decision making authority with respect to day-to-day
operations of the Facility.

            7.7 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTS.

            Sellers shall allow Buyer to (a) review and approve each contract
entered into after the Signing involving capital improvements to the Facility
which would reasonably be expected to result in payments by or on behalf of
Sellers or Greenwich greater than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) in the
aggregate, (b) review and consult with Sellers on all contracts involving the
Facility and its operation of duration greater than one (1) year which would
reasonably be expected to require payments by or on behalf of Sellers or
Greenwich in an amount greater than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000) in the aggregate under such contract and (c) review and approve each
contract involving the fill and finish of Enbrel produced at the Facility. Buyer
shall be a party to each such contract under clause (c) of this Section 7.7, and
to the extent practicable, Sellers shall name or shall cause Greenwich to name
Buyer a third party beneficiary under each such contract under clauses (a) and
(b) of this Section 7.7.

            7.8 BUYER PERSONNEL COSTS.

Sellers and Buyers shall enter into the respective [*]. Between the Signing and
the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers shall consult with each other in good faith
on all hires at or relating to the Facility for the position of manager and
above and for key technical positions. Neither Sellers nor Greenwich shall hire
any such prospective employee whose titles are Manager or above who is likely to
become a Transferred Employee if Buyer has a good faith reasonable objection to
such employee that does not violate any Applicable Law.

            7.10 FACILITY USE.

            Buyer will have complete access to the Facility through the Closing
Date, subject to standard safety and security procedures, to facilitate Buyer's
participation in the Project. As

<PAGE>

between the parties, Buyer shall have the final authority with respect to
decisions related to Phase B, including general timelines relating thereto, and
with respect to conceptual design, basic engineering and detailed engineering.
Such general timelines for Phase B shall be conducted in a manner which does not
materially impact the schedule for the retrofit of Suite A.

            7.11 TRANSFER OF SELLER EMPLOYEES.

            Buyer acknowledges that as of the Signing, there are approximately
[*] of Sellers or their Affiliates working at the Facility. Such employees are
not deemed to be Facility Employees, and will not be deemed to be Transferred
Employees at the Closing. Notwithstanding the proceeding sentence, the parties
agree that coincident with, or prior to Closing, Sellers may transfer the number
of persons (having the job titles indicated) preliminarily set forth in Section
7.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (which such Disclosure Schedule may be
updated until Closing) from the Facility to one or more of Sellers'
biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities to ensure their successful
construction, start-up and operation (collectively, the "Sellers Employees").
The total number of Seller Employees shall not, under any circumstances, exceed
[*] percent ([*]%) of the total number of Facility Employees at the time of the
Signing. Sellers shall, not later than the Closing, provide Buyer written notice
of each such Seller Employee, and in all cases, shall give Buyer at least [*]
months' written notice of the transfer of each Seller Employee, in order to
allow Buyer sufficient time to recruit and to train replacement personnel at the
Facility; provided, however, that upon Buyer's written consent, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, such written notice period may be shortened.

            Seller Employees shall not become Transferred Employees pursuant to
Section 8.1(a) hereof, but shall remain or become employees of one of the
Sellers or their Affiliates. Seller Employees shall remain on the payroll of
Sellers and be covered by Sellers' Employee Benefit Plans and insurance
coverage, including workers compensation, after the Closing. Seller Employees
shall remain employed at the Facility until the earlier of the date Seller
Employees are no longer needed upon mutual agreement between Buyer and Seller,
or the end of the written notice period. If any Seller Employees are performing
activities or services at the Facility that contribute to the operation of the
Facility or the manufacture of Enbrel at the Facility, Buyer shall reimburse
Seller for the full allocated costs associated with the Seller Employees after
the Closing Date [*].

            7.12 ASSIGNMENT OF BUYER EMPLOYEES

                  [*]. In addition, prior to Closing, Buyer may assign one or
more of its employees to the Facility to ensure the successful transition of the
business. Buyer may also, after being notified by Sellers of the identity of
Seller Employees in Section 7.11, hire replacement workers. Buyer's employees
assigned to work at the Facility, and replacement workers Buyer hires to work
with Seller Employees prior to Closing (collectively "Buyer

                                       31

<PAGE>

Transition Employees") shall remain on or be assigned to the payroll of Buyer
and shall not be covered by Sellers' Employee Benefit Plans and insurance
coverage, including workers compensation. If any Buyer Transition Employees are
performing activities or services at the Facility that contribute to the
operation of the Facility or the manufacture of Enbrel at the Facility, Sellers
shall reimburse Buyer for the full allocated costs associated with the Buyer
Transition Employees prior to the Closing Date [*].

            7.13 TRANSFER OF PERMITS; CONTRACTS .

            Before and, to the extent necessary after, the Closing, Sellers
shall use, and shall cause Greenwich to use, commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Buyer (without any obligation to make any payment of consideration) in
effectuating transfer or reissuance of Applicable Permits required for operation
of the Facility under any Environmental Laws or other Applicable Laws and
Sellers shall use, and shall cause Greenwich to use, commercially reasonable
efforts (without any obligation to make any payment of consideration) to obtain
any necessary consents to assignment of the Contracts from Sellers or Greenwich
to Buyer.

            7.14 TAX MATTERS

            (a) AHP shall have the exclusive authority and obligation to prepare
      and execute on behalf of Greenwich and timely file all Returns with

      prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall have the exclusive authority and
      obligation to prepare and timely file all Returns with respect to
      Greenwich or the Assets for all other taxable periods.

            (b) AHP shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes
      imposed on or with respect to Greenwich or the Assets for all taxable
      periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including without
      limitation (a) any federal income Tax liability imposed on Sellers or
      Greenwich resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election, as defined in
      Section 7.14(e)(i) below, and (b) any state, local, or foreign tax imposed
      on Sellers or Greenwich attributable to an election under the state, local
      or foreign law similar to the election available under Section 338(h)(10)
      of the Code; provided, however, that if a state, local or foreign
      jurisdiction does not have provisions similar to the election available
      under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, Sellers shall be liable for any Tax
      based on income imposed on Sellers by such state, local and/or foreign
      jurisdiction resulting from the transaction contemplated by this
      Agreement. Buyer shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes
      imposed on or with respect to Greenwich or the Assets for all other
      taxable periods, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth
      herein. With respect to any taxable period beginning before and ending
      after the Closing Date (an "Overlap Period"), Taxes shall be apportioned
      between Sellers and Buyer as follows: (x) in the case of Taxes other than
      income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, on a per

* Confidential Treatment Requested.


                                       32

      diem basis; and (y) in the case of income, sales and use and withholding
      Taxes, as determined as though the taxable period ended on the Closing
      Date. The parties agree to consult in good faith regarding the calculation
      of such Taxes and apportionment.

            (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.14(c), AHP shall
      have the exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any
      taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Return, and
      contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes,
      notice of tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes ("Tax
      Controversies") with respect to Greenwich or the Assets for any taxable
      period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall have the
      exclusive authority over Tax Controversies with respect to Greenwich or
      the Assets for all other taxable periods and Tax Controversies which (x)
      arise after the Closing Date and (y) relate to Taxes for which Buyer has
      paid Sellers under Article 2 hereof as Net Assets or otherwise..
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Overlap Period and with
      respect to any Tax Controversies that could possibly affect the Tax
      liability of both (a) Buyer or its Affiliates and (b) one or more Sellers
      or their Affiliates):

                  (i)   no party shall, without the prior written consent of the
                        other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably
                        withheld or delayed, enter into any settlement of any
                        contest or otherwise compromise any issue that affects
                        or may affect the Tax liability of the other parties or
                        any of their Affiliates;

                  (ii)  with respect to any Overlap Period, any additional Taxes
                        determined to be payable and any refund of Taxes shall
                        be apportioned as provided in Section 7.14(b) hereof;
                        and

                  (iii) the parties agree to consult in good faith regarding any
                        Tax Controversies with respect to Greenwich or the
                        Assets, including to provide each other draft copies of
                        proposed audit adjustments and other documents with
                        respect to Tax Controversies for review and comment.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
      Section 7.14, Buyer shall be liable for all Taxes (including Taxes arising
      from Tax Controversies) other than Income Taxes, which constitute either
      Facility Costs or amounts of Net Assets and shall pay such Taxes to the
      appropriate taxing authorities or to Sellers in accordance with the
      provisions of Sections 2.2 or 11.2 hereof, as the case may be.

            (e) Section 338(h)(10) election.

                  (i)   Sellers represent that they filed a consolidated income
                        tax return with Greenwich for the taxable year
                        immediately preceding the current taxable year and that
                        Sellers are eligible to make an election under section
                        338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable

                        election under state, local or foreign law) (the
                        "338(h)(10) Election") with respect to Greenwich.

                  (ii)  Buyer and Sellers shall jointly make an election under
                        section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable
                        election under state, local or foreign tax law) with
                        respect to the acquisition of Greenwich by Buyer. Buyer
                        and Sellers shall cooperate fully with each other in the
                        making of such election. Not withstanding any language
                        contained in this Agreement, Sellers and Buyer agree
                        that for Tax purposes, all monies or consideration paid
                        under this Agreement by Buyer are for the express
                        purpose of purchasing the Shares.

                  (iii) Buyer shall initially prepare a complete IRS Form 8023
                        (and any comparable forms required to be filed under
                        state, local or foreign tax laws) and any additional
                        data or materials required to be attached to Form 8023
                        pursuant to the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
                        Section 338 of the Code (the "Section 338 Forms"). AHP
                        shall deliver to Buyer, no later than one hundred twenty
                        (120) days prior to the date the Section 338 Forms are
                        required to be filed, such documents and other
                        information as reasonably requested by Buyer to complete
                        the Section 338 Forms. Buyer shall deliver said forms to
                        AHP for review no later than sixty (60) days prior to
                        the date the Section 338 Forms are required to be filed.
                        In the event AHP objects to the manner in which the
                        Section 338 Forms have been prepared, AHP shall notify
                        Buyer within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Section
                        338 Forms of such objection, and the parties shall
                        endeavor within the next fifteen (15) days in good faith
                        to resolve such dispute. If the parties are unable to
                        resolve such dispute within said fifteen (15) day
                        period, Buyer and AHP shall submit such dispute to an
                        independent accounting firm chosen in the manner
                        described in Section 2.2(e) above (the "Allocation
                        Arbiter") selected by Buyer and AHP. Promptly, but not
                        later than fifteen (15) days after its acceptance of
                        appointment hereunder, the Allocation Arbiter will
                        determine (based solely on presentations of Buyer and
                        AHP and not by independent review) only those matters in
                        dispute and will render a written report as to the
                        disputed matters and the resulting preparation of the
                        Section 338 Forms shall be conclusive and binding upon
                        the parties.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                      AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEES

                              AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS

            8.1 BUYER'S OBLIGATIONS TO EMPLOYEES.

            (a) Effective on the Closing Date, Buyer shall be obligated to
      continue the employment of all Facility Employees (except Seller
      Employees) at [*] salary [*] such Facility Employee immediately prior to
      the Closing Date (hereinafter referred to as "Transferred Employees")
      (assuming Seller's compliance with Section 7.2(c)(ii)), subject to Buyer's
      ability to discontinue employment of Transferred Employees pursuant to
      Sections 8.1(h) and (l) below. [*]. All Transferred Employees shall be
      entitled to participate in the benefit plans, programs and arrangements of
      Buyer on the day after the Closing Date as set forth below.

            (b) Buyer maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan on behalf of
      its employees ("Buyer's Tax-Deferred Savings Plan"). Buyer agrees that
      effective immediately after the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly take
      all action necessary to extend coverage under Buyer's Tax-Deferred Savings
      Plan to the Transferred Employees who have satisfied such plan's
      eligibility requirements. Buyer shall credit all service completed by
      Transferred Employees with Greenwich or Sellers, as the case may be, prior
      to the Closing Date for eligibility and vesting purposes under Buyer's
      Tax-Deferred Savings Plan. Sellers shall amend its defined contribution
      401(k) savings plan and nonqualified supplemental savings plan ("Sellers'
      Savings Plans") to provide that Transferred Employees shall be fully
      vested in all employer matching contributions as of the Closing Date.
      Sellers agree and acknowledge that the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated by this Agreement will result in, and constitute, a
      distributable event pursuant to Code Section 401(k)(10)(A)(iii) (the
      "Distributable Event") with respect to Sellers' Savings Plans for all
      Transferred Employees. Buyer's Tax-Deferred Savings Plan shall accept
      elective transfers of distributions of benefits, including notes
      representing participant's loans from Sellers' Savings Plan. Sellers shall
      amend its defined benefit pension plan and non-qualified supplemental
      pension plan ("Sellers' Retirement Plans") to provide that service with
      Buyer after the Closing Date shall continue to be credited under Sellers'
      Retirement Plans for purposes of vesting and eligibility for early
      retirement subsidies but not for benefit accrual purposes. Transferred
      Employees shall not be eligible to commence receipt of retirement benefits
      under Sellers' Retirement Plans until they have satisfied the age and
      service requirements under Sellers' Retirement Plans and terminated
      employment with Buyer or any successor thereto.

            (c) Buyer provides to its employees medical (including prescription
      drugs), dental, vacation, life insurance, accidental death and
      dismemberment, spending account plans, short-term disability and long-term
      disability benefit plans ("Buyer's Welfare Plans") for its employees; [*].
      Immediately after the Closing Date, Transferred Employees shall be
      eligible to participate in such Buyer's Welfare Plans in accordance

* Confidential Treatment Requested.


                                       35

<PAGE>

      with the terms of such plans, and employment with Sellers or any
      predecessor shall be taken into account for purposes of determining
      eligibility for participation and benefits under such Buyer's Welfare
      Plans; provided, however, the Transferred Employees shall participate in
      such Buyer's Welfare Plans that are core plans provided to all Buyer's
      employees (and not optional or supplemental plans) (i) without any waiting
      periods, pre-existing condition restrictions or evidence of insurability
      [*]; and (ii) Buyer shall count claims arising on or prior to the Closing
      Date, during the calendar year of the Closing, for purposes of satisfying
      deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, lifetime maximums, and other similar
      limitations, and (iii) Transferred Employees shall participate in Buyer's
      vacation plan according to the terms set forth in Section 8.1(g) below.
      Prior to the Closing Date, according to a schedule agreed upon by Sellers
      and Buyer, Sellers shall provide Buyer with all of the information
      necessary to facilitate the Transferred Employees' participation in
      Buyer's Welfare Plans on the day after the Closing in accordance with the
      terms of this Agreement, including without limitation information
      regarding claims arising on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers and
      Buyer shall cooperate as necessary after the Closing to ensure that such
      information is complete and updated.

            (d) Sellers maintain a program of medical and life insurance
      benefits for certain retired employees ("Sellers' Retiree Benefit Plans").
      All Transferred Employees who satisfy the eligibility criteria for
      benefits under Sellers' Retiree Benefit Plans on or prior to the Closing
      Date shall be entitled to benefits from Sellers' Retiree Benefit Plans
      following termination from Buyer or any successor thereto or its
      Affiliates, in accordance with the terms of Sellers' Retiree Benefit
      Plans. However, Transferred Employees shall not be eligible to receive
      medical and life insurance benefits under Sellers' Retiree Benefit Plans
      while the Transferred Employees are eligible for coverage under Buyer's
      Welfare Benefit Plans. Transferred Employees shall receive primary
      coverage under Buyer's retiree welfare plans, if Buyer institutes any such
      plans in the future, ("Buyer's Retiree Welfare Plans") upon termination of
      employment if the Transferred Employees are eligible for coverage under
      Buyer's Retiree Welfare Plans, with Sellers' Retiree Welfare Plans being
      responsible for secondary coverage. Transferred Employees shall
      participate in Buyer's Retiree Welfare Plans, if any, in accordance with
      the terms of such plans (but only to the extent Transferred Employees
      elect to participate therein) and Buyer shall recognize service with
      Sellers or its Affiliates or predecessors for purposes of Buyer's Retiree
      Welfare Plans.

            (e) Sellers agree that any claims for welfare benefits arising on or
      before the Closing Date with respect to any Transferred Employees (or
      their covered dependents or beneficiaries) shall be the responsibility of
      Sellers, and Buyer agrees that any claims arising subsequent to the
      Closing Date with respect to any Transferred Employees (or their covered
      dependents or beneficiaries) shall be the responsibility of Buyer. A claim
      is deemed to have arisen when the event giving rise to the claim occurred
      or, with respect to health coverages, when the related health services
      were rendered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, a Transferred
      Employee's claim for long-term disability coverage

* Confidential Treatment Requested.


                                       36

<PAGE>

      shall be deemed to have arisen when the initial claim for such disability
      was submitted if such employee (a) is already on long-term disability
      coverage on the Closing Date, or (b) is on short-term disability coverage
      on the Closing Date.

            (f) Sellers shall be responsible for any legally-mandated
      continuation of health care coverage for Facility Employees and/or their
      covered dependents who have a loss of health care coverage due to a
      "qualifying event" (as defined in Section 4980B of the Code or any
      successor thereto and the regulations thereunder) that occurs on or prior
      to the Closing Date, including any Facility Employee or covered dependent
      who is receiving health care coverage under COBRA on the Closing Date.
      Buyer shall be responsible for any legally-mandated continuation of health
      care coverage for Transferred Employees and/or their covered dependents
      who have a loss of health coverage due to a qualifying event that occurs
      after the Closing Date as described in Exhibit F.

            (g) Effective as of the Closing Date, all service completed by
      Transferred Employees with the Sellers, Greenwich or a predecessor thereof
      on or prior to the Closing Date shall be recognized by Buyer for purposes
      of determining the Transferred Employees' [*]. [*]. Sellers shall, within
      a reasonable time prior to Closing, provide Buyer with a schedule of
      accrued vacation time and completed service for each Transferred Employee.

            (h) Buyer shall be free to terminate the employment of any
      Transferred Employee in accordance with Buyer's policies and practices
      generally applicable to all of its employees, as well as Applicable Laws.
      Buyer shall be responsible for severance liabilities, in accordance with
      the severance policy set forth in Exhibit F, attached hereto, only to
      Transferred Employees who meet the following criteria whose employment is
      terminated by Buyer after the Closing Date:

                  (i)   [*]

                  (ii)  [*]

            Severance payments hereunder shall include [*]. [*]. Such extension
      shall represent the first six (6) months of any COBRA continuation
      coverage.

            (i) Sellers maintain spending account plans for the benefit of their
      employees ("Sellers' Spending Account Plans"). For a period of ninety (90)
      days following the Closing Date, Transferred Employees who are
      participants in Sellers' Spending Accounts Plans shall be permitted to
      submit claims for expenses incurred during the plan year on or prior to
      the Closing Date. At the end of the ninety (90)-day period, Sellers shall
      cause the account balances remaining in the accounts of Transferred
      Employees to be transferred in cash to the spending account plans of Buyer
      ("Buyer's Spending Account Plans"). Following such transfer, Buyer (or one
      of its Affiliates) shall be responsible for all liabilities for
      Transferred Employees under Buyer's Spending Account Plans and shall be

                                       37

<PAGE>

      entitled to all funds forfeited from such plans.

            (j) If, after the Closing, a bonus plan established by Sellers for
      Facility Employees prior to Closing is still in effect, Buyer shall assume
      liability for payments to Transferred Employees under such bonus plan that
      have not yet been made as of Closing and shall make all such payments in
      accordance with the plan. At the conclusion of such bonus plan, Buyer
      shall then be free to implement a different bonus plan for Transferred
      Employees.

            (k) Buyer shall not have taken any action on the Closing Date or
      within ninety (90) days on or after the Closing Date the result of which
      would be to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms
      are defined in the WARN Act. Buyer shall assume all liabilities arising
      under any state law related to severance for actions taken on or after
      Closing.

            (l) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
      beneficiary or other rights to any Facility Employee or Transferred
      Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other
      Persons in respect of continued employment with Buyer, with Sellers or any
      of their Affiliates and no provisions of this Agreement shall create any
      rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits which may be
      provided, directly or indirectly, under any benefit plans, programs or
      arrangements which may be operated or maintained by either Buyers or any
      of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein seemingly to the
      contrary, subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, no provision of
      this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the right of Buyer or any
      of its Affiliates, in its sole discretion, to terminate any Transferred
      Employee at will, to modify the terms of employment or salary of any
      Transferred Employee, or to change the terms of any of Buyer's Welfare
      Plans or other employee benefit plans.

            (m) [*]

            (n) All Transferred Employees shall become eligible to enroll in
      Buyer's employee stock purchase plan during the next open enrollment
      period following the Closing.

            Except as set forth in Section 7.2 and this Section 10.2 hereof,
upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 above, all
further obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate without
further liability of any party to the others, except that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for breach of any provision of, or for any
misrepresentation under this Agreement or be deemed to constitute a waiver of
any available remedy for any such breach or misrepresentation. If this Agreement
is terminated by Buyer in accordance with Section 10.1, Sellers and Greenwich
shall repay all payments made by Buyer to a Seller or Greenwich under this
Agreement on or before the Termination Date. Such repayment shall be made by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, no later than thirty (30) days
after the Termination Date, to an account designated in writing by Buyer.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

                                INDEMNIFICATION

            11.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER.

            Sellers hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer,
its Affiliates and its successors and assigns and their respective officers,
directors, employees, attorneys, consultants and agents (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnitees") from and against any and all losses, deficiencies,
liabilities, damages, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys', consultants', and experts' fees (collectively, "Buyer
Losses"), to the extent caused by, resulting from or arising out of:

            (a) any breach of a representation or warranty hereunder on the part
of Greenwich or either or both Sellers in this Agreement;

            (b) any failure by Greenwich or either or both Sellers to perform or
otherwise fulfill, any undertaking or other agreement or obligation hereunder;

            (c) any Excluded Assets and Liabilities; and/or

            (d) any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, and demands
incident to any of the foregoing or such indemnification;

provided, however, that if any claim, liability, demand, assessment, action,
suit or proceeding shall be asserted against a Buyer Indemnitee in respect of
which a Buyer Indemnitee proposes to demand indemnification ("Buyer Indemnified
Claims"), Buyer or such other Buyer Indemnitee shall notify Sellers in writing
thereof as promptly as practicable, provided further, however, that the failure
or delay to so notify Sellers of such a claim shall not reduce or affect
Sellers' obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that Sellers are
prejudiced thereby. Sellers shall have the right promptly upon receipt of such
notice to assume the control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any
such Buyer Indemnified Claims including, at their own expense, employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; provided, however, that if Sellers
shall have exercised their right to assume such control, Buyer may, in its sole
discretion


                                       41

<PAGE>

and at its expense, employ counsel to represent it (in addition to counsel
employed by Sellers) in any such matter, and in such event counsel selected by
Sellers shall be required to cooperate with such counsel of Buyer, counsel
selected by Buyer shall be required to cooperate with such counsel of Sellers
and each of Buyer and Sellers shall be required to cooperate with such other
party and its counsel in such defense, compromise or settlement. Sellers shall
not settle or compromise any Buyer Indemnified Claim that does not result in a
full release without any obligation of Buyer and Buyer Indemnitees without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

            11.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Buyer hereby agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, their Affiliates and their successors and
assigns and their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
consultants and agents (collectively, "Seller Indemnitees") from and against any
and all losses, deficiencies, liabilities, damages, assessments, judgments,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys', consultants', and experts'
fees (collectively, "Sellers Losses"), to the extent caused by, resulting from
or arising out of:

            (a) any breach of a representation or warranty hereunder on the part
of Buyer in this Agreement;

            (b) any failure by Buyer to perform or otherwise fulfill, in whole
or in part, any undertaking or agreement or obligation hereunder; and/or

            (c) any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims and demands
incident to any of the foregoing or such indemnification.

provided, however, that if any claim, liability, demand, assessment, action,
suit or proceeding shall be asserted in respect of which a Seller Indemnitee
proposes to demand indemnification ("Sellers Indemnified Claims"), Sellers or
such other Seller Indemnitee shall notify Buyer in writing thereof as promptly
as practicable, provided further, however, that the failure or delay to so
notify Buyer of such a claim shall not reduce or affect Buyer's obligations with
respect thereto except to the extent that Buyer is prejudiced thereby. Buyer
shall have the right promptly upon receipt of such notice to assume the control
of the defense, compromise or settlement of any such Sellers Indemnified Claims
including, at its own expense, employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Sellers; provided, however, that if Buyer shall have exercised its right to
assume such control, Sellers may, in their sole discretion and at their expense,
employ counsel to represent them (in addition to counsel employed by Buyer) in
any such matter, and in such event counsel selected by Sellers shall be required
to cooperate with such counsel of Buyer, counsel of Buyer shall be required to
cooperate with counsel of Sellers and each of Buyer and Sellers shall be
required to cooperate with such other party and its counsel in such defense,
compromise or settlement. Buyer shall not settle or compromise any Sellers
Indemnified Claim that does not result in a full release without any obligation
of Sellers and Seller Indemnitees without the prior written consent of Sellers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            11.3 CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.


                                       42

<PAGE>

            (a) Other than Sellers' obligation to indemnify for Buyer Losses
      under Section 11.1(a) of this Agreement arising out of a breach of
      representation or warranty contained in Section 4.2 (capitalization) or
      Section 4.12 (brokers), Sellers' obligation to indemnify for Buyer Losses
      under Section 11.1(a) of this Agreement shall not accrue until the
      aggregate of all such Buyer Losses exceeds [*] Dollars ($[*]) (the "Loss
      Threshold") and then Sellers shall be liable for all such Buyer Losses in
      excess of such initial $[*] and shall be limited to [*] Dollars ($[*]) in
      the aggregate. There shall be no Loss Threshold or limit on liability with
      respect to Sellers' obligations to indemnify under Sections 11.1(b)
      through (d).

            (b) In no event shall any punitive, exemplary, special, indirect,
      incidental or consequential damages whatsoever be recoverable by any
      indemnitee under Article 11 hereof; except that, if punitive, exemplary,
      special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages have been asserted
      by a third party against a Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee, the
      indemnifying party shall be liable therefor under the provisions of this
      Article 11.

            (c) Any payment required under this Article 11 paid to any Buyer
      Indemnitee or any Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall be treated
      by the Buyer and the Sellers as an adjustment of the Purchase Price;
      provided, however, that no Buyer Losses indemnified hereunder shall be
      considered payment by Sellers for Net Assets or Facility Costs, and Buyer
      shall have no obligation to pay any amounts to Sellers under Article 2
      with respect to such Buyer Losses.

            (d) This Article 11 sets forth the exclusive rights and remedies of
      Buyer and Sellers for breach of this Agreement or any of the transactions
      contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the right to obtain
      compensation or otherwise seek indemnity pursuant to any cause of action
      including, but not limited to, a claim for breach of contract, for any
      loss directly or indirectly related to the Facility, including without
      limitation, any Buyer Losses or Sellers Losses, but without prejudice to
      the right of any party hereto to seek specific performance of the other
      party's obligations hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE XII.

      forum.

            THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING TO
