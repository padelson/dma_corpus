-vii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 26, 2016 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between Suffolk Bancorp, a New York corporation (the " _Company_
"), and Peoples United Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Purchaser_
").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Purchaser (the " _Merger_
"), so that Purchaser is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger; and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the New York Business Corporation Law (the " _NYBCL_ ") and
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
the Company shall merge with and into Purchaser. Purchaser shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. New
York City time at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, on a date
which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver thereof), or such other date or time mutually agreed in writing by
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



-1- 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
New York (the " _New York Secretary_ ") and the certificate of merger to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Secretary_ "), in each case on the Closing Date (together, the "
_Certificates of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date
and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificates
of Merger.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the NYBCL and the
DGCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or
the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e) and except as set forth in Section 1.7(c), each
share of the common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company
as treasury stock or owned by the Company or Purchaser (in each case other
than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive 2.225 shares (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ " and such shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common
Stock_ "); it being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to
Section 1.6, the Purchaser Common Stock, including the shares issued to
former holders of Company Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ", it
being understood that any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed
to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Purchaser
Common Stock which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted
into the right to receive or, at Purchasers option, evidence of shares in
book entry form (collectively, referred to herein as " _certificates_ "), (ii)
cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon,
and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates representing whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock (together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If,
prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock
or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a

 



-2-  different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or Purchaser (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of Purchaser or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

1.6 _Purchaser Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive a number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option _multiplied by_ (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Stock
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of
such Company Stock Option, _divided by_ (ii) the Purchaser Share Closing
Price, with cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash
amount calculated in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section
2.2(e), _mutatis mutandis_ ). The Surviving Corporation shall issue the
consideration described in this Section 1.7(a), less applicable tax
withholdings, within five (5) business days following the Closing Date. Any
Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Stock Consideration shall
be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. Any stock appreciation right
(a " _Company SAR_ ") granted in tandem with a Company Stock Option that is

converted into the right to receive 2.225 restricted shares of Purchaser
Common Stock, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole number
of shares (each, an " _Adjusted Stock Award_ "). Each Adjusted Stock Award
shall be subject to the same terms, conditions and restrictions (including
any vesting conditions) as were applicable to the converted Rollover Stock
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. No Adjusted Stock Award shall
be subject to accelerated vesting upon or in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein.

date on which the Effective Time occurs) of any outstanding purchase right
pursuant to the ESPP and DSPP, (ii) provide that no further purchase
periods or purchase rights will be available under the ESPP or DSPP from and

the Company and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any

provisions of this Section 1.7.

of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.

1.9 _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall

_Company Bank_ "), will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and into Peoples

become effective concurrently with the Effective Time or at such later time as
Purchaser may determine. At such time after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing as Purchaser may request, Purchaser shall cause
Purchaser Bank and Company shall cause Company Bank to enter into an agreement
and plan of merger in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). Company shall cause Company Bank, and
Purchaser shall cause Purchaser Bank, to execute such certificates of merger
and articles of combination and such other documents and certificates as are
necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ")
concurrently with the Effective Time or at such later time as Purchaser may

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Purchaser to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange
agent designated by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the
shares of Purchaser Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
(such cash and certificates for shares of Purchaser Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5
and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock (other than Company Restricted Stock Awards)
immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to
Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that

 



-5-  delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Purchaser Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
or Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant
to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a
check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by
this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Purchaser
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Purchaser
Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Purchaser Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Purchaser Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued

 



-6-  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares (other than Company
Restricted Stock Awards) are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of
Purchaser Common Stock as provided in this Article II.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Purchaser Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Purchaser shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share (after
aggregating all Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates delivered
by such holder) an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Purchaser Common
Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") as reported by _The
Wall Street Journal_ for the five (5) full trading days ending on the trading
day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Share Closing
Price_ ") by (ii) such aggregated fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Purchaser Common Stock which
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares
of Purchaser Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Purchaser Common Stock deliverable
in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such stockholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration or any payments
due to holders of Company Equity Awards, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Purchaser Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Purchaser or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock
or

 



-7-  Company Equity Awards in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Purchaser, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Purchaser may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Purchaser Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Purchaser concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of
Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article
III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any
Company Reports filed by the Company since December 31, 2013 and prior to the
date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of New York, is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "
_BHC Act_ "), and is duly registered with the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ "). The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this

 



-8-  Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to the
Company, any event, circumstance, development, change or effect that,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) has a material adverse effect on the
business, properties, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ , that, with
respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to
include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules
or regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, or published interpretations
thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date
hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the
outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including
equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates)
conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, (D) public
disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on
the Companys or its Subsidiaries relationships with its customers, employees
or other persons) or actions expressly required by this Agreement or actions
or omissions that are taken with the prior written consent of or at the
written direction of Purchaser, or (E) a decline in the trading price of the
Companys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections or internal financial forecasts (in each case it being understood
that the underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account
in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on the Company has occurred);
except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B) or (C), to the extent that the
effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other similar
companies in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate); or (ii) prevents or materially impairs, or would be reasonably
likely to prevent or materially impair, the ability of the Company to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement,
the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any person, means any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or other person of
which (x) such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least a
majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
others performing similar functions, (y) such first person is or directly or
indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing
member or others performing similar functions or (z) such first person
otherwise controls. As used in this Agreement, the word " _control_ " and the
correlative terms " _controlling_ " and " _controlled_ " mean, with respect to
any specified person, the power to direct the management and policies of such
person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise. True and complete copies of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ ")
and the By-Laws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company
to Purchaser.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is

 



-9-  duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct
of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be
so qualified would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all
requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are
no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to
pay dividends or distributions except for restrictions on dividends or
distributions under applicable law and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Subsidiary of the Company that is an insured depository institution are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through
the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or
threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of (x) all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date
hereof, (y) all persons (not including Company Subsidiaries) in which the
Company, together with any Company Subsidiaries, owns (directly or indirectly)
more than 4.9% of a class of voting securities and (z) any "covered fund" (as
defined in 12 C.F.R. §248.10(b)) in which the Company, together with any
Company Subsidiaries, owns (directly or indirectly) any interest.

have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders
of the Company may vote. No trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of
the Company are issued or outstanding. Other than Company Stock Options and
the Company Restricted Stock Awards, as of the date of this Agreement there
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements (A)
obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, any such securities or (B) linked to, or based upon, the value of
Company securities. There are no

 



-10-  voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other
equity interests of the Company. All grants of Company Equity Awards were
validly issued and properly approved by the board of directors of the Company
(or a committee thereof) in accordance with the applicable Company Stock Plan
and applicable law, in each case in all material respects.

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to the Company
Bank, as provided under 12 U.S.C. §55) and free of preemptive rights. No
Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Purchaser) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and the availability of equitable remedies (the " _Enforceability
Exceptions_ ")).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor

violate any provision of the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws or
(ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4 are
duly obtained, (x) violate any law,

of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults,
losses of benefit under, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or
creations which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required
by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, except

Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has

information, and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Purchaser to
the Company concurrently herewith (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Purchaser that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect, and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article IV
shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article IV specifically
referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article IV to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Purchaser
Reports filed by Purchaser since December 31, 2013 and prior to the date

the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Purchaser Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event,
circumstance, development, change or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, prevents or materially impairs, or would be reasonably likely to
prevent or materially impair, the ability of Purchaser to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. True and complete copies of the
Purchaser Certificate and Purchaser Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of

organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would, either individually or in
the aggregate,

 



-28-  reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and

of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Purchaser
(x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Purchaser, including its Subsidiaries, is made known
to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Purchaser

Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has

adversely affect Purchasers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of Purchaser, any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Purchasers internal controls over financial reporting.
To the knowledge of Purchaser, there is no reason to believe that Purchasers
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting

 



-33-  controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Purchaser or any of its

allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an
agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries). Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return

therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of
obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor
the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect, and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, no suspension or cancellation of
any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened.
Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries have

Requisite Regulatory Approvals), and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Governmental Entities and third parties. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than twenty (20)
business days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file
any applications, notices and filings required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

(c) Purchaser and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and,
to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall
consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the
other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Purchaser
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.

(e) Purchaser and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective

 



-43-  Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Purchaser and the Company shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed.

(g) As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall
mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals from (x) the
Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC; and (y) any other approvals
set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 that are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank
Merger, except in the case of this clause (y) for any such authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect ( _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (g), references
to "the Company" in the definition of Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed
to refer to "the Surviving Corporation").

6.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of
Purchaser, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, personnel,
information technology systems and records, and shall cooperate with Purchaser
in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation
of systems and business operations generally, and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to
Purchaser (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking laws
(other than reports or documents that the Company is not permitted to disclose
under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Purchaser may reasonably request. Upon reasonable
notice and subject to applicable laws, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the Company, access, in each
case solely for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties
of Purchaser in Article IV, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
personnel, information technology systems and records. Neither Purchaser nor
the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of Purchasers or the Companys, as the
case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or

 



-44-  similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate and make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Each of Purchaser and the Company shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated May 2, 2016, between Purchaser and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.3 _Stockholders  Approval_. The Company shall call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") as soon as
reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of
stockholders to adopt a merger agreement. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders
of the Company the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its
stockholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement) that they adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall engage a proxy solicitor
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to assist in the solicitation of proxies
from Company stockholders relating to the Requisite Company Vote. However,
subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Board of Directors of the Company,
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it
would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement
to its stockholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may (but shall not
be required to) submit this Agreement to its stockholders
without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as
of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board
of Directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ ,
that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take any actions under this
sentence unless (i) it gives the Purchaser at least five (5) business days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board
of Directors of the Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest
material terms and conditions of (including a copy of the most recent proposed
acquisition agreement, if

 



-45-  any), and the identity of the third party making, any such Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable
detail such other event or circumstances), (ii) during such five (5) business
day period, if requested by Purchaser, the Company and its Representatives
shall engage in good faith negotiations with Purchaser and its Representatives
to amend or modify this Agreement in such a manner that it would not
reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to continue to recommend this Agreement as so amended
or modified ( _provided_ that in no event shall the Company be obligated
to enter into any such amendment or modification of this Agreement), and
(iii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company
takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by
the Purchaser and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would nevertheless reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. The Company shall adjourn
or postpone the Company Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is
originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the
Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall continue to use all reasonable
best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to solicit proxies from
stockholders in favor of the Requisite Company Vote. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the
other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Purchaser and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Company or Purchaser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Purchaser shall cause the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



-46- 6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continue to be employed by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following
the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), solely during any period
of employment of such Continuing Employees prior to the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable,
that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-term incentive
compensation opportunity that is substantially comparable to the short-term
incentive compensation opportunity (including equity awards that are granted
in respect of such short-term incentive opportunity, regardless of the vesting
period) provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall take into account any payments made to Continuing Employees
pursuant to Section 6.6(f)), and (iii) other compensation, including long-
term incentive opportunities, and employee benefits (other than severance
benefits, which will be provided as set forth in last sentence hereof) that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the other
compensation, including long-term incentive opportunities, and employee
benefits (other than severance benefits) provided by Purchaser to similarly-
situated employees of Purchaser, _provided_ that, until such time as Purchaser
can transfer the Continuing Employees to its corresponding benefit plans,
providing other compensation, including long-term incentive opportunities, and
employee benefits (other than severance benefits) no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed
to satisfy the requirements of this clause (iii). Purchaser shall, or shall
cause one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing Employee whose
employment terminates during the 12-month period following the Closing Date
severance benefits on terms consistent with the Amended and Restated Suffolk
Bancorp / Suffolk County National Bank Severance Policy, in the form provided
to Purchaser.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Purchaser shall or shall
cause one of its Subsidiaries to: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide each such employee and his or her eligible
dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred by such employee or
dependent prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the
same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii)
recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries
for all purposes in any New Plan

 



-47-  to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (x) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (y) for the
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension or the employer
premium subsidy under any retiree medical plan or (z) to any benefit plan
that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee
population.

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, assume and
honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. Purchaser
hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the
meaning of the Company Benefit Plans (to the extent they include such a
definition or phrase) will occur at the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may establish a cash-based
retention program in the aggregate amount of $1,250,000 to promote retention
and to incentivize efforts to consummate the Closing, consistent with the
terms and conditions set forth in Section 6.6(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

(e) If requested by Purchaser in writing at least twenty (20) business days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored
or maintained by the Company (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be
terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time
and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Purchaser
requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall
provide Purchaser with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form
and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by
Purchaser) not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Effective
Time and (ii) the Continuing Employees of the Company shall be eligible
to participate, effective promptly following the Effective Time, in a 401(k)
plan sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "). Purchaser and the Company shall take any and all
actions as may be required, including amendments to any Company 401(k) Plan
and/or Purchaser 401(k) Plan, to permit each Continuing Employee who is a
participant in the Company 401(k) Plan to be eligible to commence
participation in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date and make
rollover contributions to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash, notes (in the case of loans), Purchaser Common Stock or a
combination thereof in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributable to such Continuing Employee of the Company from a Company 401(k)
Plan.

 

(f) The Company shall have the right, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
to pay to each participant in an annual bonus program for the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs, a pro-rated bonus based on actual performance of
the Company for the portion of such calendar year commencing January 1 through
and including the Closing Date, with such bonus calculated in good faith in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to

 



-48-  continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Purchaser or
any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of
any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit
the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan,
New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
third sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and
former director, officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in
each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Purchaser
shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; _provided_ that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a
reasonable and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Company
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ , that
Purchaser may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective

 



-49-  Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_
, that Purchaser shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an
amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then
Purchaser shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in
Purchasers good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the
Company, in consultation with Purchaser, may (and at the request
of Purchaser, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at
or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not
exceed the Premium Cap. If the Company purchases such a "tail policy,"
Purchaser shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder for such six-year period.

(c) The obligations of Purchaser and the Company under this Section 6.7 shall
not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to
the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent of the
affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge
into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in
each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7 are not
otherwise transferred and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation
of law or otherwise, Purchaser will cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of Purchaser will expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any
of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other party.

 

6.9 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Purchaser Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Purchaser Common Stock
any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 



-50- 6.10 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions
with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that,
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company by
the Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is more likely than
not to result in a Superior Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries
and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be
furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations
or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to
take such actions would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, the Company shall have provided such information to Purchaser and
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement,
which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than
Purchaser with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Purchaser in writing
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance
thereof (including the material terms and conditions of (including a copy of
the most recent proposed acquisition agreement, if any), and the identity of
the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will keep
Purchaser reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of
the material terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to, within ten
(10) business days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to any person (other than
Purchaser and its affiliates and its and their Representatives) pursuant to
any existing confidentiality, standstill or similar agreements to which it or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Unless
this Agreement is contemporaneously terminated in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to on its
behalf, enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
other definitive transaction agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in 

 



-51-  accordance with this Section 6.10(a)). As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third
party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company,
(ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the
Company. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to
the Companys stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisor
(who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after
taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the
terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with
the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of
any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including
any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any
other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "25%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority."

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
from making any legally required disclosure to the Companys stockholders;
_provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.

 

6.11 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Purchaser shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan, to ensure
that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required
by applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.12 _Change of Method_. The Company and Purchaser shall be empowered, upon
their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the
method or structure of effecting the combination of the Company and Purchaser
(including the provisions of Article I), if and to the extent they both deem
such change to be necessary, appropriate or

 



-52-  desirable; _provided_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock received by
the Companys stockholders in exchange for each share of Company Common
Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Companys stockholders
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the
Company or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
timely manner. The parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with
Section 9.2.

6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Purchaser or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.14 _Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b)_. The Company and
Purchaser agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
those officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_
"), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company
Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this Section 6.14. The Board of Directors of Purchaser and
of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall reasonably promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take
all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of the Company) any
dispositions of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company
Insiders, and (in the case of Purchaser) any acquisitions of Purchaser Common
Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be
officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

6.15 _Advice of Changes_. Purchaser and the Company (in such capacity, the "
_Notifying Party_ ") shall each promptly advise the other party of any fact,
change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, in the case of the
Company, or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, in the case of Purchaser, or
(ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties
or covenants contained

 



-53-  herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in
the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in, if Purchaser is the Notifying
Party, Sections 7.1 or 7.3, or if the Company is the Notifying Party,
Sections 7.1 or 7.2; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this Section 6.15 or the failure of any
condition set forth in Sections 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied.

6.16 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Purchaser and the Company
shall promptly notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration,
audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the
other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be
taken by Purchaser, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with respect
hereto or thereto or (b) seeks to enjoin, materially delay or otherwise
restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall
give Purchaser the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or
its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Purchasers prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

6.17 _DRIP_. The Company shall take such actions as is necessary to provide
that as of no later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date no
further Company Common Stock will be purchased under the DRIP; _provided_ that
such cessation on further purchases following the Closing Date shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

 

6.18 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Purchaser and the Company shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.19 _Advisory Board_. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall establish a regional advisory board consisting of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time who
wish to serve on such advisory board.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated upon written notice
(specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected) at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company:

(a) by mutual consent of Purchaser and the Company in a written
instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board;

(b) by either Purchaser or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the
Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure
to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the

 



-57-  failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either Purchaser or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth herein;

(d) by either Purchaser or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a
breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or
warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true)
set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a
termination by Purchaser, or Purchaser, in the case of a termination by the
Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Purchaser, or 7.3, in the case
of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within forty-five (45)
days following written notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by
Purchaser, or Purchaser, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by
its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as
remain prior to the Termination Date);

 

(e) by Purchaser, but only prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (A) failed
to recommend in the Proxy Statement that the stockholders of the Company adopt
this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a
manner adverse to Purchaser, or publicly disclosed that it has resolved to do
so, or failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange
offer constituting an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly disclosed
within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof
or (B) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal or failed to issue a
press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal within
ten (10) business days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced,
or (ii) the Company or its Board of Directors has breached in any material
respect its obligations under the first sentence of Section 6.3 or the first
or second sentences of Section 6.10; or

(f) by either Purchaser or the Company if the Company Meeting (including
any postponements or adjournments thereof) shall have concluded with the vote
contemplated by Section 3.3(a) having been taken and the Requisite Company
Vote shall not have been obtained; _provided_ that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) if it has not complied in
all material respects with its obligations under Section 6.3 (including by
complying with any adjournment or postponement obligations under Section 6.3).

 



-58- 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Purchaser or the
Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Purchaser, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) and
this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor the Company shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or Willful
Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to termination
(which, in the case of the Company, shall include the loss to the holders of
Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards of the economic benefits of the
Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, it being understood that the Company
shall be entitled to pursue damages for such losses and to enforce the right
to recover such losses on behalf of its shareholders and the holders of
Company Equity Awards in its sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts
received by the Company in connection therewith may be retained by the
Company). " _Willful Breach_ " shall mean a material breach of, or failure to
perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in, this
Agreement, that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching
or non-performing party with actual knowledge, or knowledge that a person
acting reasonably under the circumstances should have, that such partys act
or failure to act would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in or
constitute a breach of or failure of performance under this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management or the Board of Directors of the Company
or has been made directly to its stockholders generally or any person shall
have publicly announced (whether or not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company and (A) (x) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained at the Company Meeting
(and all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(d), 7.1(e), 7.3(a) and
7.3(b) had been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such
termination) or Section 8.1(f) or (y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated
by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a Willful Breach of
this Agreement and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the
date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and
the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Purchaser, by wire transfer
of same day funds, a fee equal to sixteen million dollars ($16,000,000) (the "
_Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b),
all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall
instead refer to "50%".

 



-59- (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant
to Section 8.1(e), then the Company shall pay Purchaser, by wire transfer of
same day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date
of termination.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
partys fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement, the
maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by
the Company under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee, and
the Company shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Purchaser would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Purchaser
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses of Purchaser
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit. In addition, if the Company fails to pay any amount due pursuant to
Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall pay interest on such overdue amount at
a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and
Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made, for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a
penalty, and except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole
and exclusive monetary remedy of Purchaser in the event of a termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable and is
paid in full.

hereto.
