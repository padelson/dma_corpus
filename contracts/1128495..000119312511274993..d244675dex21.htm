this Agreement and the Transactions.

E. In order to induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the members of

1 AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1. The Offer

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with section 8, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement
but in no event more than seven business days after the date of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of
the other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer
Conditions_ "), promptly after the later of (i) the earliest date as of which
Purchaser is permitted under applicable Legal Requirements to accept for
payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest date as of
which the Minimum Condition has been satisfied and each of the other Offer
Conditions has been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Purchaser, Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance
with its terms and accept for payment each Share validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and promptly following the acceptance
of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer pay the Offer Price (without
interest but subject to any applicable Tax withholding) for each Share validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and set
forth in the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser
expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any
Offer Condition other than the Minimum Condition and (iii) make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided
by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser
shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer
Conditions in a manner that adversely affects, or reasonably could
adversely affect, any holder of Shares, (F) change or waive the Minimum
Condition, or (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner
other than as required or permitted by this Agreement. The Offer may not be
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date),
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with section 8.

 

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the
date that is 20 business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ " _)_ or, in the event the Initial Expiration

 



2  Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement,
the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is
referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(1) If on the scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied or any of the other Offer Conditions have not been satisfied (other
than conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer
Acceptance Time), or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder,
then prior to the then scheduled expiration date, Purchaser shall extend the
Offer for one or more periods of not more than ten business days each (or such
other number of business days as the parties may agree and ending no later
than the End Date), in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions
(subject to the right of Purchaser to waive any Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Condition) in accordance with this Agreement); and

(2) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable Legal Requirements, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff or NASDAQ or its staff, provided Purchaser shall extend the then current
Expiration Date of the Offer to a period ending on the first business day on
which the Offer can be accepted under applicable Legal Requirements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Purchaser be required to
extend the Offer beyond the End Date. 

(f) Purchaser may (and the Offer Documents shall reserve the right of
Purchaser to) provide for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in compliance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act of not less than three nor more than 20 business days
(for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) immediately following the expiration of the Offer. Subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall, accept for payment and pay for
all Shares validly tendered during such subsequent offering period as promptly
as practicable after any such Shares are tendered during such subsequent
offering period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act. 

(g) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within two business days of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer, shall not acquire any shares pursuant to
the Offer and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to
return, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.

 

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with

 



3  all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will include the summary term sheet required thereby
and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and form of the related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and
related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser agree
that they shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto (which together constitute the " _Offer Documents_ ")
filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company
shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or
Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Acquired Corporations
and the Companys stockholders that may be required in connection with any
action contemplated by this Section 1.1(h). The Company and its counsel shall
be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

 

(i) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.12, Parent shall cause to be
provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause
Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser
shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares
held by them into the Offer.

1.2 Company Actions.

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that its Board of
Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Transactions in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, and (iii)
resolved to recommend that stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and, if necessary, under applicable
Legal Requirements, adopt this Agreement (such recommendation set forth in
this clause (a) the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). Subject to Section
1.2(b): the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of a description of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

 



4 (b)

(i) During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall (A)(1) fail to make, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board
Recommendation or (2) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal
(any action described in this clause (A) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Change Recommendation_ ") or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow any Acquired
Corporation to execute or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, term sheet, Contract or similar instrument constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or would be reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Transaction, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause,
the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Transactions (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.3(a));

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to Purchaser accepting, for the first time, for payment and
paying for such number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as satisfies the Minimum Condition (the " _Offer
Acceptance Time_ "), the Company Board may make an Adverse Change
Recommendation: (A) in response to an Intervening Event if: (1) the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse Change
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) the Company shall
have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making an
Adverse Change Recommendation at least three business days prior to making any
Adverse Change Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation Notice_ "); (3)
the Company shall have given Parent the three business days after the Change
of Recommendation Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
or make another proposal and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent
with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any; and (4)
after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Companys Board of Directors shall have determined, in good
faith, that the failure to make the Adverse Change Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; or (B) in response to an Acquisition Proposal if: (1) the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Adverse
Change Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) the Company shall have
given Parent a Change of Recommendation Notice at least three business days
prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation; (3) the Company shall have
provided to Parent the most current version of the proposed agreement under
which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity
of the third party making the Acquisition Proposal and, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of Directors shall have
determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer;
(4) the Company shall have given Parent the three business days after the
Change of Recommendation Notice to

 



5  propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal
and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such
proposed revisions or other proposal, if any; and (5) after considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by
Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Companys
Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the
Adverse Change Recommendation would constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of
the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company
and a new three business day period under this Section 1.2(b)(ii)). In
addition, nothing contained in this Section 1.2 or Section 5.3(a) shall
prevent the Company or the Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14a-9,
14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or is otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ that any such action taken
or disclosure made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to
be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Companys Board of Directors
reaffirms the Boards recommendation of this Agreement and the Transactions in
such statement or disclosure in connection with such action (except that a
mere "stop, look and listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

(c) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced,
following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the SEC
and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that,
subject to Section 1.2(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each
of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any
amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company
agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. The Company represents that is
has obtained all necessary consents to include in its entirety the fairness
opinion of Lazard Freres and Co. LLC, financial advisor to the Company, in
Schedule 14D-9. The Schedule shall include such fairness opinion in its
entirety and a description of such fairness opinion and the financial analyses
relating thereto that provides, in all material respects, the information
called for by applicable Legal Requirements, including without limitation,
the information called for by Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act.

 



6 (d) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case
true and correct as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to
Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Parent and
Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all
copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their
possession or control. 

1.3 Directors.

(a) Upon the Offer Acceptance Time and all times thereafter, subject to
compliance with applicable Legal Requirements and the applicable Marketplace
Rules of NASDAQ, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of
Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (after giving effect to
the directors elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of their Affiliates (including
Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request at any time following
the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, take all such
actions necessary to (A) appoint to the Board of Directors of the Company the
individuals designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so designated by the
first sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including, but not limited to, promptly
filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors of
the Company, promptly increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the
Company (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to
increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company) and/or promptly
securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are
necessary or desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected or
designated to the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B) cause
Purchasers designees to be so appointed at such time. The Company shall, upon
Purchasers request following the Offer Acceptance Time, also cause Persons
elected or designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded
up to the next whole number) as is on the Board of Directors of the Company of
each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.
From and after the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by
NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(1) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status. The Companys obligations under this
Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of
this Agreement take all 

 



7  actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to
stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the information required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Purchasers designees
to be elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company.
Purchaser shall supply the Company with, and be solely responsible for,
information with respect to Purchasers designees and Parents and Purchasers
respective officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial
owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Legal Requirements with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to
the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the
Company to maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Board of
Directors of the Company on or prior to the date hereof and who are not
officers, directors or employees of Parent, Purchaser, or any of their
Affiliates, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule
5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rules,
and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as
defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K (the " _Continuing
Directors_ "); _provided, however,_ that if any Continuing Director is unable
to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all
necessary action (including creating a committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or
designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person
(or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three Persons who are not officers, directors or employees of
Parent, Purchaser, or any of their Affiliates to fill such vacancies and such
Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of
the Company after the Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time,
then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in
addition to the approval rights of the Board of Directors of the Company or
the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Company Charter
Documents or applicable Legal Requirements) be required (i) for the Company to
amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would
adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, the
holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser), (iii) to amend the Company
Charter Documents if such action would adversely affect the holders of Shares
(other than Parent or Purchaser), or (iv) to take any other action of the
Board of Directors of the Company under or in connection with this Agreement
if such action would adversely affect, or would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect, the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser). The
Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing
Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company) and
other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement.

 



8 1.4 Top-Up Option.

 

(a) The Company grants to Parent and Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the number of newly-issued Shares
(such newly-issued shares, the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser
of (i) the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by
Parent and Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Shares that would be
outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares subject to the Top-Up
Option on a fully diluted basis or (ii) the aggregate number of Shares that
the Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but
that are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise
committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. The
Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective
Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in
part, at any time on or after the Offer Acceptance Time, in its sole
discretion; _provided, however,_ that the obligation of the Company to
deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject
to the conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (i) immediately
following the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares owned in
the aggregate by Parent and Purchaser constitutes at least one share more than
90% of the number of Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the
issuance of all Top-Up Option Shares on a fully diluted basis and (ii)
the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied. The parties shall cooperate
to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished
consistent with all applicable Legal Requirements, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under
the Securities Act.

(c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares shall
be determined by multiplying the number of Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer
Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Purchaser, at its
election, either (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by payment in cash of the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and payment of the balance by
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note (with full recourse
to Parent) having a principal amount equal to the difference between the
purchase price and the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares, or
(iii) any combination thereof. Any such promissory note shall bear simple
interest at the rate of 6% per annum, shall mature on the first anniversary of
the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note, may be prepaid
without premium or penalty and shall be extinguished and no longer due to the
Company at the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ upon any Event of Default,
all principal and accrued interest thereunder shall immediately become due
and payable.

(d) In the event Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i)
the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Parent or Purchaser intends to
purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or
Purchaser intends to pay the applicable exercise price and (iii) the place and
time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares is to
take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
Parent or Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-

 



9  Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to
Parent or Purchaser (as the case may be) a certificate or certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, at Parents or Purchasers request
or otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the
applicable number of non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (the "
_Book-Entry Shares_ "). Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include
any legends required by applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and will be
acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act.

Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights,
powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Purchaser, all
as provided under the DGCL.

 



10 2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to read in its entirety as the
certificate of incorporation of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that (i) Article FIRST thereof shall read in its
entirety: "The name of the corporation is Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the

Time shall be amended to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Purchaser as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be

with applicable Legal Requirements, (i) the directors of Purchaser at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of the
Company:

 

(i) any Shares then held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

 

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting Shares,

with Section 2.6(e); and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



11 2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of
such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.5 a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing
such shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of
any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following the 180th day after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements.

 



12 (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from
the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Shares such amounts as it
is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure
that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body. If any withholding obligation may be avoided by
a payee providing information or documentation to the applicable payor, such
payor shall request such information from such payee and use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such withholding obligation. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

2.7 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding Section 2.5, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration but rather shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and
to the extent provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, unless such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal. If
after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses
such holders right to appraisal, each such Share shall be treated as if it
had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration without any interest thereon (less any amounts entitled
to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)). The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands. Parent shall not, except with the prior
written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree and acknowledge that, in any appraisal
proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares,
the Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up
Option Shares or any cash or promissory note delivered by Merger Sub to the
Company in payment for such Top-Up Shares should be considered in connection
with the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

2.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and 

 



13  to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized
(in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take
such action.

any shares of its capital stock or any other securities.

3.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2009, the Company has filed on a timely basis all
required reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses, registration
statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated therein) with the SEC (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied, and each Company
SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents and, except to the extent
that information contained in any Company SEC Document has been revised,
modified or superseded (prior to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed
Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents when filed contained,
and each Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will not
contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes) contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i) complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ " _)_ applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be indicated
in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor
form under the Exchange Act, and except that the unaudited financial
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated

 



16  Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby. No financial statements of any
Person other than the Acquired Corporations are required by GAAP to be
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2010 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Acquired Corporations; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the assets of the Acquired Corporations that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. The Companys management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and,
except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, such assessment concluded that such controls were effective
and the Companys independent registered accountant has issued (and not
subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2010,
none of the Acquired Corporations nor the Companys independent registered
accountant has identified or been made aware of: (A) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting utilized by the Acquired Corporations; (B) any
illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Companys
management or other employees; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure made by management to the Companys independent registered
accountants and audit committee since January 1, 2010.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of
the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.
The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select
Market.

 



17 (e) None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to or has any obligation or
other commitment to become a party to any joint venture, securitization
transaction, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including
any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Acquired Corporations, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose Entity,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, any Acquired Corporation in
any Acquired Corporations published financial statements or other Company
SEC Documents.

(f) There have been no written inquiries, interrogatories or comments with
respect to any of the Company SEC Documents from the SEC, NASDAQ or any other
Governmental Body received since January 1, 2010, and the Company has not been
made aware of any such inquiries, interrogatories or comments that were oral.

operated in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
and, between December 31, 2010 and the date of this Agreement there has not
occurred any event, occurrence, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance, fact or
other matter that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement since June 30, 2011 through the date of this
Agreement, the Company has not taken any actions which, had such actions been
taken after the date of this Agreement, would have breached any of the
covenants set out in Section 5.2.

all assets owned by them as of the date of this Agreement, including all
assets (other than capitalized or operating leases) reflected on the unaudited
balance sheet in the last Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the " _Balance Sheet_
") filed by the Company with the SEC (except for assets sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of such Balance
Sheet). All of said assets are owned by the Acquired Corporations free and
clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). 

3.7 Real Property; Equipment.

(a) The Company and the Acquired Corporations do not own and have not owned
any real property.

(b) Part 3.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and

Property_ "). True and complete

 



18  copies of all such leases or subleases have been delivered or made available
to Parent or Parents Representatives and each such lease or sublease is in
full force and effect. The Company or the applicable Subsidiary holds a valid
and existing leasehold interest in each Leased Real Property. None of the

obligations under such leases.

 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, the use and operation of the Leased Real
Property is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
zoning, land use, building, fire and other applicable Legal Requirements. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no existing plan or study by any
Governmental Body or by any other Person that challenges or otherwise
adversely affects the continuation of the present use or operation of any
Leased Real Property. There are no subleases, sublicenses, occupancy
agreements or other contractual obligations that grant the right to use or
occupancy of any of the Leased Real Property to any Person other than the
Company, and there is no Person in possession of any Leased Real Property
other than the Company.

(d) Part 3.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and
complete list of all subleases, occupancy agreements and other Company

been pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which the
scope, validity or enforceability of any Registered IP listed on Part 3.8(a)

knowledge of the Company, each of the Acquired Corporations co-owned patents
and patent applications) properly identifies by name each and every inventor
of the claims thereof as determined in accordance with the Legal Requirements
of the jurisdiction in which such patent is issued or such patent application
is pending. Part 3.8(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes each
filing, payment, and action that must be made or taken on or before the date

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice between the
Acquired Corporations and their employees) (each, an " _Inbound License_ ").
Part 3.8(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company
Contract pursuant to which there is an outbound license of Company IP (each,
an " _Outbound License_ ").

(d) No officer or other employee, or independent contractor, consultant or

promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar
organization that would reasonably be expected to require or obligate any of
the Acquired Corporations to grant or offer to any other Person any license
or right to any Company IP.

 



20 (h) The operation of the business of the Acquired Corporations does not
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate, and has not infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated, any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights owned or held by any other Person. To the
knowledge of the Company, no other Person has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights
owned by the Acquired Corporations. No Legal Proceeding has been asserted in
the past six years or is pending and served (or, to the knowledge of the
Company, is being threatened or is pending and has not been served) (i)
against any Acquired Corporation relating to any actual, alleged or suspected
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Right of another Person or (ii) by the Acquired
Corporations related to the Acquired Corporations Registered IP or any of the
Acquired Corporations Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights.

disposition of dispute that adversely restricts the use,
transfer, registration or licensing of any such Company IP by the Acquired
Corporations, or otherwise adversely affects the validity, scope, use,
registrability, or enforceability of any such Company IP. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not alter, encumber,
impair or extinguish the Acquired Corporations rights in any Company IP.

Securities Act.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has either delivered or
otherwise made available to Parent or Parents Representatives an accurate

is in material breach of or material default under any Material Contract and
neither the Acquired Corporations, nor to the knowledge of the Company
any other Person, has taken or failed to take any action which, with or

the Company, enforceable by the applicable Acquired Corporation in accordance
with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general application relating to

any Material Contract, the waiver of which would have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) With respect to each Government Contract to which a U.S.
federal Governmental Body is a party or that is a Material Contract, to the
knowledge of the Company, (i) all representations and certifications executed,
acknowledged or set forth in or pertaining to such Government Control were
complete and correct in all material respects as of their effective date, and
each Acquired Corporation, as applicable, has complied in all material
respects with all such representations and certifications; (ii) neither the
United States government nor any prime contractor, subcontractor or other
Person has notified any Acquired Corporation that an Acquired Corporation has

the Companys knowledge, threatened investigation by the FDA pursuant to its
Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities

Time.

 



38 5.3 No Solicitation.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not directly or
indirectly, and shall not authorize or permit any other Acquired Corporation
or any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations directly or
indirectly to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to
facilitate or encourage the submission or announcement of any Acquisition
Proposal (including by granting any waiver under Section 203 of the DGCL),
(ii) furnish any information regarding, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records (except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements) of, any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in
connection with or in response to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal or an
inquiry or indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or indication
of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (v)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or similar document or any
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction;
_provided, however,_ that prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this Section 5.3
shall not prohibit the Company from furnishing nonpublic information regarding
the Acquired Corporations to, or entering into discussions with, any Person
in response to an Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to the Company by
such Person (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither the Company nor any
Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations shall have breached
or taken any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in this
Section 5.3, (2) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good
faith, that such Acquisition Proposal or other proposal could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Offer and, after consulting with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Companys Board of
Directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements,
(3) at least two business days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to, or entering into discussions with, such Person, the Company
gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and of the
Companys intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions with, such Person, and the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for
informational purposes only to Parent) in a customary form that is no less
favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (which the Company
may negotiate with the Person during the two business day notice period)
and (4) the Company concurrently furnishes such nonpublic information to
Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously
furnished or made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives).

 

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or
indication of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information) advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication
of interest that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to any of the
Acquired Corporations (including the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or
request, and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person

 



39  during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or request and any modification or proposed
modification thereto.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to
any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or indication of interest that could
lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) The Company agrees, except as determined by the Companys Board of
Directors in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that the
failure to take such action would reasonably constitute a breach of fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements not to release or permit the release during the
Pre-Closing Period of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any
provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which
any of the Acquired Corporations is a party, and the Company shall not grant
or permit any such waiver unless the obligations of Roche Holdings, Inc. under
the Confidentiality Agreement are waived to the same extent pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

SECTION 6. Additional Covenants of the Parties

6.1 Stockholder Approval; Proxy Statement.

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by Legal Requirements in order to consummate the Merger, the Company
shall, subject to Sections 1.2(b) and 5.3, and as promptly as practicable
following the expiration of the Offer, take all action necessary under all
applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
the holders of Shares to vote on the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Company shall
ensure that all proxies solicited by the Company in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by applicable Legal Requirements in order to consummate the Merger,

following the expiration of the Offer, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement and shall use all reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of
the SEC or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders, as promptly as practicable. Parent and Purchaser will
provide to the Company any information with respect to Parent and Purchaser
and their respective officers, directors, Affiliates and agents required to

or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall give Parent an opportunity to review any written
correspondence with the SEC or its staff or any proposed material to be
included in the

 



40  Proxy Statement prior to transmission to the SEC or its staff and the
Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements, and the Company further agrees to
cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, if
any such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act or the SEC (or its staff).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Purchaser shall own by virtue of the Offer or otherwise at least 90% of the
outstanding Shares, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the merger of Purchaser and the Company to become effective
as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a
stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

(d) Parent agrees to cause all Shares owned by Parent or any subsidiary of
Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of the Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

6.2 Filings and Approvals.

 

(a) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
all Offer Conditions to be satisfied on a timely basis (to the extent the
satisfaction of such Offer Conditions is within such partys direct or
indirect control) and to cause Purchaser to purchase Shares pursuant to the
Offer on the earliest possible date.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable)
shall: (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after
the date hereof, file any and all notices, reports and other

Act with respect to the Transactions, (ii) promptly provide all information
and documentary material requested by any Governmental Body in connection with
the Transactions, and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken,
on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose
of consummating and effectuating the Transactions.

(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.2 or any other
provision of this Agreement, the reasonable best efforts of any party hereto
shall not be deemed to include, and no party shall be obligated to, (i) enter
into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement
with any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) litigate, challenge or take any other action with respect to any
action or proceeding by any Governmental Body or (iii) divest, license, hold
separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), transfer or dispose
of, before or after the Closing, any assets, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein (or otherwise agree to

 



41  do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its or the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates businesses,
assets or properties. The Acquired Corporations shall not take, or agree to
take, any of the actions referred to in the preceding sentence without the
prior written consent of Parent.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.2,
each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making
or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed as to the status
of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the
FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body regarding the Transactions. Each party
hereto shall promptly furnish to the other party, subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement, to limit disclosure to counsel and outside
consultants, with copies of all documents provided to or received from any
Governmental Body regarding the Transactions. Each party hereto will consult
and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the
Transactions, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the
other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

 

6.3 Stock Options.

(a) As of the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised Company Option
then in effect, whether vested or unvested, (and each plan, if any, under
which any Company Option may be granted) shall be cancelled, terminated and
extinguished, and upon the cancellation thereof the holder of each such
unexpired and unexercised Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be
granted the right to receive, in respect of each Share subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount (subject to
any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to: (i) the Offer Price; minus
(ii) the exercise price per share of each Share subject to such Company
Option (it being understood that, each unexercised Company Option (with an
exercise price equal to or greater than the Offer Price) shall be canceled at
the Effective Time without consideration therefor). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions that may be necessary (under the plans and award agreements pursuant
to which Company Options are outstanding and otherwise) to accelerate the
vesting and exercisability of each unexpired and unexercised Company Option
that is an incentive stock option then in effect so that each such Company
Option shall be fully vested and exercisable prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, provided that the holder of such Company Option agrees to tender any
Shares acquired upon exercise of such Company Option into the Offer.

 



42 (b) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements to ensure that,
except for the six month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on May
16, 2011, no additional offering shall be authorized or commenced. The rights
of participants in the ESPP with respect to any offering period then underway
under the ESPP shall be determined by treating the last business day prior to
the Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and by making such
other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP.
The Company shall terminate the ESPP effective as of the Effective Time.
Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary
to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.3(b). 

(c) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to assume all outstanding Company Warrants and shall take all actions
necessary and required to comply with the terms of such Company Warrants.

6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of at least one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide to each employee of the Acquired
Corporations who continues to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
(or any Subsidiary thereof) (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") total
compensation (including employee benefits other than equity based compensation
and retention benefits and based on bonus opportunity rather than actual bonus
payments) that is at least substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing:

 

(a) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, assume the liability for
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing
Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance
with the practice and policies of the applicable Acquired Corporation.

 

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit
plans; _provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan at any time,
and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or
welfare benefit plan, then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition
period), the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in
Parents health and welfare benefit plans, to substantially the same extent as
similarly situated employees of Parent. To the extent that service is relevant
for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any
health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation,
then Parent shall ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and allowances (including paid time off) but
not for purposes of benefit accrual, credit Continuing Employees

 



43  for service prior to the Effective Time with the Acquired Corporations to
the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time
under the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company.
Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed
to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and the
employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

(c) On or before January 15, 2012, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide each employee of an Acquired Corporation who is
continuously employed by an Acquired Corporation from the date hereof through
December 31, 2011 with an annual bonus for 2011 pursuant to the terms of the
Companys Executive Officer Bonus Plan or the Companys Employee Bonus Plan,
as applicable, in effect as of the date hereof in the amounts provided on Part
6.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any person who is an employee of
an Acquired Corporation on the date hereof but who is terminated without cause
prior to the earlier of the date on which 2011 annual bonus payments are made
or January 15, 2012, shall receive, upon such termination, an annual bonus in
the amount provided on Part 6.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent is under no obligation to continue
the employment of any employee of the Acquired Corporations.

6.5 Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") will cause each Employee Plan and Company
Employment Agreement pursuant to which consideration is payable to any
officer, director or employee who is a holder of any security of the Company
(each a " _Compensation Arrangement_ ") to be approved by the Compensation
Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

6.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Acquired Corporations existing in
favor of those Persons who are directors and officers of any Acquired
Corporation as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as
provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Acquired
Corporations (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided
in the indemnification agreements between the Acquired Corporations and said
Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the
forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives
prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall be
observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest
extent available under Delaware law for a period of six years from the
Effective Time, and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to
such indemnification rights within such six-year period shall continue to be
subject to this Section 6.6(a) and the indemnification rights provided under
this Section 6.6(a) until disposition of such claim.

 



44 (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation (together with its
successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of an Acquired Corporation against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified
Person as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation, to the extent
arising out of or pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under
any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated herein. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons
in connection with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to
be indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.6(b) within fifteen days after
receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the
execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings to repay
such advanced costs and expenses as required under appropriate circumstances.

 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of
this Agreement in the form made available by the Company to Parent or
Parents Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement on terms with
respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than the
existing policy or, prior to the Effective Time the Company may purchase a
six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy; _provided, however_ , that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend (and
prior to the Effective Time the Company shall not expend) an amount in excess
of 250% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with respect to
such current policy, it being understood that if the aggregate amount payable
for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount.

(d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are
(i) intended to be

 



45  for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. This Section 6.6 may
not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time without
the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

6.7 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any securityholder litigation against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, and the right to consult on
the settlement with respect to such securityholder litigation, and the
Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and, no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed with
respect to any such settlement that would not alter the terms of the
Transactions).

6.8 Additional Agreements.

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and
make effective the other Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each party to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings (if any)
and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in

to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the
Merger. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such

be mutually agreed by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent and the
Company shall obtain prior written consent from each other before issuing any
press release, having any communication with the press (whether or not for
attribution) or making any other public statement, or scheduling any press
conference or conference call with investors or analysts, with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing each party
may, without such consultation or consent, (a) make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and
make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements approved by the other party, and (b) issue any such press release
or make any such public announcement or statement as may be required by Legal
Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in connection

the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company and the members of their respective boards of directors will grant

contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act
to eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions

the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided,
however,_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement

payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and such party has not cured such
failure within ten days after having received notice thereof;

not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f)
if the failure to commence the Offer on or prior to the seventh business day

be performed by the Company at or prior to the seventh business day after the
public announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the date of
termination of the Offer, as applicable;

 



48 (g) by either Parent or the Company if the acceptance for payment of Shares

(i) by Parent at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares

failure to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on
the part of the Company shall have occurred that would cause a failure of the
conditions in (2)(a), (b) or (c) of Annex I to exist; _provided, however_ ,
that, for purposes of this Section 8.1(i), if such a breach is curable by the
Company within 60 days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such
breach and the Company is continuing to exercise its reasonable best efforts
to cure such breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(i) on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain
uncured for a period of 60 days commencing on the date that Parent gives the
Company notice of such breach or (ii) any of the Acquired Corporations shall
have on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date that is 60
days after the date of this Agreement (A) enrolled, recruited (other than

exercise its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may
not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(j) on account of such
breach unless such breach shall remain uncured for a period of 60 days

under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege

9.10 Cooperation. The Company agrees to cooperate fully with Parent and to
execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and
instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by
Parent to evidence or reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement. 

9.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

9.12 Obligation of Parent. Parent shall ensure that each of Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a timely
basis each of the covenants, obligations and liabilities of Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation under this Agreement, and Parent shall be jointly and
severally liable with Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation for the due and
timely performance and satisfaction of each of said covenants, obligations
and liabilities.

9.13 Guarantee. Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Company, as the primary obligor and not merely as surety,
the due and punctual observance, payment, performance and discharge of the
obligations of Parent and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (the
_"Obligations"_ ). If Parent or Purchaser fails to pay or perform the
Obligations when due, then all of the Guarantors liabilities to the Company
hereunder in respect of such Obligations shall, at the Companys option,
become immediately due and payable and the Company may at any time and from
time to time take any and all actions available hereunder or under applicable
law to enforce and collect the Obligations from the Guarantor. In
furtherance 

 



54  of the foregoing, Guarantor acknowledges that the Company may, in its sole
discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions against the
Guarantor for the full amount of the Obligations, regardless of whether any
action is brought against Parent. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Guarantor hereby expressly and unconditionally waives any and all rights or
defenses arising by reason of any law, promptness, diligence, notice of the
acceptance of this guarantee and of the Obligation, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
the Obligation incurred and all other notices of any kind. The Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set
forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits. 

9.14 Construction.

singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders.

(b) The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied
in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather

"Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes or Schedules to this
Agreement.
