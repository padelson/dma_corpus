shall have been fulfilled.

   
---|---|---

  |  

Each of the Purchaser and the Unilever Parents (so far as within their power

activities or assets of the Companies or the Sanex Perimeter, the Purchaser
shall offer, accept and agree to any such Undertaking as may be necessary to
obtain satisfaction or fulfilment of the Condition in Clause 4.1(A) as rapidly
as possible, to the extent consistent with the Commission's decision of 17

Assumed Business Contract as agent for or sub contractor to such Business
Seller or other member of the Unilever Group and indemnify the Unilever
Parents (on behalf of the relevant Business Seller) against any cost, loss or
expense incurred by any member of the Unilever Group in respect of such
performance or, if the relevant Assumed Business Contract prohibits the
relevant Designated Purchaser from so acting as agent or sub contractor, such
Business Seller or other member of the Unilever Group shall, at the expense of
the Purchaser and to the extent that such Business Seller or other member of
the Unilever Group is able and the relevant Assumed Business Contract permits,
do all such acts and things as the relevant Designated Purchaser may
reasonably require to enable due performance of such Assumed Business Contract
and to provide for the relevant Designated Purchaser the benefits, subject to
the burdens, of the Assumed Business Contract, and the relevant Designated
Purchaser shall indemnify the Unilever Parents (on behalf of the relevant
Business Seller) against any cost, loss or expense incurred by any member of
the Unilever Group in respect of all such acts and things. For this purpose,
it shall not be reasonable to require any Business Seller or other relevant

is not obtained within 12 months after the Completion Date; or

and the procedure set out in this Clause does not enable the benefit of any
Assumed Business Contract to be enjoyed in all material respects by the
Purchaser or another member of the Purchaser\'s Group after the Completion
Date, then the Business Seller and the Purchaser shall use all reasonable
efforts to achieve an alternative solution by which the relevant Designated
Purchaser shall receive the benefit of the relevant Assumed Business Contract
and assume the associated obligations (provided that no member of the Unilever
Group shall be obliged to make any commitment, incur any liability or make any
payment for that purpose).

discharge in full of any Assurance with respect to guarantees howsoever
structured given at any time by any member of the Unilever Group to any person
in respect of any obligation or liability of any Company (including any given
in connection with the Sara Lee SPA) or in respect of any Assumed Business
Liability and the Purchaser\'s assumption of, and the substitution of the
Purchaser as the primary obligor in respect of, each such Assurance, in each
case on a non-recourse basis to the members of the Unilever Group. Pending
such release and discharge, the Purchaser hereby agrees with the Unilever
Parents (on behalf of itself and each other member of the Unilever Group) that
it will assume and pay and discharge when due, and (on behalf of itself and/or
the relevant Designated Purchaser) indemnify the Unilever Parents against any
cost, loss or expense incurred by any member of the Unilever Group in respect
of, all such Assurances with respect to guarantees.

Each of the Unilever Parents, for itself and its successors and assigns,
covenants that, at any time and from time to time on or after Completion, it

acknowledgements or take such other action as the Purchaser may reasonably
request in order to effect the release and discharge in full of any Assurance
with respect to guarantees given by any Company to any person in respect of
any obligation or liability of any member of the Unilever Group (other than a
liability of a Business Seller in respect of the Business), and shall procure
the assumption of, and the substitution of an appropriate member of the
Unilever Group as the primary obligor in respect of, each such Assurance with
respect to guarantees on a non-recourse basis to the Purchaser\'s Group.
Pending such release and discharge, the Unilever Parents hereby agree with the
Purchaser (on behalf of themselves and the relevant Company) that they will
assume and pay and discharge when due, and (on behalf of the relevant Share
Seller) indemnify the relevant Designated Purchaser against any cost, loss or
expense incurred by the relevant Company in respect of, all such Assurances

20.1

 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

The parties intend that the contracts of employment of the Business Employees
will have effect from (and including) the Completion Date, as if originally
made between each Business Employee and the relevant member of the Purchaser's
Group.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

Prior to Completion, the Unilever Parents shall, or shall cause the applicable
member of the Unilever Group to, terminate the employment of six Company

20.2

  |  

This Clause 20.2 does not apply in circumstances where Clause 20.12 applies.
If the contract of employment of any Business Employee terminates or is found
or alleged not to have effect after Completion as if originally made with the
Purchaser or another member of the Purchaser\'s Group as a consequence of the
sale and purchase of the Business Assets other than by virtue of mandatory
provisions of applicable legislation relating to the transfer of undertakings,
the Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group)
agrees that:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

in consultation with the Unilever Parents, it will, within five Business Days
of being so requested (as long as the request is made no later than 10
Business Days after the Unilever Parents become aware of such finding or
allegation and, in any event, within the period of three months after
Completion), make to that Business Employee an offer in writing to employ him
under a new contract of employment subject to, and to take effect upon, the
termination referred to below; and

  |  

the offer to be made will be on such terms and conditions as are consistent
with the Purchaser\'s undertakings in Clauses 20.7 and 20.8.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

Upon such offer being made (or at any time after the expiry of the five
Business Days if the offer is not made as requested), the relevant member of
the Unilever Group shall, where legally possible, terminate the employment of
the Business Employee concerned (save where already terminated). The Purchaser
shall (on behalf of itself and/or the relevant Designated Purchaser) indemnify
the Unilever Parents (on behalf of the relevant members of the Unilever Group)
against all liabilities arising from the employment of that employee after
Completion until such termination (up to a maximum period of three months),
and against all liabilities arising from the termination of employment of that
employee.

  


 

  

    

20.3

  |  

This Clause 20.3 does not apply in circumstances where Clause 20.12 applies.
If the contract of employment of any person who is immediately prior to
Completion employed by a member of the Unilever Group (other than a Business
Employee and a Company Employee) is found or alleged to have effect after
Completion as if originally made with the Purchaser or another member of the
Purchaser\'s Group as a consequence of the sale and purchase of the Business
Assets, the Unilever Parents (on behalf of the relevant member of the Unilever
Group) agree that:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

in consultation with the Purchaser, they will, within five Business Days of
being so requested (as long as the request is made no later than ten Business
Days after the Purchaser (or such member of the Purchaser\'s Group) becomes
aware of such finding or allegation and, in any event, within the period of
three months after Completion), procure that a member of the Unilever Group
makes to that employee an offer in writing to employ him under a new contract
of employment subject to, and to take effect upon, the termination referred to
below; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

the offer to be made will be on the same terms and conditions as were provided
to that employee immediately before Completion.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

Upon such offer being made (or at any time after the expiry of the five
Business Days if the offer is not made as requested), the relevant member of
the Purchaser\'s Group shall, where legally possible, terminate the employment
of the employee concerned. The Unilever Parents (on behalf of the relevant
member of the Unilever Group) shall indemnify each member of the Purchaser\'s
Group against all liabilities arising from the employment of that employee
after Completion until such termination (up to a maximum period of three
months), and against all liabilities arising from the termination of
employment of that employee.

  


 

  

    

20.4

  |  

The Purchaser has provided or will provide (as the case may be) the Unilever
Parents with such information reasonably requested in writing by the Unilever
Parents to enable them to comply with any obligations to inform, consult or
notify any person about the matters contemplated by this Agreement in so far
as it relates to any Employee to the extent required by local law and within
the relevant time limits imposed by local law. The obligations of this Clause
20.4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Unilever Parents.

20.5

  |  

The Purchaser shall (on behalf of itself and the relevant Designated
Purchaser) indemnify the Unilever Parents (on behalf of the relevant members
of the Unilever Group) against any claim in respect of any resignation by an
Employee, or individual who would have been an Employee but for the
termination of his employment before Completion, in circumstances where an
action by the Purchaser or a member of the Purchaser\'s Group directly gives
rise to a claim of constructive dismissal or anticipatory constructive
dismissal.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

20.6

  |  

The provisions of Clauses 20.7 and 20.8 are to apply to the Employees only for
so long as the Employees continue in the employment of any member of the
Purchaser\'s Group. This undertaking does not constitute a guarantee that the
Employees will continue to be employed following Completion and any
obligations under this Clause 20.6 immediately shall cease with respect to an
Employee upon the termination of such Employee's employment.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

20.7

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

If the employment of any Employee is terminated within 3 years of the
Completion Date, the Purchaser shall procure that there shall be provided in
respect of such Employee redundancy and severance policies and benefits
(whether contractual or otherwise and giving due credit to the Employees for
any additional service or earnings from the Completion Date onwards) in such a
manner as to be no less favourable, taken as a whole, than those applicable in
respect of the particular Employee immediately prior to the Completion Date,
to the extent such policies and benefits are comprised in the Data Room and/or
described in the Disclosure Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Clause 20.7(A) shall be construed as requiring the Purchaser or any
member of the Purchaser's Group to continue to employ any Employee during such
period from the Completion Date or thereafter.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

This Clause 20.7 does not apply to rights to Retirement Benefits which are
dealt with under Schedule 7 (Pensions).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

The Unilever Parents shall provide or shall cause to be provided to any member
of the Purchaser's Group such information reasonably requested in writing by
any member of the Purchaser's Group to enable the Purchaser to comply with its
obligations in this Clause 20.7.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

20.8

  |  

Without prejudice to Clause 20.7, the Purchaser shall procure that for a
period of 3 years following the Completion Date, Employees who continue to be
employed shall be employed on terms and conditions (whether contractual or
otherwise and including, without limitation, any related to length of service)
which are no less favourable taken as a whole in respect of each Employee than
those which apply in respect of each Employee immediately prior to the
Completion Date, to the extent such terms and conditions are comprised in the
Data Room and/or described in the Disclosure Letter. This undertaking does not
constitute a guarantee that the Employees will continue to be employed
following Completion and any obligations under this Clause 20.8 immediately
shall cease with respect to an Employee upon the termination of such
Employee's employment. This Clause 20.8 does not apply to rights to Retirement
Benefits which are dealt with under Schedule 7 (Pensions). The Unilever
Parents shall provide or shall cause to be provided to any member of the
Purchaser's Group such information reasonably requested in writing by any
member of the Purchaser's Group to enable Purchaser to comply with its
obligations in this Clause 20.8.

20.9

  |  

The Purchaser\'s agreement to the provisions of Clauses 20.7 and 20.8 is given
by the Purchaser on the express understanding that, if the Purchaser is in
breach of any such provisions, the Unilever Parents may, at their absolute
discretion, and without limitation, seek to procure compliance with such
provisions by the Purchaser by applying to the court for damages and/or
specific performance.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

20.10

  |  

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Clause 20 are without
prejudice to the operation of any rule of law in relation to, or contractual
term of, the terms and conditions of employment of the Employees.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

20.11

  |  

If any Business Employee or Company Employee requires a work permit or
employment pass or other approval (in this Clause "Permits") for his
employment to continue after Completion, the Purchaser undertakes to use its
reasonable endeavours to procure that any necessary applications are promptly
made and to use its reasonable efforts to secure the necessary Permits and the
provisions of Clause 38 (Further Assurance) shall apply in relation to the
continued employment of Employees and (if they are Business Employees or
otherwise as necessary) their transfer to another employer after Completion.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

20.12

  |  

The Unilever Parents shall procure that, upon and from the termination of the
Supply Agreements (whether absolutely or in part), the relevant Unilever
Supplier (as defined therein) shall, where such termination has the effect of
transferring the employment of any employee of that Unilever Supplier (or its
holding company, subsidiary or subsidiary of its holding company) to any
member of the Purchaser\'s Group (the "Purchaser Recipient"), indemnify the
Purchaser Recipient against any liability which results from the termination
by the Purchaser Recipient of the employment of any such employee on or
immediately after such transfer takes place or the Purchaser Recipient
becoming aware that such transfer has taken place.

(A)

  |  

after the Completion Date shall be borne or discharged by the Purchaser; and

   
---|---|---

on or before the Completion Date shall be borne or discharged by the Unilever
Parents.

20.14

  |  

The Purchaser (or members of the Purchaser's Group having assumed the relevant
contractual obligation to do so in connection with the sale of the Business
Assets) undertakes to the Unilever Parents to procure that each relevant
member of the Purchaser's Group shall pay any AIP (2011) entitlements, Sanex
Incentives Scheme and Higher Tiered Bonus Scheme entitlements payable or which
become payable to any Employees in accordance with their respective terms, as
and when they fall due for payment following Completion. In relation to the
AIP (Pre Closing Proportion) and the Sanex Incentives Scheme and the Higher
Tiered Bonus Scheme entitlements, to the extent any such amount is subject to
the discretion of any party or subject to performance criteria, then the
Unilever Parents shall notify the Purchaser of the relevant amount to be
payable under this Clause. The Unilever Parents shall (on behalf of themselves
and on behalf of any other relevant member of the Unilever Group) indemnify
the Purchaser (on behalf of the relevant Designated Purchaser or Company)
against the AIP (Pre Closing Proportion) and the Sanex Incentives Scheme and
the Higher Tiered Bonus Scheme entitlements, in each case when paid to the
Employees.

the basis that any reference in the Warranties, whether express or implied, to
the date of this Agreement is substituted by a reference to the Completion
Date (or such other date, as applicable).

   
---|--- 
 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

    

23.3

  |  

In the absence of fraud or wilful or fraudulent concealment, the liability of
the Unilever Parents under or in relation to the Warranties shall be limited
as set out in Schedule 3.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

23.4

  |  

Any payment made by the Unilever Parents (on behalf of themselves or the
Business Sellers or the Share Sellers) in respect of any claim under the
Warranties or any indemnity or covenant to pay given under this Agreement or
under the Tax Covenant shall, if it is specifically attributable to a Company
or Business Asset, be treated as a repayment of and adjustment to that part of
the Final Cash Consideration that is attributable to that Company or that
Business Asset, and, otherwise, shall be treated as an adjustment to that part
of the Final Cash Consideration that the Unilever Parents and the Purchaser
shall reasonably agree is appropriate.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

23.5

  |  

Subject and without prejudice to Clause 39, the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that it has not relied upon any representations, warranties or
statements made by any member of the Unilever Group or any of their affiliates
or representatives that are not set forth in the Principal Transaction
Documents.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

23.6

  |  

Without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Purchaser for breach of
the Warranties, the only remedies not available to the Purchaser shall be
rescission or termination of this Agreement for any such breach of Warranty.

23.7

  |  

The Unilever Parents undertake that, if any claim is made against any of them
by the Purchaser in connection with the sale of the Shares and the Business
Assets to the Purchaser, they shall not make any claim against any Company
Employee on whom they may have relied before agreeing to any terms of this
Agreement or the Tax Covenant or authorising any statement in the Disclosure
Letter.

23.8

  |  

Each of the Warranties shall be construed as a separate and independent
warranty and, except where expressly provided to the contrary, shall not be
limited or restricted, or widened or extended by reference to or inference

23.9

  |  

If an Indemnified Material Adverse Effect occurs prior to Completion, the
Purchaser may on or before Completion give a notice to the Unilever Parents
that it believes that such an Indemnified Material Adverse Effect has
occurred. Completion shall take place at the time specified in this Agreement
notwithstanding the giving of such a notice and notwithstanding the alleged
occurrence of an Indemnified Material Adverse Effect. The Purchaser shall have
no right of rescission or termination in respect of the alleged Indemnified
Material Adverse Effect. Upon receipt of such a notice, the Unilever Parents
shall have a period of 30 days to remedy the Indemnified Material Adverse
Effect. In exercising their right to remedy, the Unilever Parents shall ensure
that they do not interfere with the actions taken by the Purchaser in response
to the Indemnified Material Adverse Effect or otherwise affect the Purchaser's
ability to mitigate or exacerbate the effect of the Indemnified Material
Adverse Effect. If the Unilever Parents fail to fully remedy such Indemnified
Material Adverse Effect (and otherwise make the Purchaser whole for all
losses, liabilities and expenses in relation to the Indemnified Material
Adverse Effect) during such 30 day period then the Unilever Parents shall be
liable to pay to the Purchaser and shall indemnify the Purchaser for all
losses, liabilities and expenses arising out of, resulting from or
attributable to the Indemnified Material Adverse Effect (or the failure fully
to remedy), including the diminution in value of the Sanex Perimeter which
shall be the amount by which the value of the Sanex Perimeter has been reduced
as referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of "Indemnified Material
Adverse Effect" and after taking account of any remedial actions. The
Purchaser expressly reserves the right to bring an Action in respect of an
Indemnified Material Adverse Effect. Any claim for indemnification in respect
of an Indemnified Material Adverse Effect shall not be a Claim for the
purposes of this Agreement and it is agreed that the limitations, obligations
and restrictions in Schedule 3 applicable to other indemnified matters shall
not apply to any claim for indemnification in respect of an Indemnified
Material Adverse Effect other than paragraph 13 of Schedule 3 which shall be
applicable and Clause 36 shall not apply to any claim for indemnification in
respect of an Indemnified Material Adverse Effect. The Purchaser shall use
reasonable efforts to mitigate the Indemnified Material Adverse Effect
provided that the cost of taking such steps shall be taken into account in
determining the quantum of any diminution in value.

The Unilever Parents shall (at the Purchaser\'s expense) use all reasonable
endeavours to exercise their rights under the Sara Lee SPA to take copies of

requires.

(A)

  |  

The Unilever Parents shall procure that each Business Seller shall, where
reasonably requested to do so by the Purchaser and subject to the
reimbursement by the Purchaser of the Business Sellers\' reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, assist the Purchaser with the preparation of data reasonably
required for compliance with any reporting requirements of any stock exchange
or securities or other regulatory authority under any applicable law, rule or

The Purchaser shall, with effect from Completion, procure the grant to the
Unilever Group of an irrevocable licence (with the right to sub-license) to
use each Business Mould relating to a specific product (or products) from
Completion until the date falling six months after the Supply Agreement is
terminated in relation to supply of such specific product (or products) and
the Purchaser shall not take any action (and shall procure that no member of
the Purchaser\'s Group takes any action) which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect such right of use (including, without limitation, relocating
the Business Moulds) without the prior consent of the Unilever Parents (which

31.1

  |  

The Purchaser agrees to enter into an agreement at Completion which will
effect the transfer by novation of the SA Manufacturing Agreement from a

accordance with the relevant Sale of Products Agreement) the Purchaser (or
relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group) agrees to pay in cleared funds to
the Unilever Parents at least three Business Days before any payment is due by
a member of the Unilever Group to Sara Lee under the terms of the SA
Manufacturing Agreement an amount equal to such payment plus a mark up of 3.5
per cent.

31.2

  |  

The Unilever Parents shall procure the manufacture, packaging and supply of
products under the Sanex mark in Indonesia and for supply into Malaysia to the
Purchaser (or any member of the Purchaser\'s Group) (excluding any products
which at the date of this Agreement are supplied by a third party pursuant to
any Assumed Business Contract or any agreement to which a Company is party) on
terms that are terminable by either party on six months\' notice in accordance
with the terms of the Supply Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

31.3

  |  

The Unilever Parents shall procure the manufacture, packaging and supply of
products under the Sanex mark in each European Jurisdiction to the Purchaser

the Supply Agreement or otherwise:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

the Unilever Parents reserve the right to terminate the manufacture and
packaging of any such products at the relevant production facility and to
source production from elsewhere provided that:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

subject to (ii), this does not cause a material increase in the price that
would be payable by the Purchaser (or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s
Group) for the manufacture, packaging and supply of such products (taken as a
whole); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

whilst the Purchaser acknowledges that the price payable for the manufacture,
packaging and supply of certain products is likely to be higher if the
Unilever Parents relocate the production of such products from the facility in
Santiga to the facility in Compiegne, the Unilever Parents will use all
reasonable endeavours to minimise the amount of any such increase.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

as soon as reasonably practicable after the production of any product has
terminated in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

the Unilever Parents shall transfer to the Purchaser (or designated member of
the Purchaser\'s Group) all contracts (whether or not relating exclusively to
the Sanex Perimeter) pursuant to which any third party supplies raw materials
or packaging to the Unilever Group but only to the extent that the same relate
to the manufacture and packaging of that product under the Supply Agreement,
and the provisions of Clauses 13.3 and 13.4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to
the transfer of contracts under this sub-clause save that references to
Completion shall be deemed to be references to the date that the supply of
that product terminates under the Supply Agreement; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

where the product is the Sanex deodorant roll-on units, the Unilever Parents
shall procure, at the Purchaser\'s cost, that the Deodorant Product Line for
such units is dismantled (under the supervision of an authorised
representative of the Purchaser's Group) and transported to a location
specified by the Purchaser whereupon it shall be owned by the Purchaser (and,
for this purpose, the Purchaser shall specify such location to the Unilever
Parents no later than five Business Days after the Unilever Parents have
requested them to do so).

ownership of the Bath and Shower Product Line from Sara Lee, the Unilever
Parents shall (at their own cost) dismantle (under the supervision of an
authorised representative of the Purchaser's Group) the production line for
such units and shall procure, at the Purchaser\'s cost, that such production
line is transported to a location specified by the Purchaser whereupon this
production line shall be owned by the Purchaser (and, for this purpose, the
Purchaser shall specify such location to the Unilever Parents no later than
five Business Days after the Unilever Parents have requested them to do so).

PURCHASER\'S GUARANTEE

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

32.1

  |  

The Purchaser\'s Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
to each of the Unilever Parents and each member of the Unilever Group the
full, due and punctual performance and observation by the Purchaser (or the
relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group) of all the Assurances given by the
Purchaser or a member of the Purchaser\'s Group in or pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or any documents entered into hereunder, the Tax Covenant and
each other Purchaser\'s Completion Document, and the Supply Agreement
(together, the "Guaranteed Agreements"). The guarantee under this Clause 32
shall not be released or diminished by any variation of the terms of any
Guaranteed Agreement (whether or not such variation is agreed to by the
Purchaser\'s Guarantor) or by any forbearance, neglect or delay in seeking
performance of the obligations hereby imposed or any granting of time for such
performance.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

32.2

  |  

If and whenever the Purchaser (or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group)
defaults for any reason whatsoever in the performance of any Assurance given
or expressed to be given in or pursuant to the terms of any Guaranteed
Agreement the Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall forthwith upon demand
unconditionally perform (or procure performance of) and/or satisfy (or procure
satisfaction of) the relevant Assurance so that the same benefits shall be
conferred on each of the Unilever Parents or the relevant one of them as would
have been received if such Assurance had been duly performed and/or satisfied
by the Purchaser (or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group).

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

32.3

  |  

This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and accordingly is to remain in
force until all the Assurances of the Purchaser (or relevant member of the
Purchaser\'s Group) referred to in Clause 32.1 above shall have been performed
and/or satisfied regardless of the legality, validity or enforceability of any
provisions of any Guaranteed Agreement and notwithstanding the winding up,
liquidation, dissolution or other incapacity of the Purchaser (or relevant
member of the Purchaser\'s Group) or any change in the status, control or
ownership of the Purchaser (or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group).
This guarantee is in addition to and without limiting and not in limitation of
or substitution for any rights or security which either of the Unilever
Parents may now or hereafter have or hold for the performance and observance
of the Assurance of the Purchaser (or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s
Group) given in or pursuant to any Guaranteed Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

32.4

  |  

As a separate and independent stipulation, the Purchaser\'s Guarantor agrees
that any Assurance expressed to be given by the Purchaser or relevant member
of the Purchaser\'s Group (including, without limitation, any moneys expressed
to be payable in respect of any Guaranteed Agreement) which may not be
enforceable against or recoverable from the Purchaser (or relevant member of
the Purchaser\'s Group) by reason of any legal limitation, disability or
incapacity on or of the relevant Purchaser or any fact or circumstance (other
than any limitation imposed by such Guaranteed Agreement) shall nevertheless
be enforceable against the Purchaser\'s Guarantor as though the same had been
incurred by the Purchaser\'s Guarantor and the Purchaser\'s Guarantor was the
sole or principal obligor in respect thereof and/or shall be performed or paid
by the Purchaser\'s Guarantor on demand.

32.5

  |  

All sums payable by the Purchaser\'s Guarantor to either of the Unilever
Parents or to any member of the Unilever Group under this Clause 32 shall be
paid free and clear of all deductions or withholdings whatsoever, save only as
may be required by law, and the provisions of Clauses 33 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to any payment made by the Purchaser\'s Guarantor as contemplated by
this Agreement but with any modifications required to give effect to this
Clause 32.5.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

32.6

  |  

If any sum paid by the Purchasers\' Guarantor to either of the Unilever
Parents or to any member of the Unilever Group under this Clause 32 gives rise
to a liability to Tax in the hands of the relevant Unilever Parent or any
member of the Unilever Group in an amount which is greater than the liability
to Tax that would have arisen in the hands of the relevant Unilever Parent if
the Purchaser (or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group) had discharged in
full the amount which has given rise to the payment by the Purchasers\'
Guarantor (the "Original Obligation"), then the Purchasers\' Guarantor will
pay to the relevant Unilever Parent or relevant member of the Unilever Group,
in addition to its other obligations under this Clause, such amount as leaves
the relevant Unilever Parent or relevant member of the Unilever Group in the
same after Tax position as that in which it would have been if the relevant
Purchaser had discharged the Original Obligation in full.

33.

  |  

PAYMENTS

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

33.1

  |  

Except to the extent otherwise set out in this Agreement, any payment to be
made by any party (whether paid on its own behalf or on behalf of the Share
Sellers, a Business Seller or a Designated Purchaser, as the case may be), in
each case a "Payer", under this Agreement to another party (whether to be
received on its own behalf or on behalf of the Share Sellers, a Business
Seller or a Designated Purchaser, as the case may be), in each case a
"Recipient", shall be made in full without any set-off, restriction or
condition (whether for or on account of any counterclaim or otherwise) and
without, and free and clear of, any deduction or withholding whatsoever (save
only as required by law).

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

33.2

  |  

If any deductions or withholdings are required by the law of the jurisdiction
of which a Payer is resident or from which it makes a payment under this
Agreement to be made from any payment under this Agreement (other than any
such deductions or withholdings required to be made as a result of the failure
of a Recipient that would otherwise be entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of such deductions or withholdings to complete any procedural
formalities establishing such Recipient's entitlement thereto), the Payer
shall also be obliged to pay to the Recipient such sum as will, after such
deductions or withholdings have been made, leave the Recipient with the same
amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such
requirement to make such deduction or withholding (or any deduction or
withholding from that further sum due).

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

33.3

  |  

This sub-Clause applies if a Payer makes a payment under Clause 32.5 or Clause
33.2 above (a "Tax Payment") in favour of a Recipient. In this case, the
Unilever Parents and the Purchaser shall procure that:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

the Recipient notifies the Payer if the Recipient obtains a refund of Tax or
obtains and uses a credit against Tax on its overall net income (a "Tax
Credit") which the Recipient is able to identify as attributable to that Tax
Payment or the deduction or withholding to which it relates;

   
---|---|--- 
 

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

the Recipient reimburses to the Payer the amount determined by the Recipient
to be the proportion of the refund of Tax or Tax Credit that, if it is paid
back to the Payer, will leave the Recipient (after that reimbursement) in no
better or worse position in respect of its Tax liabilities than it would have
been in if no Tax Payment had been required; provided that there will only be
an obligation under this paragraph to the extent the Recipient can make the
reimbursement without there being, in the opinion of the Recipient, any
adverse consequences to the Recipient (other than the reimbursement itself);
and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

the Recipient is under no obligation by virtue of this sub-Clause 33.3 to
disclose any information regarding its Tax affairs and computations. This sub-
Clause 33.3 does not affect the right of the Recipient to arrange its Tax
affairs as it thinks fit.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

33.4

  |  

If a Payer is required to make an increased payment under Clause 33.2 in
circumstances where if that payment were made to either another member of the
Purchaser's Group, a Target Company or the Unilever Group (in each case
incorporated and resident in the jurisdiction in which the relevant tax
liability arose), either no payment or a smaller payment would be required to
be made under this Agreement, the Payer shall, if it obtains the prior written
consent of the Recipient (not, taking into account all the circumstances, to
be unreasonably withheld), be permitted to pay such sum (if any) to either
that Target Company or that other member of the Purchaser's Group or the
Unilever Group, as applicable.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

33.5

  |  

The Unilever Parents (on behalf of itself, the Business Sellers, Share Sellers
and all other members of the Unilever Group) and the Purchaser (on behalf of
itself, the Designated Purchasers and all other members of the Purchaser's
Group) shall use all reasonable endeavours to evaluate before Completion
whether any withholdings or deductions on account of Tax may be required by
law to be made from any payments made under the Transitional Services
Agreement, the Supply Agreement and the Sale of Products Agreement. If such
withholdings and deductions may be required to be made, the parties shall use
all reasonable endeavours to restructure the transactions set out in the
Transitional Services Agreement, the Supply Agreement and the Sale of Products
Agreement so that no, or reduced, withholdings or deductions would have to be
made, provided that such restructuring would not prejudice the interests of
any member of either the Unilever Group or the Purchaser's Group.

EFFECT OF COMPLETION

Save as otherwise provided herein, any provision of this Agreement or of any
other document referred to herein which is capable of being performed after
but which has not been performed at or before Completion and all Warranties
contained in or entered into pursuant to this Agreement shall (subject to
Schedule 3) remain in full force and effect notwithstanding Completion.

35.2

  |  

If any liability of one of the Unilever Parents is, or becomes, illegal,
invalid or unenforceable in any respect, that shall not affect or impair the
liabilities of the other of the Unilever Parents under this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

35.3

  |  

Save as expressly provided in this Agreement, any obligation of the Unilever
Parents under this Agreement to take any action shall be satisfied by any
member of the Unilever Group taking such action. Any right of the Unilever
Parents under this Agreement may be exercised by either of them.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

35.4

  |  

The undertakings given by the Purchaser to, and agreements made by the
Purchaser with, the Unilever Parents in this Agreement are given and made to
and with the Unilever Parents for themselves and as trustees for the Share
Sellers or the relevant Business Seller.

35.5

The undertakings given by the Unilever Parents to, and agreements made by the
Unilever Parents with, the Purchaser in this Agreement are given and made to

36.1

  |  

No delay or omission on the part of any party to this Agreement in exercising
any right, power or remedy provided by law or under this Agreement or any
other documents referred to in it shall impair such right, power or remedy or
operate as a waiver thereof or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

36.2

  |  

The single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy provided under
this Agreement or any document referred to in it shall not preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

36.3

  |  

The rights and remedies of each party under or pursuant to this Agreement are
cumulative, may be exercised as often as such party considers appropriate and
are in addition to its rights and remedies under general law.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

36.4

  |  

Upon any person (the "Indemnified Person") becoming aware of any assessment,
claim, action or demand of a third party (a "Third Party Claim") against it
which gives rise to any claim for indemnification under this Agreement (not
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tax Covenant), the Indemnified
Person shall:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

as soon as practicable notify the person from whom indemnification is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") by written notice as soon as it appears to the
Indemnified Person that any Third Party Claim received by or coming to the
notice of the Indemnified Person may result in a claim for indemnification;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

subject to the Indemnifying Party indemnifying the Indemnified Person against
any liability, cost, damage or expense which may be incurred thereby, take
such action and give such information and access to personnel, premises,
chattels, documents and records to the Indemnifying Party and their
professional advisers as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to require any relevant company (being a
member of the Purchaser\'s Group where the Indemnified Person is a member of
the Purchaser\'s Group or a member of the Unilever Group where the Indemnified
Person is a member of the Unilever Group) to take such action and give such
reasonable information and assistance in order to avoid, dispute, resist,
mitigate, settle, compromise, defend or appeal any claim in respect thereof or
adjudication with respect thereto;

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  


 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

allow the Indemnifying Party to take the sole conduct of such actions as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably deem appropriate in connection with any such
assessment or claim in the name of the Indemnified Person or any such relevant
company referred to above and in that connection the Indemnified Person shall
give or cause to be given to the Indemnifying Party all such assistance as it
may reasonably require in avoiding, disputing, resisting, settling,
compromising, defending or appealing any such claim and shall instruct such
legal or other professional advisors as the Indemnifying Party may nominate to
act on behalf of the Indemnified Person or any relevant company, as
appropriate, but to act in accordance with the Indemnifying Party\'s
instructions PROVIDED THAT the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
commence any legal proceedings where either:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

the Indemnified Person has validly assigned all of its rights in relation to
the relevant claim to the Indemnifying Party in a manner which entitles the
Indemnifying Party to the same benefits in respect of such rights as the
Indemnified Person had; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

where Clause 36.4(C)(i) does not apply, the Indemnifying Party has not
notified the relevant party against whom such proceedings are brought that
such proceedings are being brought at the instruction of the Indemnifying
Party;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(D)

  |  

be entitled to participate in the defence of any Third Party Claim and to
employ separate counsel to represent it at its own expense PROVIDED THAT the
Indemnifying Party shall control the defence of the Third Party Claim;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(E)

  |  

make no admission of liability, agreement, settlement or compromise with any
third party in relation to any such claim or adjudication without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(F)

  |  

take all reasonable action to mitigate any loss suffered by it in respect of
which a claim could be made for indemnification.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

36.5

  |  

The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled at any stage and in its absolute
discretion to settle any such Third Party Claim after giving reasonable
advance written notice to the Indemnified Person and provided that the
Indemnified Party is discharged in full of its liabilities under such Third
Party Claim (for the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 36.5 shall not apply with
respect to any claim under the Tax Covenant).

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

36.6

  |  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defence of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable costs and expenses (including legal expenses) incurred by the
Indemnified Person in defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party
Claim seeks any relief other than damages (including any orders, injunctions
or other equitable relief) against the Indemnified Person which the
Indemnified Person reasonably determines cannot be separated from any related
claim for damages. If such claim for other relief can be separated from the
claim for damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the
defence of the claim for damages (for the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 36.5
shall not apply with respect to any claim under the Tax Covenant).

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

36.7

  |  

If any Indemnified Person has a claim for indemnification against any
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (not including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Tax Covenant) which does not involve a Third Party Claim being
brought or alleged against such Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person may
give notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any
Indemnified Person so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have to such Indemnified
Person. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Person
within 30 Business Days following its receipt of such notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Person under this
Agreement (not including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tax Covenant) such
claim specified by the Indemnified Person in such notice shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (not
including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tax Covenant) and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Person on
demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any
portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such
claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the
Indemnifying Party has disputed its liability with respect to such claim
within the time period specified in this sub Clause, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Person shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute.

Subject to Clauses 37.3 and 37.4 below, the benefits of this Agreement shall
not be assignable except that any party may, upon giving written notice to the
others, assign the benefit of this Agreement to a member of the Unilever Group
or the Purchaser's Group, as the case may be, (a "Permitted Assignee")
provided that such assignment shall be without cost to, and shall not result
in any increased liability, or any reduction in the rights, of, any of the
other parties and further provided that if such Permitted Assignee shall
subsequently cease to be a member of the Purchaser\'s Group or the Unilever
Group, as the case may be, the original assigning party shall procure that
prior to the Permitted Assignee ceasing to be a member of the Purchaser\'s
Group or the Unilever Group, as the case may be, it shall assign so much of
the benefit of this Agreement as has been assigned to it to the party by whom
such rights were originally assigned or (upon giving further written notice to
the other parties) to another member of the Purchaser\'s Group or the Unilever
Group, as the case may be. Any purported assignment in contravention of this
Clause shall be void.

37.3

Without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 37.2 above, the parties hereby
agree that where the Purchaser assigns the benefit of this Agreement in whole

than such rights would have been had the assignment not occurred and the
liabilities of all members of the Unilever Group under this Agreement to the
Purchaser\'s Group shall be no greater than such liabilities would have been
had the assignment not occurred.

parties relating to the sale and purchase of the Business Assets and the

39.2

  |  

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees (for itself and on behalf of each other
member of the Purchaser\'s Group) with the Unilever Parents (on behalf of
themselves and each other member of the Unilever Group) that:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(A)

  |  

it does not rely on and has not been induced to enter into any of the
Transaction Documents on the basis of any Assurance (express or implied) made
or given by or on behalf of any member of the Unilever Group or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or advisers other than those
expressly set out in the Transaction Documents or, to the extent that it has
been, it has (in the absence of fraud) no rights or remedies in relation
thereto and shall make no claim in relation thereto or against such parties;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

no member of the Unilever Group, or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or advisers, has given or made any Assurance other than
those expressly set out in the Transaction Documents or, to the extent that
they have, the Purchaser hereby (for itself and on behalf of each other member
of the Purchaser\'s Group) unconditionally and irrevocably waives (in the
absence of fraud) any claim which it might otherwise have had in relation
thereto; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

any warranty or other rights which may be implied by law in any jurisdiction
in relation to the sale of the Business Assets or the Shares in such
jurisdiction shall be excluded or, if incapable of exclusion, irrevocably
waived and the Purchaser (on behalf of itself and/or the relevant Designated
Purchaser) agrees to indemnify the relevant Business Seller in respect of any
liabilities, costs, claims and expenses arising or incurred by any member of
the Unilever Group as a result of claims under any such implied warranties or
other rights by the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchaser\'s Group or
their respective successors in title (including, without limitation, any
provider of finance to the Purchaser).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

39.3

  |  

This Agreement may only be varied by a document signed by each of the parties
and expressed to be a variation to this Agreement. For this purpose, a
variation to this Agreement shall include any addition, deletion, supplement
or replacement, howsoever effected.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

39.4

  |  

To the extent that any provision of any agreement entered into for the
purposes of transferring Business Assets located in a particular jurisdiction
or country is inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement, the provision
of this Agreement shall prevail.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

39.5

  |  

Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees that it shall not,
and shall procure that no member of the Purchaser\'s Group shall, bring any
claim against the Unilever Parents or any member of the Unilever Group under
any agreement (other than the Principal Transaction Documents) entered into
for the purposes of transferring any Business Asset and/or the Shares or under
any agreement (other than the Principal Transaction Documents) which relate to
the subject matter of the Principal Transaction Documents (each an "Ancillary
Agreement").

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

39.6

  |  

If the Purchaser breaches its obligation under Clause 39.5 such that any
member of the Unilever Group incurs any liability under any Ancillary
Agreement, the Purchaser (on behalf of itself and/or the relevant Designated
Purchaser) shall indemnify the relevant Business Seller and/or Share Seller
against all liability incurred by the Unilever Parents and/or relevant members
of the Unilever Group as a result of such breach, including the difference
between:

  |  

(A)

  |

Purchaser\'s Group in respect of a claim under any Ancillary Agreement and the
relevant Principal Transaction Documents; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

the amount that the Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group
would have recovered if the Purchaser had complied with its obligation under
Clause 39.5 and brought a claim or claims under the relevant Principal
Transaction Documents (taking account of the limitations of liability set out
in such agreements and the relevant principles of English law).

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

39.7

  |  

If any member of the Unilever Group incurs any liability under any Ancillary
Agreement in respect of a claim or matter (an "Ancillary Agreement Liability")
and such a liability would not have been incurred under the relevant Principal
Transaction Documents in respect of the same claim or matter (taking account
of the limitations of liability set out in such agreements and the relevant
principles of English law), then the Purchaser shall (on behalf of itself
and/or the relevant Designated Purchaser) indemnify the Unilever Parents (on
behalf of themselves and the relevant Business Seller and/or Share Seller) for
the amount of such Ancillary Agreement Liability.

(a)

  |  

If, in respect of any matter which would give rise to a Claim, any member of
the Purchaser\'s Group is entitled to claim under any policy of insurance,
then no such matter shall be the subject of a Claim other than to notify the
Unilever Parents of such Claim unless and until the appropriate member of the
Purchaser\'s Group shall have made a claim in respect of such policies and

claim shall then reduce by the amount recovered or extinguish any such Claims

that the member of the Purchaser\'s Group concerned shall, take all reasonable
steps to enforce such recovery prior to taking action against the Unilever

(i)

  |

Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group subsequently recovers
from some other person any sum in respect of any matter giving rise to such
Claim, the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the relevant member of the
Purchaser\'s Group shall, repay to the relevant Unilever Parent the lesser of
(i) the amount paid by the Unilever Parents (or the relevant one of them) to
the Purchaser or other member of the Purchaser\'s Group and (ii) the sum
(including interest (if any) less any Tax chargeable in respect of the sum
recovered or the interest) recovered from such other person, taking account of

other member of the Purchaser\'s Group recovering that sum.

breach or other set of circumstances which gives rise to more than one Claim
or other claim under this Agreement or claim under the Tax Covenant, and for
this purpose recovery by the Purchaser or any Designated Purchaser shall be
deemed to be a recovery by each of them.

Unilever Group shall be liable for any Claim if and to the extent that the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser\'s Group is aware at the date of this
Agreement (i) of the fact, matter, event or circumstance which is the subject
matter of the Claim and (ii) that the fact, matter, event or circumstance
could reasonably be expected to amount to a Claim. For the purposes of this
paragraph 15, the knowledge of the Purchaser shall be deemed to be the actual

16.

  |

from the Purchaser in accordance with paragraph 1 in which to remedy such
breach (and the Purchaser shall, upon the request and at the cost of the
Unilever Parents, provide all reasonable assistance to the Unilever Parents to

Conduct of litigation. If the Purchaser or any Designated Purchaser receives
written notice of any claim or potential claim by a third party (a Third Party
Claim), which might reasonably result in a Non-Tax Claim being made, the
Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within 20 Business Days of it or a
Designated Purchaser receiving such notice) give notice of the Third Party
Claim to the Unilever Parents and ensure that the Unilever Parents and its
representatives are given all reasonable information and access to facilities
to investigate it, provided that any failure by the Purchaser to give such
notice to the Unilever Parents under this paragraph 18 shall not prevent any
Claim by the Purchaser or extinguish any liability of the Unilever Parents
under this Agreement but may be taken into account in calculating any such
liability of the Unilever Parents to the extent that the Unilever Parents
establish that such liability is increased by such failure.

matter of the Third Party Claim, in their view, does not give rise to a Claim,
the following shall apply:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |

Purchaser and the Draft Completion Stock Amount Statement shall be final and
binding on the Unilever Parents and the Purchaser and shall constitute the

Expert\'s determination as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment by the Expert of any amount set out in the Completion Stock Amount

fees and costs of the Expert shall be paid as to one-half by the Purchaser and
as to one-half by the Unilever Parents unless otherwise directed by the Expert
(who shall have the authority to make such direction if he deems it
equitable). The Expert may, if he decides it is necessary or desirable to do
so in his absolute discretion, refer any interpretational matter which relates
to any dispute to a leading counsel approved by the Unilever Parents and the
Purchaser and the terms of appointment of the Expert shall allow him to make
such reference.

PRINCIPAL TERMS

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

1.1

  |  

In relation to each Employee, the Purchaser shall provide or procure to be
provided Retirement Benefits in respect of Past Service which are of the same
or greater value to the Retirement Benefits that such Employee would have been
entitled to but for Completion in respect of that Employee\'s Past Service and
which shall be at least equal to the Retirement Benefits required to be
provided under the provisions governing the Relevant Plan immediately before
Completion. For the avoidance of doubt, in calculating (for the purposes of
this paragraph 1.1) the Retirement Benefits which are required under the
Relevant Plan, it shall be assumed that where the Relevant Plan provides a
Defined Benefit which is a Retirement Benefit calculated by reference to pay
at retirement, that Retirement Benefit shall continue to be paid by reference
to pay at the earlier of (i) each Employee\'s retirement and (ii) the date on
which the Employee ceases to be in pensionable service under the Relevant
Plan. Such Retirement Benefit shall be paid at the same time as the time that
the Retirement Benefit would have been paid but for Completion. The
obligations of the Purchaser under this paragraph 1.1 shall continue to apply
notwithstanding the expiry of the Protection Period.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

1.2

  |  

(A)

  |  

In relation to each Employee who, immediately prior to the Completion Date, is
accruing Retirement Benefits under a Relevant Plan which are not Defined
Benefits, the Purchaser shall provide or procure to be provided, in respect of
service during the Protection Period, employer contributions as required under
the provisions governing the Relevant Plan and which are on the same or more
favourable basis and at the same or more favourable rate as the contributions
due and payable in respect of the Relevant Plan for the benefit of that
Employee immediately prior to the Completion Date.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

In relation to each Employee who, immediately prior to the Completion Date, is
accruing Defined Benefits under a Relevant Plan, the Purchaser shall provide
or procure to be provided Retirement Benefits to be paid in respect of service
during the Protection Period which are of the same or greater value to the
Retirement Benefits that such Employee would have been entitled to but for
Completion.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

In any case, the rate of employee contributions in respect of the Purchaser\'s
Plan required during and in respect of the Protection Period under the
provisions governing the Purchaser\'s Plan shall not be higher than the rate
of employee contributions due and payable immediately prior to the Completion
Date.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

1.3

  |  

Without prejudice to paragraph 1.1, in relation to each Employee who would,
had Completion not taken place, have become entitled to a Retirement Benefit
under a Jubilee Plan during the Protection Period, the Purchaser shall provide
or procure to be provided, the same Retirement Benefit that such Employee
would have been entitled to but for Completion. That Retirement Benefit shall
be paid or provided to the relevant Employee at the same time, or earlier, as
the time that the Retirement Benefit would have become payable but for
Completion.

  |  

[RESERVED]

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

2.2

  |  

Where Retirement Benefits (whether contractual or otherwise) are provided
under a Relevant Plan or Jubilee Plan on the death, disability or involuntary
termination of employment during the Protection Period of an Employee or his
spouse, child or dependant, Retirement Benefits must be provided on such
events which occur during the Protection Period which are not materially less
favourable and which are payable in circumstances and under conditions which
are not materially less favourable to the beneficiary concerned than those
which would have applied had the death, disability or involuntary termination
of employment occurred whilst the beneficiary was a beneficiary of the
Relevant Plan or Jubilee Plan in question under the provisions of that plan in
force immediately prior to the Completion Date.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

2.3

  |

Plan in accordance with the provisions that Relevant Plan immediately before
Completion until 31 December 2011.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

2.5

employment.

Schedule 8

  

(Employees)

  


 

  

To the extent that in the Netherlands, France, Belgium or any other
jurisdiction there is a legally binding obligation imposed on any member of
the Unilever Group which requires it to inform and consult with any recognised
works council or other appointed employee representatives in that country
before implementing the terms of this Agreement, a failure of which may render
this Agreement in its current form void or inoperable, the Unilever Parents
and the Purchaser agree that:

  


 

  

    

(i)

  |  

the entering into of this Agreement is without prejudice to any legal
requirement to comply with such informing and consulting obligations before
implementing the terms of this Agreement;

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(ii)

  |  

they will cooperate with each other in good faith in order to ensure
compliance with such informing and consulting obligations before implementing
the terms of this Agreement; and

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(iii)

  |  

the Unilever Parents have not taken any binding decision concerning the
implementation of the terms of this Agreement, such binding decision being
subject to the information and consultation obligation.

Schedule 10

  

(VAT)

  


 

  

    

(A)

  |  

The Unilever Parents and the Purchaser shall use all reasonable endeavours to
procure that the supply of those Business Assets under this Agreement which
would otherwise be chargeable to VAT (but for the sale being treated, for the
purposes of applicable VAT Legislation, as a transfer of all or part of the
assets of a business as a going concern as hereinafter mentioned) and which
the Unilever Parents and the Purchaser consider should qualify as a transfer
of all or part of the assets of a business as a going concern for the purposes
of applicable VAT Legislation is so treated by the relevant Tax Authority
except that the Unilever Parents shall not be required by virtue of this sub
Clause to make any appeal to any court against any determination of the
relevant Tax Authority that that sale does not fall to be so treated.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(B)

  |  

The Purchaser:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

represents that the Designated Purchasers that are to purchase Business Assets
under this Agreement (for the purposes of this Schedule, each being a
"Designated Business Purchaser") are, or will as a result of such acquisition
of Business Assets under this Agreement become, taxable persons for the
purposes of VAT;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

undertakes to procure that each Designated Business Purchaser is either duly
registered for VAT purposes in the relevant jurisdiction or jurisdictions or a
member of a group of companies for VAT purposes of which the representative
member is duly registered for those purposes in the relevant jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, in either case by Completion; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

undertakes to inform the Unilever Parents in writing on or prior to Completion
which of the Designated Business Purchasers shall (and which shall not) upon
and immediately after Completion use the Business Assets it acquires under
this Agreement to carry on the same kind of business (whether or not as part
of any existing business of the Purchaser or such other person) as that
carried on by the relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers in relation to
those Business Assets owned by such Business Seller or Business Sellers before
Completion.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(C)

  |  

The Unilever Parents, and Purchaser, do not intend to procure that the
Business Sellers, and the Designated Purchasers, make a joint application to
the relevant Tax Authority for any Designated Purchaser to be registered for
VAT under the VAT registration number of any Business Seller pursuant to
regulation 6(1)(d) of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 and the Unilever
Parents shall request any other relevant Tax Authority to direct in accordance
with applicable VAT Legislation that it shall be entitled to retain the VAT
Records associated with such VAT registration number. The Purchaser shall
render all reasonable assistance to the Unilever Parents in connection with
such a request. Accordingly, the Unilever Parent shall be entitled to and
shall retain the VAT Records.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(D)

  |  

The Unilever Parents shall for such period as may be required by applicable
law preserve the VAT records of the Business that it is entitled to retain
pursuant to paragraph (C) and, upon being given reasonable notice by the
Purchaser or its agents, the Unilever Parents shall make those records
available to the Purchaser or its agents for inspection (during working hours)
or copying (at the Purchaser\'s expense).

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

120  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

    

(E)

  |  

If, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (A), the relevant Tax
Authority shall determine that VAT is chargeable in respect of the supply of
all or any of the Business Assets referred to in paragraph (A) under this
Agreement, the Unilever Parents shall notify the Purchaser of that
determination within 10 Business Days of its being so advised and the
Purchaser shall (on behalf of the relevant Designated Purchaser) pay to the
Unilever Parents (to hold on behalf of the relevant Business Seller or
Business Sellers) by way of additional consideration a sum equal to the amount
of VAT (together with any interest and/or penalties relating thereto)
determined by the relevant Tax Authority to be so chargeable on the later of
five Business Days after the Unilever Parents\' notifying the Purchaser of
that determination and the delivery by the Unilever Parents on behalf of the
relevant Business Seller or Business Sellers of an appropriate tax invoice for
VAT purposes.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(F)

  |  

Other than where paragraph (E) of this Schedule applies to such a supply, if
anything done under this Agreement is a supply on which VAT is chargeable, the
recipient of that supply (the "VAT Payor") shall pay to the maker of it (the
"VAT Payee") (in addition to any other amounts payable under this Agreement)
an amount equal to any VAT so chargeable for which the VAT Payee is liable to
account.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(G)

  |  

The VAT Payor shall pay that sum referred to in paragraph (F) on the later of:

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the date which is five Business Days before the last day (as notified to the
VAT Payor in writing) on which the VAT Payee can account to the relevant Tax
Authority for that VAT without incurring any interest or penalties; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

receipt by the VAT Payor of a valid tax invoice issued by the VAT Payee for
VAT purposes in respect of that supply.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(H)

  |  

[RESERVED]

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(I)

  |  

The Unilever Parents will procure that any Company which, prior to Completion,
is treated (for the purposes of applicable VAT Legislation) as constituting,
together with one or more other persons, a single taxable person in any
jurisdiction (a "VAT Group") will be excluded from that VAT Group with effect
from Completion.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

(J)

  |  

The Purchaser shall procure that each of the Companies shall promptly upon the
written request of any Unilever Parent or its agent provide such information
(including copies of documents, where relevant) reasonably requested by any
Business Seller to enable it to make full replies to any enquiries raised by
any relevant Tax Authority in respect of VAT returns made up to Completion.

Schedule 11

  

(Basis of preparation of the Accounts, the Half Year Accounts and Target
Completion Stock Amount)

  


 

  

The Accounts and the Half Year Accounts

  


 

  

The Accounts and the Half Year Accounts were extracted from the Hyperion
system (Sara Lee\'s financial consolidation system which consolidates each
relevant country\'s general ledger systems). This system was also the basis
for Sara Lee\'s audited financial statements for the financial periods ended 3
July 2010, 27 June 2009 and 28 June 2008. Within the Hyperion consolidation
reporting system Net Sales and Contribution Margin for the Sanex Perimeter are
identified separately. Distribution expenses included in calculating
Contribution Margin have been allocated to the Sanex Perimeter in each
relevant country\'s general ledger systems. This allocation has been done
based on different key drivers such as volume, weight or sales.

  


 

  

Target Completion Stock Amount

  


 

  

The Target Completion Stock Amount has been calculated as the gross inventory
value for the 4 quarters ending 31 December 2010 extracted from each relevant
country\'s general ledger systems less a SLOBS (slow moving and obsoletes)
provision. The gross inventory value and the SLOBS provision are analyses
performed by each country based on the Sara Lee Accounting Principles. Target
Completion Stock Amount, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any
mark-ups to standard cost. Where relevant, the exchange rate used for
conversion into Euros is the Sara Lee peg rate for the 2011 financial year.

implement such alternative structure as reasonably deemed necessary by the
Unilever Parents in order to facilitate the sale and purchase of the Companies
(including but not limited to other steps or alternative structures that are
deemed necessary or desirable by the Unilever Parents). The Purchaser shall
not withhold its consent where it is not, and would not reasonably be expected
to be, adversely affected by the change. Where the Purchaser has granted such
consent, it shall (at the Unilever Parents\' cost) if so required or
contemplated hereby reasonably cooperate with the Unilever Parents to
implement such waiver, other steps or alternative structure.
