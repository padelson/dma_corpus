PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION, dated as of March 21, 2005 (this
"AGREEMENT"), by and among IAC/InterActiveCorp, a Delaware corporation
("PARENT"), AJI Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
Subsidiary (as defined herein) of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and Ask
Jeeves, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY") (collectively, the
"PARTIES").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of the
Parties have approved and declared advisable this Agreement, pursuant to
which Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the "MERGER"), with
the Company being the surviving corporation in the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions, and with the effects, set forth in this
Agreement;   WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the Merger shall constitute
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and that this Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code; and   WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and
other transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby.   NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties, intending
to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:    ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER   Section 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined
herein), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance
with Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").
Following the Effective Time, the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"), shall be a direct,
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall succeed to all of the rights and
obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Merger shall have the
effects and consequences specified in Section 259 of the DGCL.   Section
1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the third Business Day (as defined herein) immediately
following the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII hereof is satisfied or waived (other than conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other time and date
and place as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (the "CLOSING
DATE"). The term "EFFECTIVE TIME" shall mean the time and date of the filing
of a properly executed certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
DGCL, or     at such later time as agreed to by the Parties and set forth
in the Certificate of Merger. The term "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day,
other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which the commercial banks in the
state of New York are authorized or required by law to remain closed.  
Section 1.3 TAX CONSEQUENCES. It is intended that the Merger constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the
Parties agree to treat the Merger consistently with this intention for all
purposes.   ARTICLE II   DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CHARTER DOCUMENTS  
Section 2.1 DIRECTORS. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation, which
individuals shall serve as directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or their otherwise ceasing to
be directors or until their respective successors are duly appointed or
elected in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable law.  
Section 2.2 OFFICERS. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time and shall serve until their resignation or removal or
their otherwise ceasing to be officers or until their respective successors
are duly appointed or elected in accordance with the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
applicable law.   Section 2.3 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF THE
SURVIVING CORPORATION. At the Effective Time, (i) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to
read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect
immediately before the Effective Time and as set forth on Exhibit A, except
that the name shall be changed to Ask Jeeves, Inc., until altered, amended or
repealed as provided therein and under the DGCL, and (ii) the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the same as the
Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately before the Effective Time until
altered, amended or repealed as provided under the DGCL or in the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   ARTICLE III   TREATMENT OF SECURITIES   Section 3.1
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any capital
stock of the Company or Merger Sub:   (a) CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN COMPANY
SECURITIES. Each share, if any, of Company Common Stock (as defined herein)
that is held in the treasury of the Company and all shares of Company Common
Stock, if any, that are owned by Parent and any of its wholly   
-2-   owned subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of Parent or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (b) CONVERSION OF
COMPANY SECURITIES. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder thereof:   (i) Other than shares cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.1(a), each share  of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company  (together with the related right (a "RIGHT") to purchase Series
A  Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of  the
Company (the "COMPANY SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED  STOCK") issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement (the "RIGHTS  AGREEMENT") entered into
between the Company and Fleet National  Bank, N.A., dated as of April 26,
2001, the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK")  issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall  cease to be outstanding and shall be retired and
cease to exist and  shall be converted automatically, subject to Sections
3.1(d) and  3.2(d), into the right to receive 1.2668 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") 
fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par value  per
share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK") (such shares of Parent  Common Stock
together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of  Parent Common Stock
to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2(d),  collectively are referred to as the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION").   (ii) At the Effective Time, each Certificate (as
defined herein)  theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock, as
the case  may be, shall, without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent  or the holder thereof, represent, and shall be deemed to represent 
from and after the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent  Common
Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional securities) as  determined in
accordance with Section 3.1(b)(i) above and shall  cease to represent any
rights in any shares of capital stock of the  Company or the Surviving
Corporation.   (c) CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB STOCK. Each share of common
stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (d) CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. The Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to fully reflect the effect of
any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (whether
such securities are stock of Parent or a subsidiary, including as a result of
any spin-off), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change, with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or for
which a record date is established) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time.   Section 3.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.  
(a) DEPOSIT WITH EXCHANGE AGENT. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company selected
by Parent    -3-    that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT"), pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company, certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable at the Effective Time in the Merger pursuant to
Section 3.1(b).   (b) EXCHANGE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (each, a
"CERTIFICATE" and collectively, the "CERTIFICATES") that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b): (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.
Upon surrender of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a book-entry account
statement reflecting ownership of (or, if requested, a stock
certificate representing) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
into which the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates are converted in accordance with Section 3.1(b), and (ii) cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(d). In the event that the Merger
Consideration is to be delivered to any person who is not the person in whose
name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be delivered to
a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate (other than a Certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 3.1(a)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration contemplated by Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The Merger Consideration
will be delivered to each former stockholder of the Company by the Exchange
Agent as promptly as practicable following surrender of a Certificate and a
duly executed letter of transmittal. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to provisions of this
Article III.   (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 3.2(d) until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect, if any,
of unclaimed property, escheat and other applicable laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of
the    -4-   certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
applicable payment date, any dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to the date
of such surrender.   (d) NO FRACTIONAL SECURITIES. In lieu of any fractional
securities, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon
surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Article III will be
paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder\'s respective
proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open
market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Article III.
As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
determine the excess of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon surrender of Certificates by the holders of Company Common
Stock (without excluding fractional shares), delivered to the Exchange Agent
by Parent in accordance with Section 3.2(a), over (ii) the aggregate number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of
Company Common Stock (excluding fractional shares)(such excess being
collectively called the "EXCESS PARENT COMMON STOCK"). The Exchange Agent, as
agent and trustee for the former holders of Company Common Stock, shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable sell the Excess Parent Common Stock at the
prevailing prices on NASDAQ (or on the principal exchange on which the Parent
Common Stock is then traded or quoted). The sales of the Excess Parent Common
Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on NASDAQ (or such other
exchange) through one or more member firms of NASDAQ (or such other exchange)
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Parent shall
pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange
Agent and costs associated with calculating and distributing the respective
cash amounts payable to the applicable former Company stockholders, incurred
in connection with such sales of Excess Parent Common Stock. Until the net
proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the former holders of Company
Common Stock to whom fractional shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise would
have been issued, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for
such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash to be paid to former holders of Company Common Stock in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall
distribute such amounts to such former holders.   (e) CLOSING OF TRANSFER
BOOKS. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates
(or a book-entry position) representing the appropriate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 3.1 and this Section 3.2 and any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.    -5-    (f) TERMINATION OF
EXCHANGE AGENT. Any certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a) and not exchanged within
six months after the Effective Time pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be
returned by the Exchange Agent to Parent, which shall thereafter act as
Exchange Agent. All funds or securities held by the Exchange Agent for
payment to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end
of one year from the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which
time any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a
general creditor only to Parent for payment of such funds or securities to
which such holder is entitled, subject to applicable law.   (g) ESCHEAT. To
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, neither Parent nor the
Company shall be liable to any person for any funds or securities delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.   (h) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting
by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   (i)
WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates
which, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   (j) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP
RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
paid upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of Articles I, II and III (including any cash paid pursuant to
Section 3.2(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock.   Section 3.3 COMPANY OPTIONS, OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS AND
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. (a) Each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (a "COMPANY OPTION") granted under the employee and director
stock plans of the Company, but excluding the ESPP (the "STOCK PLANS"),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the
Effective Time, into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a
"PARENT OPTION"), on the same terms and    -6-   conditions (including
vesting) as were applicable under such Company Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such Parent Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, down
to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Option
shall have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal
to the per share exercise price of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio.   (b) The Company shall
take any actions with respect to the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP") as are necessary to (i) provide that the ESPP shall terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time and all balances in ESPP participant
accounts shall be applied to the purchase of shares in accordance with the
terms of the ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) limit the
total number of shares purchased between the date hereof and the Effective
Time to 260,000 in the aggregate.   (c) At the Effective Time all other
equity based awards of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into equity based awards of Parent and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such awards shall be equal
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such equity-
based award of the Company immediately prior to the effective time multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, down to the nearest whole share
of Parent Common Stock.   (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all necessary action for the adjustment of the Company Options under
this Section 3.3 and the adjustment of other equity based awards of the
Company under this Section 3.3, and will take all necessary action to ensure
that no holders of Company Options or other equity-based awards of the
Company will be able to receive shares of Company Common Stock after the
Effective Time. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, that will be subject to Parent Options as a result of the actions
contemplated by this Section 3.3. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (and in any event not later than two Business Days following
the Effective Time), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Parent Options and shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Parent Options remain outstanding and are required to
be registered.   Section 3.4 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. The Company shall give all
such notices as may be required by the terms of the Zero Coupon
Convertible Subordinated Notes, due June 1, 2008 (the "CONVERTIBLE NOTES") in
respect of the matters contemplated by this Article III, at the times and in
the manner required by such Convertible Notes.    -7-    ARTICLE IV  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as disclosed in the

Delaware. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to

aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this
Agreement, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means, with respect to Parent
or the Company, as the case may be, any condition, state of facts, change or
effect that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to

contemplated hereby PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Material Adverse Effect shall not
be deemed to include the impact of any condition, fact, change or effect
relating to or arising from (A) the execution, announcement, or consummation

impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with partners
(including, without limitation, joint venture partners, syndication partners

limitation, Sections 144 and 203 of the DGCL, respectively, is or becomes
operative with Parent, its affiliates or transferees, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby). Except for the filing of the Certificate

in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights
of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies).   (b)
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Company Charter or
the Bylaws of the Company, or violate or conflict with any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which any shares of capital stock of the Company,
or securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of capital stock of
the Company, have been issued, or (ii) subject to the making of the filings
and obtaining the approvals referred to in Section 4.5 and the effectiveness
of such filings and/or receipt of the consents and approvals in connection
therewith, (A) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,

trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in
the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
losses of benefits, defaults, terminations, cancellations,   
-11-   accelerations, Liens or payments which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
Section 4.4 AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT. (a) The Board of Directors of the
Company has taken all necessary action to amend the Rights Agreement so that,
for so long as this Agreement is in full force and effect: (i) the execution
or delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not cause (A) the Rights to become exercisable under
the Rights Agreement, (B) Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates to
be deemed an Acquiring Person (as that term is used in the Rights Agreement),
or (C) the Distribution Date or the Share Acquisition Date (as these terms
are used in the Rights Agreement) to occur; and (ii) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Rights shall expire and no longer be outstanding.   (b)

Governmental Entity or third party are necessary in connection with (A) the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and (B) the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby. As of
the date hereof, to the Company\'s Knowledge, there is no reason why the
receipt of any such consents or approvals will not be obtained in a customary
time frame once complete and appropriate filings have been made by the
Company and Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, the "KNOWLEDGE" of any
person that is not an individual means, with respect to any matter
in question, the actual knowledge of such person\'s executive officers and
other officers having primary responsibility for such matter, in each case
based upon reasonable inquiry consistent with such person\'s title and
responsibilities.   Section 4.6 SEC REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The

to modify information as of an earlier date.   (b) The Company has

accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable) and any other applicable
legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

for the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit Plan; (xi) each
individual who renders services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who

status of an independent contractor or other non-employee status for any
purpose (including for purposes of taxation and tax reporting and under
Company Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized, except to the extent
that, in the aggregate, any such misclassifications would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability for the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any Company Benefit Plan and (xii) there does not now
exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to

vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any

of the Company\'s Board of Directors has taken any action to accelerate the
vesting of any stock options or other equity-based compensation awards in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.13
SECURITIES LAW MATTERS.   (a) With respect to each Annual Report on Form
10-K and each Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q included in the Company Reports,
the financial statements and other financial information included in such
reports fairly present in all material respects the financial   
-18-   condition as of the dates thereof and the results of operations for
the periods then ended of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries.  
(b) There are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in either
the design or operation of internal controls of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the ability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to record, process, summarize and
report financial information. With respect to periods after January 1, 2002,
the Company has no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud involving
(x) management of the Company (including its consolidated Subsidiaries) who
have a significant role in the internal controls related to financial
reporting, (y) any employees of the Company (including its consolidated
Subsidiaries) where such fraud could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company or (z) any officer or
employee of the Company whose role, actions or activities would be required
to be considered in certifying internal controls of the Company pursuant to
Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.   (c) The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
Company\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by
others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared; and such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Company\'s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
material information required to be included in the Company\'s periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.   Section 4.14 COMPLIANCE WITH
APPLICABLE LAW, PERMITS AND LICENSES. (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in conflict with, is in default or violation of, or has since
December 31, 2001 been investigated for, or charged by any Governmental
Entity with, a violation of any material law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has, directly or indirectly, paid or delivered any
fee, commission or other sum of money or item of property,
however characterized, to any government official or other governmental
party, in the United States or any other country, which is in any manner
related to the business or operations of such entities and which is or was
illegal under any applicable law (including, without limitation, the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder).   (b) The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
employees hold all material permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders,
registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities that are required
for the operation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"COMPANY PERMITS"). Section 4.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a list of the Company Permits. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and for the past five years has been, in compliance in all
material respects with the terms of the Company Permits, all of the Company
Permits are in full force and effect and no suspension, modification or
revocation of any of them is pending or, to the knowledge of the   
-19-   Company, threatened, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, do
reasonable grounds exist for any such action.   Section 4.15 INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY; PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, EMPLOYEE RESTRICTIONS; ASSETS. (a) To the
Knowledge of the Company, all U.S. and foreign (i) copyrights, (ii)
trademarks, service marks, trade dress and logos, (iii) trade names, (iv)
Internet domain names, (v) patents and patent applications, and (vi) trade
secrets rights, including any of the foregoing rights in any inventions, know
how, practices, methods, processes, designs, or other information used by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to compete with third parties, computer hardware
and software, including programming processes, source code, object code,
algorithms, structure, display screens, user interfaces, layouts, development
tools, instructions, and templates, technology, processes and formulae, and
including all registrations and applications for the foregoing intellectual
property rights (collectively, "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY") used by the Company
or its Subsidiaries in their respective businesses (collectively, "COMPANY
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY") are owned by the Company or such Subsidiaries by
operation of law, or have been assigned to the Company or such
Subsidiaries ("COMPANY OWNED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"), or the Company and such
Subsidiaries otherwise have the right to use such Company Intellectual
Property in their businesses as currently conducted, such as by license
("COMPANY LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"). To the Knowledge of the Company,
the Company Intellectual Property is sufficient to carry on the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted. Except as set forth
in Section 4.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the Company or its Subsidiaries have exclusive ownership of all
Company Owned Intellectual Property used by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or are entitled to use all Company Licensed Intellectual Property in the
Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' businesses as presently conducted, subject,
in the case of Company Licensed Intellectual Property, to the terms of the
license agreements or other agreements covering such Company Licensed
Intellectual Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, having made reasonable inquiry of appropriate Company
personnel, the other parties thereto are not in material breach of any of the
license agreements or other agreements covering the Company Licensed
Intellectual Property, except for any breaches that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the present business activities or products of the
Company and its Subsidiaries do not infringe in any material respect any
Intellectual Property of others ("THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL Property"). To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not, within
the past two (2) years, received any notice or other claim from any third
party asserting that any of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' activities
infringe or may infringe any Third Party Intellectual Property of such third
party, nor do any active material infringement claims made prior to such
period remain unresolved, or the Company or its Subsidiaries have
not received any further communications from such third parties regarding
any infringement claim prior to such two year period.   (b) Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, (i) to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have the right to use all Intellectual Property and other
information material to their businesses as presently conducted, (ii)
the Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures in accordance
with customary industry practices to protect and preserve the security
and confidentiality of their trade secrets and other confidential
information, (iii) to the    -20-   Knowledge of the Company, all trade
secrets and other confidential information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are material to their businesses are not part of the public
domain or knowledge, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, have they been
misappropriated by any person having an obligation to not use such trade
secrets or to maintain such trade secrets or other confidential information
in confidence for the Company or its Subsidiaries or disclosed by such a
person in violation of such obligations, and (iv) to the Knowledge of the
Company, no employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has made unauthorized use of any trade secrets or other confidential
information of any other person or entity in the course of the employee\'s or
consultant\'s work for the Company or such Subsidiary. Schedule 4.15(b) sets
forth all material patents, patent applications, domain name registrations,
registered copyrights, applications for registration of copyright, registered
trademarks, and applications for registration of trademarks that are part of
the Company Owned Intellectual Property; provided that Company Intellectual
Property shall not be deemed to be Company Owned Intellectual Property unless
it is owned outright by the Company. By way of example and not limitation,
ownership or possession by the Company or its Subsidiary of a security
interest or exclusive license with respect to Company Intellectual Property
shall not cause such Company Intellectual Property to be deemed to be Company
Owned Intellectual Property for purposes of this Section 4.15(b).   (c) To
the Knowledge of the Company, no university or government agency (whether
federal, state or foreign) has any claim of ownership in the Company Owned
Intellectual Property, except as identified in Section 4.15(c)(1) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has no Knowledge of any
active material infringement, dilution or misappropriation by others of the
Company Owned Intellectual Property, or any material violation of the
confidentiality of any of its trade secrets or other confidential
information, except as identified in Section 4.15(c)(2) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. To the Company\'s Knowledge, the Company is not making
unlawful use of any third party confidential information or trade secrets of
any past or present employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  
(d) The Company or its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to or the
current right to possess all material real property and material
personal property owned or leased by them, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the assets, properties and rights owned or leased by or licensed to
the Company and its Subsidiaries constitute all such assets, properties and
rights as are necessary in the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as identified in Section 4.15(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (e) To the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries distributes Spyware or Adware
in connection with the businesses they conduct. "SPYWARE" means any software
that covertly gathers information regarding user online activity through the
user\'s Internet connection (I.E., without notice that such information may
be gathered), whether or not such software is bundled as a hidden component
of the Company\'s toolbar or like applications, other than information (i)
reasonably gathered in connection with services or information provided by
Company or its Subsidiaries to such users, or (ii) that is not associated
with personally identifiable information. "ADWARE" means any software that
causes advertising to pop-up as a new window (over or under) on the user\'s
computer based on the user\'s online activity (other than advertisements that
Company serves to visitors to the Company\'s web site domains while those
customers are visiting or exiting such domains) or which is used to
distribute Spyware. Each of the Company\'s applications can be readily   
-21-   uninstalled by users using commercially available uninstall
utilities, and no such application, if uninstalled, can reinstall itself
without the consent of such users; provided that Company makes no
representation or warranty that such uninstall process will always operate
without error.   Section 4.16 CERTAIN CONTRACTS; LEASES. Section 4.16 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each contract, arrangement, commitment
or understanding (whether written or oral) to which it or its Subsidiaries is
a party:   (a) that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in
Item  601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date
of  this Agreement;   (b) that materially restricts the conduct of any line
of business by  the Company or upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement will restrict the conduct of any line of
business by Parent, or  Parent\'s Subsidiaries or the ability of Parent or
any of Parent\'s  Subsidiaries to engage in any line of business;   (c)
that upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement
will subject any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any 
exclusivity arrangements with or to a labor union or guild (including any 
collective bargaining agreement);   (d) (other than any plan or agreement
covered by Section 4.12 hereof)  any of the benefits of which will be
increased, or the vesting of the  benefits of which will be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any stockholder  approval or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated  on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;   (e) that is with Google, Inc. or any of
its Subsidiaries ("GOOGLE");   (f) that is a material license or contract
relating to Company  Intellectual Property; or   (g) the absence, breach,
non-performance, amendment or termination of  which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this Section 4.16 is referred to
herein as a "COMPANY CONTRACT," and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any material violation of
the above by any of the other parties thereto which would have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or with
respect to a Company Contract described in Section 4.16(b), a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent following the Merger. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent, or publicly filed with the SEC, a true and complete
copy of each Company Contract. Except for those Company Contracts marked with
an asterisk (*) as set forth in Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Company Contract requires the consent of any other contracting
party to prevent a breach of, or a default under, or a termination, change in
the terms or conditions or modification of, such Company Contract as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   -22-   
(h)(i) Each Company Contract is valid and binding on the Company or  any of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii)  the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects  performed
all material obligations required to be performed by it to date  under each
Company Contract, and (iii) no event or condition exists which  constitutes
or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a  material
default on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  under any such
Company Contract.   (i) Section 4.16(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a  complete and accurate list and description of all real property
leased,  subleased or otherwise occupied by the Company or its Subsidiaries
(the  "LEASED REAL PROPERTY"). The Company and its Subsidiaries do not own
any  real property. All of the leases or subleases of the Leased Real
Property  (the "LEASES") are valid, binding and in full force and effect. No
Lease is  subject to any mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, sublease,
assignment,  license or other agreement granting to any third party any
interest in such  Lease or any right to the use or occupancy of any Leased
Real Property. The  Company, a Subsidiary or valid sublessee, as lessee under
each Lease, is  now in possession of all of the applicable Leased Real
Property. To the  Knowledge of the Company, there is no pending or threatened
proceeding that  might interfere in any material respect with the quiet
enjoyment of each  lessee. To the Company\'s Knowledge, the Company or a
Subsidiary has  performed all material obligations required to be performed
by it to date  under each Lease, and no event or condition exists which
constitutes or,  after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
material default  on the part of the Company or such Subsidiary under any
such Lease. The  Company or a Subsidiary has exercised within the time
prescribed in each  Lease any option provided therein to extend or renew the
term thereof. As  used herein, the term "Lease" shall also include subleases,
the term  "lessor" shall also include any sublessor, and the term "lessee"
shall also  include any sublessee.   Section 4.17 UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.
Except for those liabilities that are disclosed in the footnotes to or
reserved against on the Company Financial Statements (and only to the extent
of such disclosure or reserve) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice which have not had or would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, since December 31, 2004, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, determined, determinable, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due).   Section 4.18 INSURANCE. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have in effect insurance coverage with reputable insurers or are
self-insured, which, in respect of amounts, premiums, types and risks
insured, constitutes reasonably adequate coverage against all risks
customarily insured against by companies and their subsidiaries in the same
or similar lines of business as the Company and its Subsidiaries and
comparable in size and operations to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company has made available to Parent a copy of all material insurance
policies and all material self insurance programs and arrangements relating
to the business, assets and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "INSURANCE POLICIES"). Each of such Insurance Policies is in full force
and effect as of the date of this Agreement. From December 31, 2002 through
the date hereof, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received
any notice or other communication regarding any actual or possible
(a) cancellation of    -23-   any Insurance Policy that has not been
renewed in the ordinary course without any lapse in coverage, (b)
invalidation of any Insurance Policy, (c) refusal of any coverage or
rejection of any material claim under any Insurance Policy, or (d) material
adjustment in the amount of the premiums payable with respect to any
Insurance Policy.   Section 4.19 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. Except for matters
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, there are no legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of
action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or
governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that
reasonably could result in the imposition, on the Company of any liability or
obligation arising under common law or under any local, state or federal
environmental statute, regulation or ordinance relating to human health or
the environment, including, without limitation, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened against the
Company, which liability or obligation would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for
any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would
impose any liability or obligation that would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, and the Company is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment,
decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority,
regulatory agency or third party imposing any such liability or
obligation.   Section 4.20 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. No "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover statute
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) is applicable to the Merger or to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 4.21
REGISTRATION STATEMENT. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
the Company in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement (as defined herein) will, at the time
such Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to
any information provided by Parent, Merger Sub and/or by their auditors,
legal counsel, financial advisors or other consultants or
advisors specifically for use in the Registration Statement.   Section 4.22
TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. Except as set forth in the Company Reports or
compensation or other employment arrangements in the ordinary course, there
are no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any affiliate
(including any officer or director) thereof, but not including any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand ("COMPANY AFFILIATE
TRANSACTIONS").   Section 4.23 OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS. The
Company\'s Board of Directors has received the opinions, dated as of the date
hereof, of Allen and Company and Citigroup Global Markets to the effect that
the Exchange Ratio in the Merger is fair to holders of   
-24-   Company Common Stock from a financial point of view as of such date.
Such opinion has not been withdrawn or modified in any material respect.  
Section 4.24 RELATIONSHIP WITH GOOGLE. Since December 31, 2004 there has not
been any adverse change in the business relationship of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with Google. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
have received, prior to the date hereof, notice of (i) Google\'s intention to
breach, terminate, or alter any contract between Google and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) early termination of, or a request for a

or (iii) Google\'s belief that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are not

"traffic metrics," and the data contained therein fairly presents the
specified internet traffic of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
periods indicated therein.   ARTICLE V   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
PARENT AND MERGER SUB   Except as disclosed in the corresponding number and
subsection of the Parent disclosure schedule delivered to the Company
concurrently herewith (the "PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), or in such other
number and subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule where the
applicability of such exception is reasonably apparent, as an inducement to
the Company entering into this Agreement and completing the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to
the Company as follows:   Section 5.1 CORPORATE ORGANIZATION. Each of
Parent, the Merger Sub and the Subsidiaries of Parent is duly organized and
validly existing as an entity in good standing under the laws of the

Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Subsidiaries of Parent has the power and authority to own, lease and operate
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified and in good standing would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Subsidiaries of Parent is in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it
purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to have such franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has previously made available true
and complete copies of (i) the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent and the
Bylaws of Parent, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and any

Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to Parent\'s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared; and such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent\'s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parent\'s periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act.   Section 5.7 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. Except

for, or charged by any Governmental Entity with, a violation of any material
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent or any

Subsidiaries do not infringe in any material respect any Intellectual
Property of others, except for any infringing activity that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on

liabilities that are disclosed in the footnotes to or reserved against on the

reserve) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice which have not had or would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, since
December 31, 2004, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have incurred
any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
determined, determinable, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to

Subsidiaries is or may be subject to material income Tax in such
jurisdiction. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to
any material Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement, other than such agreements with customers, vendors, lessors or
the like entered into in the ordinary course of business. Neither Parent nor

promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or
advisable    -35-   to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities.
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of material non-public information,
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, provided, that Parent or the Company may restrict access to
such documents that discuss the pricing or valuation of the other Party or
its businesses. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall
act reasonably, in good faith and as promptly as reasonably practicable. The
Parties agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of
the transactions contemplated herein.   (c) Parent and the Company shall,
upon request, furnish the other Parties with all information concerning
themselves, their Subsidiaries and their Subsidiaries\' affiliates,
directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing in compliance with
applicable legal requirements of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Registration Statement or any other legally required statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent or the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) The
Company and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
advise the other Parties upon receiving any communication from
any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined herein) will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed. Subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of material non-public information,
such Party shall provide a copy of such communication to the other Party
promptly upon request.   (e) The separation of Parent into two separate
companies which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2005 (the
"PARENT SPIN-OFF") will not be effected in a manner that will jeopardize the
status of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. Parent shall not take any action that, for federal income tax
purposes, will cause the Parent Spin-Off to result in the recognition of
material gain or loss by any Company stockholder as a result of any
distribution with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock acquired by such
Company shareholder in the Merger. Parent shall not effect or consummate the
Parent Spin-Off until after the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall have been consummated.   Section 7.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a) Upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
material non-public information, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees,    -36-   accountants, counsel and other representatives of
the other Parties, access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records, in order to reasonably verify the representations
and warranties of the other Party herein and to the extent otherwise
reasonably required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
During such period, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other Parties: (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement, SEC comment letter and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws (other than reports or documents
which such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such other Parties may reasonably request. No Party shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate the rights of its customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client or work product or other legally recognized privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
written agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Parties will in good faith consider and seek to implement reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.   (b) Each of the Parties
shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of any other Party or
any of such Party\'s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section
7.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement between Parent and the
Company, dated as of January 10, 2005 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"). The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby shall not be deemed a breach or violation of the Confidentiality
Agreement.   (c) No investigation by any of the Parties or their
respective representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of
the other set forth herein.   Section 7.3 ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS. (a)
After the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees
that neither it, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of the officers and
directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\'
employees, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors or
other agents acting on the Company\'s behalf, not to initiate, solicit,
negotiate, encourage or provide non-public or confidential information or in
any way facilitate any proposal or offer to acquire more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the business, properties or assets of the Company, or
fifteen percent (15%) of the capital stock or voting power of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, in each case, whether by merger, purchase of assets,
tender offer or otherwise, whether for cash, securities or any other
consideration or combination thereof (any such transactions being referred to
herein as an "ACQUISITION TRANSACTION").   (b) Notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph (a) above but subject to compliance with Section
7.3(c), (i) the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company may,
directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries,
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval, in response to a bona
fide written offer or proposal not    -37-   solicited in violation of
Section 7.3(a) with respect to a potential or proposed Acquisition
Transaction ("ACQUISITION PROPOSAL") from a corporation, partnership, person
or other entity or group (a "POTENTIAL ACQUIRER") (a) which the Company\'s
Board of Directors determines, in good faith and after consultation with an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, would
reasonably be expected to result (if consummated pursuant to its terms) in an
Acquisition Transaction more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than
the Merger (a "QUALIFYING PROPOSAL"), (b) which the Company\'s Board of
Directors determines, in good faith, is reasonably possible to consummate,
and (c) where the Company\'s Board of Directors after consultation with its
independent outside legal counsel determines in good faith that the failure
to engage in such action reasonably would be likely to cause the members of
the Board of Directors of the Company to breach their fiduciary duties
under applicable law, furnish confidential or non-public information to
(provided that the Company and the Potential Acquirer shall have fully
executed and delivered a confidentiality agreement containing terms at least
as stringent as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, but explicitly
permitting the Company to disclose to Parent the terms of the Acquisition
Proposal), and negotiate with, such Potential Acquirer, and may resolve to
accept, or recommend, and, upon termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.1(e) and after payment to Parent of the fee pursuant to
Section 9.2(b), enter into agreements relating to, a Qualifying Proposal as
to which the Company\'s Board of Directors (x) has determined in good faith
after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation would result in an Acquisition Transaction more
favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than the Merger and is reasonably
capable of being financed and consummated (such Qualifying Proposal being a
"SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") and (y) after consultation with its independent outside
legal counsel determines in good faith that failure to engage in such action
would cause the members of the Board of Directors of the Company to breach
their fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) the Company\'s Board of
Directors may take and disclose to the Company\'s stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or otherwise
make disclosure required by the federal securities laws. It is understood and
agreed that negotiations and other activities conducted in accordance with
this paragraph (b) shall not constitute a violation of paragraph (a) of this
Section 7.3.   (c) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing
promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days, after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, indication of interest or request for non-public
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any Subsidiary by any person or entity that after the date hereof
informs the Board of Directors of the Company or such Subsidiary that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to
Parent shall indicate the identity of the offeror.   (d) The Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties
other than the Parties with respect to any of the foregoing; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall waive any
standstill or confidentiality provisions.   (e) The Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to any corporation, partnership, person or other   
-38-   entity or group making an Acquisition Proposal, unless such
information has been previously provided to Parent.   Section 7.4
STOCKHOLDERS\' APPROVAL. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause a
special meeting of stockholders of the Company (the "STOCKHOLDER MEETING") to
be held as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is available to be
mailed to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the requisite
stockholder approval of this Agreement (the "STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL"). The
Company\'s Board of Directors shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain from
the stockholders of the Company the vote required by the DGCL in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and shall recommend to the stockholders of the
Company that they so vote at the Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof; PROVIDED that the Company\'s Board of Directors
shall not be required to use such reasonable efforts to obtain the vote in
favor of the approval of this Agreement or to make or continue to make
such recommendation if such Board of Directors, after having consulted with
and considered the advice of independent outside legal counsel, determines
that the making of such reasonable best efforts to obtain the vote in favor
of the approval of this Agreement or making or continuing to make such
recommendation would cause the members of the Company\'s Board of Directors
to breach their fiduciary duties under applicable laws. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this Agreement is earlier
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall be required to
submit the Stockholder Proposal for approval by its stockholders at the
Stockholder Meeting, whether with or without the recommendation of the
Company\'s Board of Directors.   Section 7.5 LEGAL CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER.
Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article
VIII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b)
to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained

connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including Section 7.1(b)), (i) the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, agree to divest any assets or businesses of
the Company or any of its affiliates or to in any way limit the ownership
or operation of any business of the Company or its affiliates and (ii)
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to (x) divest or encumber
any assets or corporations of Parent or the Company, respectively, or any of
their respective affiliates that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent (assuming the Merger has been consummated)
or to substantially impair the benefits to Parent and the Company expected,
as of the date hereof, to be realized from consummation of the Merger, and
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to agree to or effect any
divestiture, hold separate any business or take any other action that is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger, or (y) enter into any agreements
that in any way limit the ownership or operation of any business of Parent or
the Company, respectively, or any of their respective affiliates.  
-39-    Section 7.6 AFFILIATES. The Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause each person, listed on EXHIBIT B hereto to deliver to
Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form of

or otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by
such "affiliate" in the Merger, other than in compliance with Rule 145 under
the Securities Act. Other than those persons listed on EXHIBIT B, there are
no "affiliates" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the
Company.   Section 7.7 STOCK EXCHANGE QUOTATION OR LISTING. Parent shall
use reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger and upon exercise of Parent Options into which Company

quotation on NASDAQ or such other national exchange on which the Parent
Common Stock may then be quoted or listed (subject only to official notice of
issuance) prior to the Effective Time.   Section 7.8 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.

or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise establish in the Surviving Corporation full

rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, (a)
the proper officers and directors of each Party and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, and (b) the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation to take all such lawful and reasonably necessary or desirable
action.   Section 7.9 ADVICE OF CHANGES. Parent and the Company shall
each promptly advise the other Party of any change or event having a Material
Adverse Effect on it, and Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise
the other of any change or event that it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein such that the
conditions contained in Sections 8.3(a) or 8.3(b) shall no longer be capable
of satisfaction.   Section 7.10 SECTION 16. Prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be prudent or
required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to the Company Common Stock) and acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such Parent
Securities) by each person who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.   Section 7.11 DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\'
INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the
current policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are not materially    -40-   less advantageous)
with respect to matters or events occurring prior to the Effective Time to
the extent available; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation or its affiliates be required to expend more than an amount per
year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the Company (which
amounts under current policies are set forth in Section 7.11 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) (the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM")to maintain or procure insurance
coverage pursuant hereto; and, provided, further that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain or to cause to be obtained
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Premium and provided, further, that if such insurance policies cannot
be obtained at all, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be required
to purchase all available extended reporting periods with respect to pre-
existing insurance in an amount that, together with all other policies
purchased pursuant to this Section 7.11(a), does not exceed the amount equal
to the Maximum Premium multiplied by six.   (b) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company, determined as of the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters relating to their duties or actions in their capacity
as such (or in such capacity in another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise at the request of the Company) and
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including those
matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted to be so indemnified by the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, under applicable law (including, without
limitation, the advancement of reasonable attorney\'s fees and disbursements,
which shall be paid, reimbursed or advanced by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation prior to the final disposition thereof without the requirement of
any bond or other security). Parent agrees that all rights to
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation existing in favor of the
present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as provided in the Company\'s or any such Subsidiary\'s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or existing indemnification agreements, as in
effect as of the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring through the
Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect, without any amendment that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the individuals who on or at any time prior to the Effective
Time were entitled to rights thereunder.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that
is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
officers, directors or employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7.11 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.   (d) If Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or    -41-   substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.11.   (e) The rights of
each Indemnified Party under this Section 7.11 shall be in addition to any
rights such person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware law or any other
applicable laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party.   Section 7.12 REORGANIZATION. Following the Effective
Time, neither the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor any of their
affiliates shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take
any commercially reasonable action or cause any commercially reasonable
action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act would or could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(i) under any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) to the extent that any such
crediting of service would result in duplication of benefits, (iii) for
purposes of eligibility for subsidized early retirement benefits or (iv) for
any new program for which credit prior to the effective date of such program
is not given to similarly situated employees of Parent other than the
Transferring Employees.   (c) The health plans that cover the Transferring

party has fulfilled its obligations under Section 7.1;   (c) by Parent or
the Company if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before the
six-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "TERMINATION DATE"),
unless the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date shall be
principally due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such Party
set forth herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if on such date each of
the conditions set forth in Article VIII other than those set forth in
Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(c) has been fulfilled or is capable of being
fulfilled, then such date shall be automatically extended to the nine-month
anniversary of the date of this Agreement;   -46-    (d) (i) by the
Company (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein which
breach either individually or in the aggregate would constitute, if occurring
on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections
8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) of this Agreement) if there shall have been a breach
by Parent of any of its covenants or agreements or any of its representations
or warranties set forth in this Agreement, which breach, either individually
or in the aggregate, would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or

by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements or any of
its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, which breach,
in any such case, either individually or in the aggregate, would constitute,
if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) of this Agreement, and which is
not cured as promptly as practicable and in any case within fifteen (15)
days following written notice to the Company or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date;   (e) by the Company if, prior
to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company receives a
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company shall have promptly (and in no event
later than two calendar days, which shall include at least one Business Day,
after forming such intention) notified Parent of its intention to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e), such notice to Parent to be
in writing and to be accompanied by reasonable details of the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the offeror,
a complete copy of each agreement contemplated to be entered into by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Superior Proposal, and the
Company shall have otherwise complied with Section 7.3, (iii) if requested in
good faith by Parent within two Business Days after receipt by Parent of
such notice, the Company shall have negotiated and caused its respective
financial and legal advisers to negotiate during the following three Business
Day period with Parent to in good faith determine with Parent whether
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted
terms, and notwithstanding such negotiations and adjustments, the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes, in its good faith judgment, that the
transactions contemplated herein on such terms as adjusted, are not at least
as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal and
(iv) the Board of Directors of the Company thereafter resolves to accept such
Superior Proposal after having consulted with, its independent outside legal
counsel and determined in good faith that the failure to take such action
would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of the Company under applicable law; PROVIDED, that such termination under
this Section 9.1(e) shall not be effective until the Company or an Acquiring
Person on behalf of the Company has made payment of the full fee required by
Section 9.2(b); and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Company\'s Board of
Directors concludes that Parent\'s proposal under clause (iii) is at least as
favorable to    -47-   the stockholders of the Company as the Superior
Proposal, this Agreement shall promptly be amended to reflect such terms and
the Company shall no longer have the right herein with respect to such
original Superior Proposal, unless and until it is subsequently adjusted to
again constitute a Superior Proposal;   (f) by Parent, if the Board of
Directors of the Company (i) shall have failed to recommend, or shall have
withdrawn, or modified or amended in any respect materially adverse to
Parent, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or shall have
resolved to do any of the foregoing, or (ii) shall have recommended another
Acquisition Proposal or if the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
resolved to accept a Superior Proposal or shall have failed to publicly
affirm its approval or recommendation of this Agreement (or failed to
publicly state that it cannot at such time make any recommendation
pending completion of its analysis and discussions regarding the Acquisition
Proposal consistent with the Company Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties)
within 10 days of Parent\'s request made after any Acquisition Proposal shall
have been disclosed to the Company\'s stockholders generally; or   (g) by
Parent or the Company if the stockholders of the Company fail to approve this

the payment required by Section 9.2(b)(iv), if applicable.   Section 9.2

without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles.   (b) Each
