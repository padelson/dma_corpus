 record such Liens and evidence the release or discharge of such financing

instructions in the Payoff Letter, and the amount that otherwise would be paid
to S2 pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(iii)_ shall be correspondingly
reduced by the Payoff Amount.

 

Section 3.3 _Estimated True-Up Liability_.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, S2 will prepare
and deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimate of the True-Up Liability
determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied by S2 in accordance
with past practice of the Business, together with a calculation of
the aggregate thereof (such aggregate amount, the " _Estimated True-Up
Liability_"). Purchaser shall have the right to receive and review such
supporting documentation or data as Purchaser may reasonably request relating
thereto and to discuss them with S2; _provided_ that the acceptance by
Purchaser of the Estimated True-Up Liability at the Closing, or the
consummation of the Closing, shall not limit or otherwise affect Purchasers
rights under this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, or
constitute an acknowledgment or agreement by Purchaser of the accuracy
thereof. For the sake of clarity, Purchasers acceptance of S2s calculation
of the Estimated True-Up Liability is not a condition to Closing.

 

(b) Within one-hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, at Purchasers cost and expense, prepare and deliver
to S2 a written calculation of Purchasers good faith calculation of the
actual amount of the True-Up Liability (the " _Calculation_ "), determined in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied by S2 in accordance with past
practice of the Business, together with a calculation of the aggregate thereof
(the " _Actual  True-Up Liability_").

(c) S2 shall have the right to receive and review such supporting
documentation or data as S2 may reasonably request relating to the Calculation
and to discuss them with Purchaser. S2 shall, within thirty (30) days after
delivery by Purchaser of the Calculation, complete its review of the
Calculation. If S2 has any objections of or dispute with the Calculation, then
S2 shall deliver a written notice to Purchaser on or before the last day of
such thirty (30) day period (" _Notice of Objection_ ") setting forth
a description of the basis of S2s objection and proposed adjustments to the
Calculation. If S2 delivers a Notice of Objection to Purchaser, Purchaser
shall then have thirty (30) days to review and respond to the Notice of
Objection. Purchaser shall have the right to receive and review such
supporting documentation or data as Purchaser may reasonably request relating
to the Notice of Objection and to discuss them with S2. Purchaser and S2 shall
seek in good faith to mutually resolve any differences which they may have
with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Objection. If S2 does
not deliver a Notice of Objection, S2 shall conclusively be deemed to have
accepted the Calculation and it shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties.

(d) If S2 and Purchaser are unable to mutually resolve all of
their disagreements with respect to the Notice of Objection by the date
thirty (30) days following Purchasers receipt of the Notice of Objection,
then then either S2 or Purchaser may refer their remaining differences to a
third-party public accounting firm that does not have any current
relationship any Seller, any Principal, or Malibu or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates (the " _Accountant_ "). If either party refers any
disagreement regarding 

 



19

    

 the Calculation to the Accountant, each of S2 and Purchaser shall prepare
and submit to the Accountant such remaining differences. The Accountant shall
have the right to receive and review such supporting documentation or data as
the Accountant may reasonably request from S2 and Purchaser relating to such
differences. It is the intent of the parties that no formal arbitration rules
shall be followed in connection with the Accountants activities, that the
scope of the Accountants engagement shall be limited to resolving such
differences in accordance with, and by application of, the terms (including
the applicable definitions) of this Agreement and that the Accountant
shall have no authority over any other disagreement (including questions of
law, interpretation of contract and fraud). Under no circumstances shall the
Accountant award an amount in respect of any such difference greater or lower
than the amount claimed by either S2 or Purchaser. The resolution of such
differences by the Accountant shall be final and binding, and the
determination of the Accountant shall constitute an arbitral award that is
final, binding and non-appealable, absent fraud, and upon which a judgment
may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. All fees and expenses
of the Accountant in resolving the dispute shall be allocated
between Purchaser, on the one hand, and S2, on the other hand, such that the
amount allocated to S2 bears the same proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount unsuccessfully disputed by S2 bears to the total dollar amount of the
disputed items that were submitted for resolution to the Accountant, and
Purchaser shall pay the balance. The Accountant shall also determine whether
any notices required to be given pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ have
been timely given.

 

(e) Upon the final determination of the Actual True-Up Liability (by
the failure of S2 to properly and timely deliver a Notice of Objection, by
written agreement of Purchaser and S2 and/or by determination of the
Accountant), (i) if the Actual True-Up Liability is greater than
the Estimated True-Up Liability, S2 shall promptly pay to Purchaser, the
amount by which the Actual True-Up Liability exceeds the Estimated True-Up
Liability and (ii) if the Estimated True-Up Liability is greater than the
Actual True-Up Liability, Purchaser shall promptly pay to S2, the amount of
by which the Estimated True-Up Liability exceeds the Actual True-Up Liability.

 

Section 3.4 _Representation and Warranty Insurance_. Purchaser shall
obtain on the Agreement Date, with coverage incepting on the Agreement Date
but effective at the Closing, an insurance policy in the form attached to
_Exhibit K_ (" _RWI Policy_ ") with respect to the representations and
warranties of Sellers in this Agreement and the other matters covered by such
policy and containing a waiver of subrogation by the insurer in favor of
Sellers and their directors, officers and Affiliates (except in the case of
actual fraud). The RWI Policy shall provide that Sellers and their directors,
officers and Affiliates are third party beneficiaries of the waiver of
subrogation. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement,
Purchaser agrees not to amend the RWI Policy with respect to such waiver of
subrogation without the prior written consent of Sellers. The cost of the
premium together with all taxes and application, underwriting or similar or
other fees or expenses incurred in connection with obtaining and binding the
RWI Policy (collectively, " _RWI Costs_ "), shall be paid by Purchaser.

Employment Termination Date in accordance with all applicable Laws and, prior

timely manner in connection

 



39

reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser and its Affiliates in its and their
efforts to secure employment arrangements with those Business Employees to
whom Purchaser and its Affiliates make offers of employment. Sellers shall not

solicit or similar contractual obligations, or otherwise assert with respect

would otherwise prohibit or place conditions on any such Hired Employees
acceptance of an offer of employment by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
any such Hired Employees employment by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or
any actions taken by any such Hired Employee as an employee of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates. Sellers shall provide Purchaser with such employment
information as to the Business Employees as Purchaser may reasonably request.
Sellers shall not, engage in any activity intended to discourage any
Business Employee from accepting an offer of employment from Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates.

its Affiliates (a " _Purchaser Employee Plan_ ") in which any Hired Employees
will participate effective as of the Employment Inception Date, Purchaser
will, or will cause an Affiliate to, recognize all service of Hired Employees
with Sellers as if such service were with Purchaser and its Affiliates, for
vesting and eligibility purposes in any Purchaser Employee Plan in which such
Hired Employees may be eligible to participate after the Employment Inception
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , such service will not be recognized (i) to the
extent such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) to the
extent such service was not recognized under the corresponding employee plan
of Sellers as it existed prior to the Closing Date or (iii) for any reason
under any defined benefit pension plan, retiree medical benefit plan or any
equity incentive award granted after the Closing. For one year following the
Employment Termination Date, the Purchaser Employee Plans will provide
employee benefits that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and
its Affiliates.

the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_, at the request and expense of
Purchaser, Sellers shall, with respect to any Business Owned IP included in
the Purchased Assets or with respect to any Business Confidential Information,
enforce (for the benefit of Purchaser and Sellers) any rights of, or any
obligations owed to, Sellers by or against (i) any employee or former employee
of any Seller who is not a Hired Employee or (ii) any consultant or
independent contractor of any Seller under an agreement that is not an
Assigned Contract (in each case, including ownership rights, confidentiality
obligations, invention disclosure duties, obligations to assist in preparing,
filing or prosecuting patent or other applications and obligations to
cooperate in the recordation or perfection of ownership rights, in each case,
only with respect to such Business Owned IP or Business Confidential
Information). From and after the Closing, subject to the IP License Agreements
and the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.8(c)_, at the request and expense

Employee (in each case, including ownership rights, confidentiality
obligations, invention disclosure duties, obligations to assist in preparing,
filing or prosecuting patent or other applications and obligations to
cooperate in the recordation or perfection of ownership rights, in each case,
only with respect to such Retained Business Confidential Information).

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee of
any Seller any right with respect to continuance of employment by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right
of Purchaser and its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Hired
Employees at any time, with or without cause, or restrict Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates in the exercise of its and their independent business judgment
in modifying any of the terms and conditions of the employment of the Hired
Employees following the Employment Inception Date, or restrict Purchasers or
its Affiliates ability to amend or terminate any employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement.

 



40

    

(e) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third
party beneficiary rights in any Business Employee, any beneficiary or
dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits
that may be provided to any Business Employee by Purchaser or its Affiliates
or under any benefit plan which they may maintain, or otherwise.

 

(f) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will contribute to any
Employee Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or agreement of a
Seller or any of its Affiliates. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
will assume sponsorship of, nor will they adopt as a participating company in,
any Employee Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or agreement
of a Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any part thereof.

 

Section 6.6 _Use of Names and Marks_. Promptly following the Closing, each
Seller shall (a) cease to use, distribute, display or market (or, for
clarity, use, distribute, display or market, any item, article or instrument
of any kind, including signs, invoices, labels, letterhead, business cards,

any similar name.

 

Section 6.7 _Certain Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), each Principal
and each Seller shall not, and shall not permit any controlled Affiliate
thereof to, directly or indirectly, whether or not alone or in association or
in connection with or on behalf of any Person now existing or hereafter

account or for the benefit of others (except Purchaser or its Affiliates):

 

(i) (A) engage in, participate in, own, manage, operate, control, carry on,
consult for, advise, or assist in any way, the business (collectively, "
_Restricted Business_ ") of assembling, manufacturing, producing, marketing,

components thereof (other than outboard boats that do not have any fishing-
related features (including livewells, fish-boxes, rod holders, tackle or

or marketed for a purpose of facilitating the addition (for example, in the
after-market) of any fishing-related features), anywhere in the world; (B) use

or authorize the use of the word "Pursuit" in any business; or (C) invest in
or lend to or otherwise provide financing or capital to or become an owner,

Restricted Business; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prevent any
Person from (y) holding a passive investment of up to 3% of any publicly-
listed class of securities of a Restricted Business or (z) producing
prototypes solely for testing, designing or development purposes;

 

(ii) solicit, recruit, employ or hire, directly or indirectly, any Hired
Employee or any employee of Malibu Boats, LLC or any of its controlled
Affiliates with whom a Principal or Seller has had material contact or who
otherwise became known to a Principal or Seller prior to the Agreement Date in
the course of negotiating and consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit (A) a general
solicitation to the public of general advertising

 



41

    

 or similar methods of solicitation not specifically directed at any such
Person, but in no event shall the foregoing permit the hiring or engagement of
any such Person from such solicitation or recruiting, or (B) a Principal or
Seller from soliciting or recruiting any such Person who has ceased to be
employed or retained by Purchaser and its Affiliates for at least four months;
or

 

(iii) take any action that is intended or designed, or would reasonably be
expected, to frustrate or evade the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

(b) Each Principal and each Seller represents, warrants, acknowledges and
agrees that: (i) such Person is deriving substantial value and proceeds from
the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) the restrictions (including the
duration, geographic scope, and activity restrictions) applicable to such
Person in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are necessary, fair, reasonable,
fundamental and required for the protection of the Business and the Purchased
Assets after the Closing; (iii) such restrictions relate to matters that are
of a special, unique and extraordinary value; (iv) Purchaser has required that
such Person agree to such restrictions, and such Person has voluntarily agreed
to such restrictions; and (v) Purchaser would not consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby if such Person did not enter into such
restrictions.

(c) During the Restricted Period, neither Malibu nor Purchaser shall, and
shall not permit any controlled Affiliate thereof to, directly or indirectly,
whether or not alone or in association or in connection with or on behalf of
any Person now existing or hereafter created, whether or not for its own
account or for the benefit of others, solicit, recruit, employ or hire,
directly or indirectly, any employee of any Seller or any of its controlled
Affiliates (other than the Business Employees) with whom Malibu or Purchaser
has had material contact or who otherwise became known to Malibu or Purchaser
prior to the Agreement Date in the course of negotiating and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not prohibit (A) a general solicitation to the public of general
advertising or similar methods of solicitation not specifically directed at
any such Person, but in no event shall the foregoing permit the hiring or
engagement of any such Person from such solicitation or recruiting, or (B)
Malibu or Purchaser from soliciting or recruiting any such Person who has
ceased to be employed or retained by Sellers and its Affiliates for at least
four months. Malibu and Purchaser represent, warrant, acknowledge and agree
that: (i) the restrictions (including the duration, geographic scope, and
activity restrictions) applicable to such Person in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
are necessary, fair, reasonable, fundamental and required for the protection
of the Retained Business after the Closing; (ii) such restrictions relate to
matters that are of a special, unique and extraordinary value; (iii) Sellers
have required that such Person agree to such restrictions, and such Person
has voluntarily agreed to such restrictions; and (iv) Sellers would not
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby if such Person did not enter
into such restrictions.

 

(d) Each Principal and each Seller agrees that a breach by such Person or
any Affiliate thereof of any covenant set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
would cause irreparable harm to Purchaser, that Purchasers remedies at law
upon any such breach would be inadequate, and that, accordingly, upon any such
breach, a restraining order or injunction or both may be issued against such
Person or such Affiliate, in addition to any other rights and remedies which
are available to Purchaser at law or in equity. Malibu and Purchaser agree
that a breach by such Person or any Affiliate thereof of any covenant set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ would cause irreparable harm to Sellers,
that Sellers remedies at law upon any such breach would be inadequate, and
that, accordingly, upon any such breach, a restraining order or injunction or
both may be issued against such Person or such Affiliate, in addition to any
other rights and remedies which are available to Sellers at law or in equity.
The parties specifically agree that the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are reasonable, appropriate and narrowly-tailored but
that if a court of competent jurisdiction finds this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ more
restrictive than permitted by the Laws of any jurisdiction in which a Person
seeks enforcement hereof, this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ will be limited to the
extent required to permit maximum enforcement thereof under such Laws. In
particular, the parties intend that the covenants contained in the preceding
portions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ will be construed as a series of
separate covenants, including one for

 



42

    

 each country, one for each state, province, or other first-level political
subdivision within each country, and one for each county or other second-level
political subdivision in each state, province, or other first-level political
subdivision. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant will
be deemed identical in terms. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court of
competent jurisdiction refuses to enforce any of the separate covenants
deemed included in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, then only such unenforceable
covenant will be deemed eliminated from these provisions for the purpose of
those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate
covenants to be enforced. In addition, if a court of competent jurisdiction
refuses to enforce any of the covenants throughout the full length of the
Restricted Period, the parties agree that the Restricted Period will be
deemed amended to the longest period that is permissible. In addition, and
without limiting any other remedies, the Restricted Period with respect to a
Person shall be extended for the period equal to the time period (if any) that
such Person is in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Confidentiality and Trade Secrets_.

(a) From and after the Closing, each Principal and each Seller shall, and
shall cause its controlled Affiliates and representatives to, (i) maintain
all Business Confidential Information in strict confidence and secrecy, (ii)
not use any Business Confidential Information that exclusively relates to the
Business for any purpose (except in the preparation of any Tax Returns or
financial statements of a Seller); (iii) not disclose any Business
Confidential Information to any Person other than Purchaser or its Affiliates
(or advisors of a Principal or Seller who are obligated to keep such Business
Confidential Information confidential and not use it other than to provide
professional advice to such Principal or Seller, it being agreed that such
Principal or Seller shall be liable for any non-compliance thereof by such
advisor); and (iv) not assist any other Person in engaging in any of the
foregoing, in each case, except to the extent necessary to comply with the
express terms of this Agreement or any other written agreement between a
Principal or Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, or
explicitly requested in writing by Purchaser; provided, however, Sellers may
disclose Business Confidential Information to potential purchasers of S2 or
all or substantially all of the assets of S2 or a line of business or
operating division of S2, but only if such disclosure is made under the
protection of a non-disclosure agreement pursuant to which the recipient of
such of Business Confidential Information is obligated to keep such Business
Confidential Information confidential and not use such Business Confidential
Information other than in connection with the evaluation of such potential
transaction, and, if such recipient ultimately consummates such purchase, its
use and disclosure of such Business Confidential Information shall be subject
to the same limitations as applicable to S2 hereunder. For clarity, from
and after the Closing, subject to the foregoing (and, for clarity, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_), Sellers and their controlled Affiliates and
representatives (and, for clarity, their respective employees in their
capacity as such) shall have the right to use and (except for Business
Confidential Information) disclose all of the confidential information and
trade secrets that are currently used in the Retained Business. 

(b) If a Seller or Principal is required by Law to disclose any Business
Confidential Information at any time after the Closing, then such Person
shall (to the extent legally permissible) provide Purchaser with prompt
written notice of such request or requirement to enable Purchaser (i) to seek
an appropriate protective order or other remedy or (ii) to consult with such
Person with respect to reasonable steps to be taken by such Person to resist
or narrow the scope of such request or legal process. If, in the absence of a
protective order, such Person is nonetheless compelled to disclose Business
Confidential Information, then such Person may disclose only such portion of
such Business Confidential Information as is required based on advice of
counsel, and such Person shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain reasonable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to
such portion of the Business Confidential Information required to be disclosed
as Purchaser shall reasonably designate.

 



43

    

(c) From and after the Closing, Malibu and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their controlled Affiliates and representatives to, (i) maintain
all Retained Business Confidential Information in strict confidence and
secrecy, (ii) not use any Retained Business Confidential Information that
exclusively relates to the Retained Business for any purpose; (iii) not
disclose any Retained Business Confidential Information to any Person other
than Sellers or its Affiliates (or advisors of Malibu or Purchaser who are
obligated to keep such Retained Business Confidential Information
confidential and not use it other than to provide professional advice to
Malibu or Purchaser, it being agreed that Malibu and Purchaser shall be liable
for any non-compliance thereof by such advisor); and (iv) not assist any
other Person in engaging in any of the foregoing, in each case, except to the
extent necessary to comply with the express terms of this Agreement or any
other written agreement between a Principal or Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, or explicitly requested in writing by S2;
provided, however, Purchaser or Malibu may disclose Retained Business
Confidential Information to potential purchasers of Purchaser or Malibu or
all or substantially all of the assets of Purchaser or Malibu or a line of
business or operating division of Purchaser or Malibu, but only if such
disclosure is made under the protection of a non-disclosure agreement
pursuant to which the recipient of such of Retained Business Confidential
Information is obligated to keep such Retained Business Confidential
Information confidential and not use such Retained Business Confidential
Information other than in connection with the evaluation of such potential
transaction, and, if such recipient ultimately consummates such purchase, its
use and disclosure of such Retained Business Confidential Information shall be
subject to the same limitations as applicable to Malibu and Purchaser
hereunder. For clarity, from and after the Closing, subject to the foregoing,
Malibu and Purchaser and their controlled Affiliates and representatives (and,
for clarity, their respective employees in their capacity as such) shall have
the right to use and (except for Retained Business Confidential Information)
disclose all of the confidential information and trade secrets of Sellers that
are currently used in the Business.

 

(d) If Malibu or Purchaser is required by Law to disclose any Retained
Business Confidential Information at any time after the Closing, then such
Person shall (to the extent legally permissible) provide Sellers with prompt
written notice of such request or requirement to enable Sellers (i) to seek an
appropriate protective order or other remedy or (ii) to consult with such
Person with respect to reasonable steps to be taken by such Person to resist
or narrow the scope of such request or legal process. If, in the absence of a
protective order, such Person is nonetheless compelled to disclose Retained
Business Confidential Information, then such Person may disclose only such
portion of such Retained Business Confidential Information as is required
based on advice of counsel, and such Person shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
shall be accorded to such portion of the Retained Business Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as S2 shall reasonably designate.

 

Section 6.9 _Press Releases_. Upon execution and delivery of this
Agreement by all of the Parties, Purchaser and S2 will issue a joint press
release announcing the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and, upon
the Closing, Purchaser and S2 will issue a joint press release announcing the
Closing. Other than the foregoing, no Seller or Principal shall make (or
permit its Affiliates to make) any public announcement or issue any press
release relating to the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of Purchaser, except as required by Law. For clarity, except as set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, Purchaser shall not be restricted in
making any public announcements or press releases.

 

Section 6.10 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the Agreement Date and terminating upon
the earlier to occur of the second anniversary of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 8.1_, each Seller and Principal agrees (i) to reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser to facilitate the transition to Purchaser from and after the
Closing of, with respect to the Business, the relationships with dealers and
distributors of the Business and (ii) to not intentionally take any action
inconsistent with the facilitation of such transition.

 



44

    

(b) From time to time following the Closing, each of the Parties shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and
deliver such conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases, consents, documents
and other instruments and papers, and perform such further acts, as may be
reasonably required or desirable to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including obtaining any Permits, consents, authorizations, approvals of, or
effecting the notification of or filing with, each Person, whether private or
governmental, whose consent or approval is required in order to permit the
consummation of, and to give full effect to, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 6.11 _Nonassignable Assets and Rights_.

 

(a) To the extent any consent, approval or waiver required to assign any
Purchased Asset to Purchaser has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing
Date, the related Purchased Asset for which such consent, approval or waiver
is required (a " _Delayed Asset_ ") shall not be transferred to Purchaser, and
any related Liability to the extent it constitutes an Assumed Liability (a "
_Delayed Liability_ ") shall not be assumed by Purchaser, in each case, unless
and until such consent, approval or waiver has been obtained in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. Following the Closing Date,
each Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser (at Purchasers sole
cost and expense) to obtain and have delivered to Purchaser all consents,
approvals and waivers necessary to transfer the Delayed Assets to Purchaser
as promptly as reasonably practicable and without any modification that would
adversely affect Purchaser, a Purchased Asset, an Assumed Liability, or the
Business.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, until all such Delayed Assets are
transferred, each Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in any reasonable
arrangement that will reflect as nearly as possible the respective benefits
and obligations that would have been in effect had the Delayed Assets and
Delayed Liabilities been transferred and assumed at the Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) each Seller shall
provide Purchaser with all of the benefits and rights intended to be assigned
in respect of such Delayed Assets, and Purchaser shall discharge any
corresponding Delayed Liabilities as and when obligated (subject to the right
of Purchaser to contest any such obligation in good faith) and (ii) each
Seller shall take all actions as Purchaser may reasonably request so as to
provide Purchaser with all such benefits and rights (including enforcement at
the cost and for the account of Purchaser of any and all rights of such Seller
under or relating to such Purchased Asset).

 

(c) At such time and on each occasion after the Closing that the required
consents, approvals or waivers shall be obtained with respect to any Delayed
Asset, such Delayed Asset shall automatically be deemed transferred and
assigned to Purchaser by the applicable Seller and all Delayed Liabilities
related to such Delayed Asset shall be simultaneously assumed by Purchaser.
Prior to any such transfer of Delayed Assets, each Seller shall preserve and
maintain such Delayed Assets for the benefit of Purchaser.

 

(d) Each Seller hereby grants to Purchaser a power of attorney to execute
and deliver on such Sellers behalf any applicable letters, demands, notices,
assignments and other instruments and documents required to be delivered by
Seller pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ to the extent necessary to give
effect to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ to the extent that such Seller does not
execute and deliver them within five Business Days of the request therefor by
Purchaser.

 

Section 6.12 _Post-Closing Deliveries_. From and after the Closing, each
Seller shall hold in trust for the benefit of Purchaser and promptly deliver
to Purchaser all cash, payments, other property, mail, faxes, documents,
communications, correspondence and other deliveries received directly or
indirectly by it with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities, in each case, other than with respect to the Excluded
Assets. From and after the Closing, Purchaser and Malibu shall hold in trust

 



45

    

 for the benefit of Seller and promptly deliver to Seller all cash, payments,
other property, mail, faxes, documents, communications, correspondence and
other deliveries received directly or indirectly by Purchaser or Malibu with
respect to the Retained Business, the Excluded Assets or the Excluded
Liabilities, including any accounts receivable or rebates of the Business
arising out of or related to the sale of Business Products prior to the
Closing.

Section 6.13 _Insurance_. Subject to the consent of the applicable
insurer, at the Closing, Sellers shall, with respect to each of the
Occurrence-Based Insurance Policies, ensure that Purchaser is added as an
additional insured (or loss payee, as applicable) with respect to Sellers
coverage thereunder for matters occurring on or prior to the Closing and
shall provide Purchaser with certificates of insurance evidencing all
coverages and endorsements; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers rights
under any such Occurrence-Based Insurance Policies shall be limited to Losses
of Purchaser related to the Business, Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities. After the Closing, Sellers shall not remove Purchaser as such
additional insured (or loss payee, as applicable) with respect to such
policies or otherwise adversely modify its right to file, notice and otherwise
pursue claims thereunder for matters occurring at or prior to the Closing.

occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, each Principal and Seller agrees that it

accordingly. In addition, if before or after the Closing it is discovered that
the list of Assigned Contracts does not include a dealer agreement between S2
and a dealer of the Business that was in effect on the Agreement Date or the
Closing Date, Purchaser may elect to cause such dealer agreement to be an
Assigned Contract, in which case, _Schedule_ __ _ 2.1(a)(vi)_ shall be

Agreement before the expiration of the applicable survival period shall
survive until such claim is finally resolved, notwithstanding the expiration
of any such survival period, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ shall

Section 9.2 _Indemnification_ _by Sellers_. Subject to the

their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, partners, members,
Affiliates, agents and representatives, and each of the heirs, executors,
successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (each a " _Purchaser
Indemnitee_ "), from any and all Claims, damages, losses, Liabilities,
demands, settlements, judgments, awards, obligations, fines, penalties,
Taxes, cost, interest or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by any of them,
whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, to the extent that such Losses
arise out of, relate to or result from: (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made by any Seller in this Agreement as of the
Agreement Date, or as of the Closing Date as if such representations or
warranties were made on and as of the Closing; (b) any breach by any Seller of
any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or (c) any
Excluded Liability.

such Losses arise out of, relate to or result from: (a) any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Malibu or Purchaser in
this Agreement as of the Agreement Date, or as of the Closing Date as if such
representations or warranties were made on and as of the Closing; (b) any
breach by Malibu or Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements contained

51

    

Section 9.4 _Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_.

(a) With respect to any indemnification sought under this _Article 9_ that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide
written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (an " _Notice of Claim_ ").
The Notice of Claim shall describe in reasonable detail (based on information
then available to the Indemnified Party) the nature of the claim, the
Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to such
claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification
under this _Article 9_.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within 20
days from its receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party
disputes such claim (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), the claim shall be resolved in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.11_. If the Indemnifying Party does not
timely deliver a Dispute Notice, or delivers a Dispute Notice that does not
object to all of the Losses set forth in the Indemnity Notice, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with all or
such unobjected-to portion of the claim, as applicable, and shall be
conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the Indemnified Party
of all or such unobjected-to portion of the Losses specified in the Indemnity
Notice and (ii) any objected-to portion of the claim shall be resolved in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.11_.

 

Section 9.5 _Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this _Article 9_
with respect to any Third Party Claim shall promptly provide a Notice of
Claim to the Indemnifying Party after receiving notice of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to so notify or any delay in
notifying the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party gives notice (the " _Notice of Assumption_
") to the Indemnified Party within 20 days after receipt of the applicable
Notice of Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of
the Third Party Claim and will indemnify the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend
such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by such Indemnifying Party and
who is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings shall be defended by the Indemnifying Party to
a final conclusion or settled in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_.
The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_  that
the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of a judgment or enter
into any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_, and the Indemnified Party shall bear
its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation; _provided_ that
if the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded that there is a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable costs and expenses of counsel to
the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Purchaser Indemnitee
shall have the full right to control the defense, compromise and settlement
of any Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if: (i) the
claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against a Purchaser
Indemnitee; (ii) the claim involves a claim by any Governmental Entity, a
criminal claim or a claim involving a significant dealer, distributor, sales
representative, supplier or other business partner of

 



52

    

 the Business; (iii) the claim involves claims for Losses in excess of the
remaining portion of the Cap after reduction of all Losses previously
recovered by (or then being claimed pursuant to unresolved claims) by the
Purchaser Indemnitees that count (or would count) towards the Cap (if the Cap
is applicable to such claim); or (iv) the Indemnifying Party fails to give the
Notice of Assumption within 20 days after receipt of the applicable Notice of
Claim or the Indemnifying Party timely gives the Notice of Assumption but
fails to promptly defend the Third Party Claim. Assumption by the Indemnified
Party of control of any such defense, compromise or settlement shall not
be deemed a waiver by it of its right to indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.5(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
(or is deemed to have elected not to) assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the determination of whether the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with _Section_ __ _
10.11_.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
cooperate with each other in contesting any Third Party Claim.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
provisions hereof dealing with Third Party Claims shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of the RWI Policy.

 

Section 9.6 _Other Indemnification Matters_.

 

(a) Absent actual fraud by any Seller or Principal: (i) Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses for any individual claim
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ unless the amount of Losses for such
individual claim (or the aggregate amount of Losses for all claims arising
from the same or a related matter, event or circumstance) is at least
$25,000; _provided_ that any such disregarded Losses for claims made pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ shall nonetheless count towards the Basket under
this _Section_ __ _ 9.6(a)_ if such Basket has not then already been
exceeded; (ii) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses
for claims made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ in respect of any breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty (other than the
representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_
(Organization), _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_ (Title to Assets), _Section_ __ _
4.3_ (Authority), _Section_ __ _ 4.15_ (Tax Matters), _Section_ __ _ 4.16_
(Brokers), and _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ (Transactions with Affiliates)) until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses thereunder exceeds $500,000 (the "
_Basket_ "), at which point Purchaser Indemnitees shall, subject to the
provisions of this _Article 9_ , be entitled to seek indemnification for all
such Losses thereunder in excess of the Basket (but not for the amount of the
Basket); (iii) the aggregate liability of Sellers for claims made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ in respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in
representations or warranties other than Fundamental Representations shall
not exceed $500,000 (the " _Cap_ "); and (iv) the aggregate liability of
Sellers for all claims made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (including in
respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in Fundamental Representations) shall
not exceed the Base Purchase Price.

(b) Absent actual fraud by Malibu or Purchaser: (i) Seller Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover Losses for any individual claim made pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ unless the amount of Losses for such individual
claim (or the aggregate amount of Losses for all claims arising from the same
or a related matter, event or circumstance) is at least $25,000; _provided_
that any such disregarded Losses for claims made pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(a)_ shall nonetheless count towards the Basket under this _Section_ __ _
9.6(b)_ if such Basket has not then already been exceeded; (ii) Seller
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses for claims made pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ in respect of any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty (other than Fundamental Representations) until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses thereunder exceeds the Basket, at which
point Seller Indemnitees shall, subject to the provisions of this _Article 9_
, be entitled to seek indemnification for all such Losses thereunder in excess
of the Basket (but not for the amount of the Basket); (iii) the aggregate
liability of Purchaser and Malibu for claims made

 



53

    

 pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ in respect of breaches of or
inaccuracies in representations or warranties other than Fundamental
Representations shall not exceed 10% of the Base Purchase Price; and (iv) the
aggregate liability of Purchaser and Malibu for all claims made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ (including in respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in
Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed the Base Purchase Price.

(c) For purposes of determining the amount of any Losses arising out of,
relating to or resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement, and for purposes of
determining whether or not such breach or inaccuracy has occurred, such
representations and warranties shall be considered without giving effect to
any limitation or qualification as to "material", "materially", "in all
material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or any other derivation of the
word "material", in any case, other than with respect to the use of the word
"material" in the term "Material Contract" itself.

 

(d) None of the Principals or Sellers nor any of their respective members,
managers, Affiliates, employees or agents (as applicable) shall have any
right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against
Purchaser or any other Person who owns, controls or operates the Purchased
Assets or the Business after the Closing in connection with
any indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which it may become
subject under or in connection with this Agreement, it being understood and
agreed that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
Sellers and Principals are solely for the benefit of Purchaser and the other
Purchaser Indemnitees.

(e) Without limiting the other limitations of this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_,
to the extent that coverage is available under the RWI Policy in respect of a
claim for indemnification, no Seller will have any liability pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_ in respect of such claim,
other than for the then remaining portion of the Retention (as such term is
defined in the RWI Policy), unless and until the Limit of Liability (as such
term is defined in the RWI Policy) is met or exceeded; _provided_ that, for
clarity, a notice of a claim under this _Article 9_ may nonetheless be given
at any time under and in accordance with (and subject to the requirements of)
this _Article 9_.

(f) To the extent coverage is or may be available under the RWI
Policy with respect to any particular Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2_, the Purchaser Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue such claim against the RWI Policy (but, for clarity, the Purchaser
Indemnitee shall not be under any obligation to institute any suit, action or
other proceeding against the insurers under such RWI Policy).

 

(g) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided to a
Purchaser Indemnitee under this _Article 9_ will be reduced by any amounts
actually received by Purchaser Indemnitee as a result of any indemnification,
contribution, insurance, or other payment by any third party, net of any
actual, out-of-pocket expenses of any Purchaser Indemnitee related to the
receipt of such amount, with respect to such Losses. The amount of any Losses
for which indemnification is provided to a Seller Indemnitee under this
_Article 9_ will be reduced by any amounts actually received by the Seller
Indemnitee as a result of any indemnification, contribution, insurance, or
other payment by any third party, net of any actual, out-of-pocket expenses
of any Seller Indemnitee related to the receipt of such amount, with respect
to such Losses.

 

(h) Each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts in accordance
with the requirements of applicable Law to mitigate Losses for which another
Party would otherwise be required to provide indemnification pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this _Article 9_.

 



54

    

(i) The right of any Purchaser Indemnitee to indemnification will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

 

(j) The Parties agree to treat any indemnification payments made pursuant
to this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax
purposes, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law as
reasonably determined by the Tax advisors of the Indemnified Party.

 

(k) The Parties agree that, other than claims for specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and claims for fraud and other
than claims in respect of post-Closing covenants, from and after the Closing,
the remedies provided in this _Article 9_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies for a breach of representations, warranties or covenants of any
Seller, Malibu or Purchaser contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any Purchaser
Indemnitee to make claims against the RWI Policy.

 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for clarity, nothing
in this _Article 9_ shall limit any claim resulting from actual fraud.

Section 9.7 _Satisfaction of Indemnification Claims; Escrow_. Any amount
determined to be owed to any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as
applicable, in satisfaction of any indemnification obligation pursuant to this
_Article 9_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds
from the applicable Person to an account designated in writing by the
applicable Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, within
five Business Days after the determination thereof; _provided_ that any
indemnification owed by any Seller to a Purchaser Indemnitee for claims made
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall first be satisfied from any funds
remaining in the Escrow Account to the extent of available funds in the
Escrow Account. Purchaser and S2 shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make any such distributions
from the Escrow Account. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event
within three Business Days) following the 12-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser and S2 shall direct the Escrow Agent to release to S2 all of
the remaining amounts in the Escrow Account, if any, in excess of an
amount (if any) (the " _Retained Amount_ ") that equals the total Losses then
subject to claims by Purchaser in all unresolved indemnification claims
pursuant to this _Article 9_ , which Retained Amount shall instead be retained
in the Escrow Account, and, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any
event within three Business Days) following resolution of each such claim,
Purchaser and S2 shall direct the Escrow Agent to release to S2 all of the
remaining amounts in the Escrow Account, if any, not then required to satisfy
any such claims that are still unresolved.

and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and
permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as

and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

Section 10.11 _Dispute Resolution_. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _
3.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.11(b)_, any controversy, claim or dispute
(including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement
to arbitrate) (" _Dispute_ ") among the Parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement will be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, which will be the sole and exclusive procedures
for the resolution of any such Dispute. The Parties intend that these
provisions will be valid, binding, enforceable and irrevocable and will
survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

(a) Any Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration with the
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service in Chicago, Illinois before a
single arbitrator. The parties to any such arbitration proceeding may obtain
discovery in aid of the arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law. All discovery disputes shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
Costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator, cost of any
record or transcript of the arbitration, administrative fees, and other fees
and costs shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Sellers. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies
that would be available in any judicial proceeding instituted in the state and
federal courts in Delaware to resolve a disputed matter. The arbitrator has
the power to award to the substantially prevailing party the reimbursement of
such partys reasonable attorneys fees and costs (including, but not limited
to, expert fees) as well as such administrative fees in connection with such
arbitration. Any dispute as to the reasonableness of any fee or cost will be
resolved by the arbitrator. Except as may be necessary to enter judgment upon
the award or to the extent required by applicable law, all claims, defenses
and proceedings (including, but not limited to, the existence of a controversy
and the fact that there is an arbitration proceeding) will be treated in a
confidential manner by the arbitrator and all those involved in the
proceeding. Any controversy relating to the arbitration presented to a court
will be filed under seal to the extent permitted by law. An arbitration award
rendered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ will be final and binding on
the parties and may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction for
entry of a judgment thereon.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the Parties agreement to submit all Disputes to final
and binding arbitration and the right of the arbitrator to grant any
equitable remedies as provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.11(a)_, the Parties shall
have the right to seek and obtain temporary or preliminary injunctive relief
or specific performance in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such courts
shall have authority to, among other things, grant temporary or provisional
injunctive relief (with such relief effective until the arbitrator has
rendered a final award) in order to protect any Partys rights under this
Agreement or otherwise.

Section 10.12 _Bulk Sales_. Purchaser and Sellers each hereby waive
compliance with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or similar
laws of any state.
