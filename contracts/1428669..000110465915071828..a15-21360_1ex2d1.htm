 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " **
_DGCL_** ") whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease,
and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " ** _Surviving
Corporation_** ").

 



 

(b) The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the " **
_Closing_** ") to occur at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US), 401 Congress
Avenue, Suite 2500, Austin, Texas 78701, on a date and at a time to be agreed
upon by Parent and the Company, which date shall be no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions at the Closing), or at such other location, date and time as Parent
and the Company shall mutually agree upon in writing. The date upon which the
Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the " **
_Closing Date_**."

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 1.1(b)_, if the Marketing Period has not ended
at the time when the Closing would otherwise be required to occur pursuant to
_Section 1.1(b)_, the Closing will occur on the earlier of (i) a Business Day
before or during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on three (3)
Business Days prior written notice to the Company and (ii) the first (1st)
Business Day after the expiration of the Marketing Period (subject, in each
case, to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of all
of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_, other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions
at the Closing), or at such other date and time as Parent and the Company
shall mutually agree upon in writing.

 



 

(d) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger in requisite and customary form and substance with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings
required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time (the " ** _Effective Time_** ") as the certificate of
merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or
at such later time as may be mutually agreed to by the parties and as
specified in the certificate of merger).

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Conversion of Shares of Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.2(b)_ or _Section 1.4_, each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the
right to receive $60.10 in cash, without interest (the " ** _Merger
Consideration_** ");

 



 

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of the Company or
Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

 



 

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " ** _Exchange Agent_** ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock (the " ** _Certificates_** ") or (ii) uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock (the " ** _Uncertificated Shares_** "). At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit and make available to the
Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (but not any Merger Consideration
in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration or the Company RSU
Merger Consideration) (the " ** _Exchange Fund_** "). All cash deposited with
the Exchange Agent shall only be used for the purposes provided in this
Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent before the
Effective Time. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation. Promptly after the Effective Time (but
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than the Company, Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent, or holders of
Dissenting Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of
appraisal) a letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated
Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No
interest or dividends will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay in
advance to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this _Article I_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this _Section 1.3_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section 1.4_ in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 1.2_, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with
_Section 1.2(b)_ and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption
of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly
exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such
shares being referred to collectively as the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** "
until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in
accordance with the DGCL; _ _ provided, however, that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
1.2(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case
may be, in compliance with _Section 1.3_. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent
shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL
consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. From and after the
Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the
Surviving Company or of a stockholder of Parent.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 1.5 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) Neither Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any Company Options
or substitute for any Company Option any option for Surviving Corporation or
Parent stock, in connection with the Merger or any of the Transactions. As of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of
Company Options, (i) all Unvested Company Options issued or granted prior to
the Agreement Date pursuant to the Stock Plans and which are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become
exercisable, and become Vested Company Options, and (ii) to the extent not
exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option shall be cancelled,
with each former holder of any such canceled Company Option becoming entitled
to receive, at the Effective Time, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Company Option, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section 1.6_),
equal to the product of: (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of each such Company Option; and (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option (the "
** _Company Option Merger Consideration_** "); provided, however, that if the
exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled and
terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company Option Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, at the Effective Time or as soon
practicable thereafter (but in no event later than the date which is the later
of (x) five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time and (y) the date of the
Companys first regularly scheduled payroll after the Effective Time).

 



 

(b) (i) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 1.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, neither Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume
any Company RSU or substitute for any Company RSU any similar award for
Surviving Corporation or Parent stock, in connection with the Merger or any of
the Transactions. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action
on the part of any holder of Company RSUs, (A) all Unvested Company RSUs
issued or granted prior to the Agreement Date pursuant to the Specified Plans
and which are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
fully vest and become Vested Company RSUs as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) except as otherwise set forth on _Section 1.5_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time, and, in
exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder
of any such Company RSU an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section 1.6_)
equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (the " ** _Company
RSU Merger Consideration_** "). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay the Company RSU Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, at the
Effective Time or as soon practicable thereafter (but in no event later than
the date which is the later of (1) five (5) Business Days after the Effective
Time and (2) the date of the Companys first regularly scheduled payroll after
the Effective Time); provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU which
immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement
date for such Company RSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of
the Code

 



 

(ii) Each Unvested Company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that was issued or granted pursuant to the 2015 Plan (the "
** _2015 Company RSUs_** ") shall not become a Vested Company RSU and shall
instead be cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive the
per share Company RSU Merger Consideration; provided that such per share
Company RSU Merger Consideration shall not be paid at the Effective Time but
shall instead be

 



      
 

 



 

subject to the holder of such 2015 Company RSUs being continuously employed
with the Surviving Corporation until the date of the satisfaction of the
original vesting conditions applicable to the underlying 2015 Company RSU.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the per share Company RSU
Merger Consideration applicable to such 2015 Company RSUs, without interest
thereon, upon the satisfaction of the underlying vesting conditions applicable
thereto or as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than the
date which is the later of (A) five (5) Business Days after the date the
vesting conditions are satisfied and (B) the date of the Companys first
regularly scheduled payroll after such times; provided that any payment in
respect of any 2015 Company RSU which, immediately prior to such cancellation
was treated as "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the
Code, shall be made on the applicable settlement date of such 2015 Company RSU
if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(c) The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Stock Plans) and the Company, as applicable, shall take such actions as
are necessary and reasonably satisfactory to Parent (i) to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.5_, including making
any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof or any administrator of a Stock Plan as may be necessary and (ii) to
provide that following the Effective Time no participant in any Stock Plan
will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that such actions shall not include the obligation to seek
any consent, acknowledgment, representation, covenant or release from any
holder of any Company Equity Award.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Withholding Rights_ _. _Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving
Corporation, Parent and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Company, Exchange Agent,
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, as the
case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, as applicable, in
respect of which the Company, Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, made such deduction
and withholding.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Lost Certificates_ _. _If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the delivery by such Person of a written indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and which
indemnity shall not require the posting by such Person of a bond, the Exchange
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article I_.

 



 

Section 1.8 _No Further Dividends_ _._ No dividends or other distributions
with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date
on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any surrendered
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Reports (excluding, in each case,
(x) any disclosures contained or referenced therein (other than those
disclosures which relate to specific historical events or circumstances
affecting the Company) under the captions "Risk Factors," "Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk" and any other disclosures contained therein to
the extent they are cautionary in nature and (y) any exhibits or other
documents appended thereto) filed or furnished by the Company with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " ** _SEC_** ") prior to the
Agreement Date; provided that nothing disclosed in any Company SEC Report will
be deemed to modify or qualify the representations and warranties in _Section
3.2_ or (ii) the Company Disclosure Schedules (each Section of which qualifies
the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
extent specified therein, _provided_ that any disclosure set forth with
respect to any particular Section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference
to all other applicable sections of this Agreement if the disclosure in
respect of the particular Section is sufficient on its face without further
inquiry reasonably to inform Parent of the information required to be
disclosed in respect of such other sections) delivered by the Company to
Parent on the Agreement Date (the " ** _Company Disclosure Schedules_** "),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Merger Subsidiary and Parent as
follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization_. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company (the " ** _Company Subsidiaries_** ") is a corporation, limited
liability company, limited partnership or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization where the character of its properties owned
or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary
(to the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all
requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals, the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company which
are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Companys Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (the " ** _Company
Charter Documents_** ") are complete and correct copies of such documents and
contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the Agreement Date.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 123,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.001 per share, (" ** _Company Preferred Stock_**"). As of the

were subject to issuance pursuant to outstanding Company RSUs; and (f)
5,611,719 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for the future grant of
Company Equity Awards under the Stock Plans (excluding shares reserved for
issuance upon exercise of the Company Options or settlement of the Company
RSUs). Such issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been,
and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any Stock Plan or as
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement will be, when issued in accordance
with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued, or in
the case of shares that have not yet been issued, will be, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company of any kind to redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.
Other than the Company Common Stock, there are no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other Indebtedness or securities of the Company having
the right to vote (or, other than the outstanding Company Equity Awards,
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote. Except for the
Voting Agreements, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party
to any agreement relating to the voting of, requiring registration of, or
granting any preemptive rights, anti-dilutive right or rights of first refusal
or similar rights with respect to any Company securities or securities of any
wholly-owned Company Subsidiary. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules sets forth a list of the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs
as of the Capitalization Date, including (to the extent applicable) the date
on which each such Company Option or Company RSU was granted, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company RSU,
the expiration date of such Company Option and the price at which such Company
Option may be exercised (if any) under an applicable Stock Plan and the

no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company are
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and (ii) there are no
outstanding securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,
agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound
obligating the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company or of any of the Company
Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions are within the
Companys corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the
Companys stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock is the

 



      
 

 



 

only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Merger (the " ** _Company Stockholder
Approval_** "). Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent

contemplated hereby, and (iii) resolved, subject to _Section 5.3_, to
recommend approval of this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation,
the " ** _Company Board Recommendation_** ").

and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions require no action by
or in respect of or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i)
the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,
(ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar applicable Law of the
jurisdictions outside of the United States set forth in _Section 3.3(c)_ of

applicable rules of the NYSE, (v) compliance with Part 800 of 31 C.F.R.,
including 31 C.F.R. secs. 800.402 and 800.601, and guidance, as amended, of
the regulations of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States,
and (vi) any additional actions or filings, except those the failure of which
to make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions do not and will not (i) contravene,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or similar
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in _Section 3.3(c)_, contravene, conflict with
or result in a material violation or breach of any provision of any applicable
Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section
3.3(c)_, require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a
default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or the loss of any material benefit to which the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is entitled under any Company
Material Contract, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any asset of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, with only such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (iii) and (iv), as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a complete and
accurate list as of the Agreement Date of each of the Company Subsidiaries and
their respective jurisdictions of organization.

 



 

(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities
of, or other ownership interests in, each Company Subsidiary are, where
applicable, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and
such shares, securities or interests are owned by the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

by a Company Subsidiary free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted
Liens) or limitations on voting rights that would prevent the operation by the
Surviving Corporation of such Company Subsidiarys business as presently
conducted. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
convertible securities or other agreements or commitments of any character
relating to the issuance, transfer, sales, delivery, voting or redemption
(including any rights of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security
or other instrument) for any of the capital stock or other Equity Interests
of, or other ownership interests in, any Company Subsidiary. Other than the
Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock and/or other ownership interest in any Person.

 



 

Section 3.5 _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2013, the Company has timely filed or furnished with the
SEC all forms, reports, schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy
statements and other documents (the forms, reports, schedules, registration
statements, definitive proxy statements and other documents filed or furnished
by the Company since the January 1, 2013 and those filed or furnished by the
Company subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto,
collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the " ** _Company SEC Reports_**
") required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC. As of their
respective filing dates, and giving effect to any amendments or supplements
thereto filed prior to the Agreement Date, the Company SEC Reports complied in
all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, and the respective rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports. None of the
Company Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents
with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act. As of its
filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Agreement
Date, on the date of such amended or superseded filing), each Company SEC
Report did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 



 

(b) As of the Agreement Date, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in any comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC
Reports.

 



 

(c) The consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders equity and cash flows (including, in each case, any
related notes and schedules thereto) of the Company contained or incorporated
by reference in the Company SEC Reports comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in conformity
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as otherwise noted therein or to the extent required by GAAP) and
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position
and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as of the dates or for the periods presented therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
adjustments).

 



 

(d) The Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is sufficient
in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are executed in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that would materially affect the Companys financial
statements. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2014, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective and did not identify any (A) significant deficiency or material
weakness in the design or operation of internal controls or (B) fraud or
allegation of fraud, whether or not

 



      
 

 



 

material, that involves the Companys management or other employees who have a
significant role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal
accounting controls utilized by the Company and Company Subsidiaries (nor has
any such significant deficiency, material weakness or fraud been identified
between December 31, 2014 and the Agreement Date).

 



 

(e) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that (i) all material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the individuals responsible
for preparing such reports within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and (ii) all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(f) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all rules,
regulations and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 1, 2013,
the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the
Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has
received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications.

 



 

(g) Since January 1, 2013, the Company has complied in all material respects
with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
NYSE.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any
Liabilities required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company (or the notes thereto) other than (i) Liabilities disclosed,
reflected or otherwise reserved against in the Balance Sheet (or the notes
thereto) or as described in the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 (or the notes
thereto), (ii) Liabilities incurred after December 31, 2014 in the ordinary

Transactions, (v) executory obligations under any Contract (none of which is a
Liability for a breach thereof), and (vi) Liabilities that would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Absence of Material Adverse Changes, etc_. Since July 1, 2015
and through the Agreement Date and except for actions expressly contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted
their business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. Since July 1, 2015, there has not been or
occurred any event, condition, change, occurrence or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since July 1, 2015, the Company has
not taken any action that would be prohibited by clauses (i), (iv) or (xii) of
_Section 5.2(b)_ if taken or proposed to be taken after the Agreement Date.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, to which the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party that, individually or in the aggregate has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There
are no Orders outstanding against the Company or any of the Company

LLC or its Affiliates (the " ** _Company Financial Advisor_** ") no agent,
broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of the Company or any Company

(a) _Section 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a complete

coverage).

listed on _Annex I_ hereto (the " ** _Equity Financing Sources_**" and
together with the Debt Financing Sources, the " ** _Financing Sources_** ")
confirming the respective counterparties commitments to provide Parent with
equity financing in an amount up to the aggregate amount set forth therein in
connection with the Transactions (the " ** _Equity Financing_** ," and
together with the Debt Financing, the " ** _Financing_** "). Assuming that the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters is fully funded on
the terms set forth therein, Parent and Merger Subsidiary will have at and
after the Closing funds sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective Representatives pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of the Equity Commitment Letters is in full force and effect as of
the Agreement Date and is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The
Company is a third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letters on the
terms set forth therein. Each of the Debt Commitment Letters is in full force
and effect as of the Agreement Date and is a valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto. Parent or Merger Subsidiary has fully paid, or caused to be
fully paid, any and all commitment or other fees in connection with the
Financing Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to the Agreement
Date. As of the Agreement Date, none of the Financing Commitment Letters have
been amended or modified in any respect, no such amendment or modification is
contemplated (other than with respect to any "market flex" terms contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter, to the extent such "market flex" terms may be
deemed an amendment or modification) and the respective commitments contained
therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any
respect. As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any Financing
Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing other than the conditions precedent set forth in
the Financing Commitment Letters, and, as of the Agreement Date, Parent has no
reason to believe that any term or condition of closing of the Financing that
is required to be satisfied will not be satisfied, or that the Financing will
not be made available to Parent on the date of the Closing. There are no side
letters or other Contracts to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party
(i) related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of
the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letters, (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

awarding any Person any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis or (iii)
prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any Person from providing or seeking to
provide financing to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to
the Company.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Guaranties_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranties. Each
Guaranty is in full force and effect as of the Agreement Date and constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of the respective Guarantor, enforceable
against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity). As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of any Guarantor under the
applicable Guaranty.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantors or
the Equity Financing Sources is entering into this Agreement with the intent
to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary is
Solvent as of the Agreement Date, and each of Parent and the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will, after giving effect to
the Merger or the Transactions, including the funding of the Financing payment
of the Merger Consideration, and payment of all other amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of all related fees
and expenses, and assuming the representations and warranties in _Article
III_ are true and correct in all material respects, be Solvent at and after
the Closing. As used in this _Section 4.11_, the term " ** _Solvent_** "
shall mean, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum
of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and, after the Closing, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) and of each of
them (on a stand-alone basis) will exceed their debts, (b) Parent and, after
the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) and each of them (on a stand-alone basis) has not incurred and does not
intend to incur, and does not believe that it will incur, debts beyond its
ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (c) Parent has and, after
the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) and each them (on a stand-alone basis) will have, sufficient capital
and liquidity with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this
_Section 4.11_, " ** _debt_** " means any liability on a claim, and " **
_claim_** " means any (i) right to payment, whether or not such a right is
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and
(ii) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach
gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is
reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 



 

Section 4.12 _Certain Arrangements_. Except the Voting Agreements, there are
no Contracts or commitments to enter into Contracts (a) between Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, or (b) pursuant to which any stockholder of
the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder
of the Company agrees to vote to approve this Agreement or the Merger or
agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

 



 

Section 4.13 _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except as and
only to the extent expressly set forth in the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article III_, Merger Subsidiary and Parent hereby acknowledge
and agree that: (a) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries, or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, has

Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person; and (b) except in the case
of Fraud, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation or other obligation of
any kind or nature to Merger Subsidiary, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, resulting from the
delivery, dissemination or any other distribution to Merger Subsidiary, Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person,
or the use by Merger Subsidiary, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives or any other Person, of any such information provided or
made available to any of them by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person,
including any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or
other forward-looking information, business plans or other material provided
or made available to Merger Subsidiary, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, in "data rooms,"
confidential information memoranda or management presentations in anticipation
or contemplation of the Merger or any of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 4.14 _Non-Reliance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge (each for itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) that, as of the Agreement Date,

hosted by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) have had reasonable opportunity to meet with the management
of the Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company.

and Representatives have received and may continue to receive after the
Agreement Date from the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its
business and operations. Merger Subsidiary and Parent hereby acknowledge and
agree that: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, with which Merger Subsidiary and Parent are
familiar; (b) Merger Subsidiary and Parent are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans); and (c) except in the case of Fraud, Merger
Subsidiary and Parent hereby waive any claim against the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
with respect to any information described in this _Section 4.14_, and have
relied solely on the results of their own independent investigation and on the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by the Company and
contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, Merger Subsidiary and Parent hereby
acknowledge and agree that none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, has made or is
making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans).

reasonably be expected to cause, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their
controlled Affiliates to be deemed an "interested stockholder" as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL.

failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and may also terminate this Agreement

intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
circumstances giving rise to such proposed action, including, in the case such
action is proposed to be taken in connection with a Superior Proposal, the
information specified by _Section 5.3(c)_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal;

 



 

(iii) the Company shall have during the Notice Period, negotiated with Parent
and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that in the event of any material revisions to the terms of
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
Determination Notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of _Section
5.3(e)(ii)_ and this _Section 5.3(e)(iii)_ with respect to such new
Determination Notice and the revised Superior Proposal contemplated thereby;

 



 

(iv) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors
and its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would continue
to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in
writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination pursuant to clause
(iii) above); and

 



      
 

 



 

(v) in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_ including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.4(a)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to the
Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Companys
stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communications to the Companys stockholders); provided, however,
that the Company Board shall not make or resolve to make a Change of
Recommendation except in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_.

 



 

(g) _Existing Discussions_. Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company agrees that it will, and will instruct and cause the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions, solicitations or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall cease providing any information to any such
Person or its Representatives and terminate all access granted to any such
Person and its Representatives to any physical or electronic data room. The
Company will, as promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date, deliver
a written notice to each Person that has previously executed a confidentiality
or similar agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition
Proposal requesting that such Person return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in accordance
with the terms of such confidentiality or similar agreement.

 



 

(h) _Breach By Representatives_. The Company agrees that any breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by any of its Representatives (other than immaterial or
inadvertent breaches not intended to result in an Acquisition Proposal) shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Proxy Filing_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the Agreement Date (and in any event no later than 15
Business Days), a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the
Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or
supplement thereto, the " ** _Proxy Statement_** ") and, subject to _Section
5.3_, shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Each of Parent and the Company shall provide the other with the information
contemplated by _Section 5.6(c)_ and shall otherwise reasonably assist and
cooperate with the other in connection with any of the actions contemplated by
this _Section 5.4_, including the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments in respect thereof received
from the SEC.

 



 

(b) If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other
than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant
to applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an " ** _Other
Required Company Filing_** "), then the Company shall prepare and file as soon
as practicable such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any
Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC
and the NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing with the SEC, or respond to any SEC comments thereon,
without providing Parent and its counsel, to the extent practicable, a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, which comments shall be
considered by the Company in good faith.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information relating
to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, or any Other Required Company Filing, as
the case may be, so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then the party that discovers such
information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement to such filing describing such information will be prepared and
filed as soon as practicable with the SEC by the Company and, to the extent
required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all action
necessary to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of holders of the Common Stock (the " ** _Stockholders
Meeting_** ") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement.
Following the distribution of the Proxy Statement pursuant to _Section 5.4_,
without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may not adjourn or
postpone the Stockholders Meeting. Once established, the record date of the
Stockholders Meeting may not be changed without the consent of Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as required by applicable
Law. In the event that the date of the Stockholders Meeting as originally
called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the
Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing, it
shall implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way
that the Company does not establish a new record date for the Stockholders
Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed. Subject to _Section 5.3(e)_,
the Company shall solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, and the
Company Board shall recommend such adoption and shall take all lawful action
to solicit such adoption of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VII_, the Company
shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, whether or not the Company Board at any
time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent,
advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last 10 Business Days
prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of
the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder
Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters) which the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the Companys stockholders at the
Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification._

 



 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other of the receipt
of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to
Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all
comments received in respect of the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company
shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than five (5) business days)
after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon
or

 



      
 

 



 

that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement (the " ** _SEC
Clearance Date_** "); provided that on the 10th calendar day after the filing
of the preliminary Proxy Statement if the SEC has not affirmatively notified
the Company during such period that it will or will not be reviewing the Proxy
Statement then the Company shall contact the SEC on such date regarding the
preliminary Proxy Statement and if no response is received from the SEC then
the second Business Day after such contact will be deemed the SEC Clearance
Date. If necessary in order to comply with applicable securities Laws after
the Proxy Statement shall have been so disseminated, the Company shall
disseminate as soon as practicable amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy
material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws, including the Antitrust Laws, to
consummate and make effective the Merger as soon as practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable (and in any event shall make
all filings pursuant to the HSR Act within ten (10) days of the Agreement
Date) all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other
filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in order to consummate
the Merger and the Transactions. The Company and Parent will each request
early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the
HSR Act and, where available, under applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws. The
Company and Parent, and their respective Subsidiaries, shall (i) keep one
another promptly apprised of any communications received from a Governmental
Authority concerning the Merger and of the other Transactions; (ii) respond as
promptly as practicable to all requests for additional information from a
Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law concerning the Merger or any of
the Transactions; (iii) provide each other in advance, with a reasonable
opportunity for review and comment, drafts of contemplated communications with
any Governmental Authority concerning the Merger or any of the other
Transactions; and (iv) provide each other advance notice of all meetings,
conferences, or discussions with a Governmental Authority concerning the
Merger or the other Transactions, and, unless prohibited by the Governmental
Authority, permit one another to attend and participate therein either
directly or through counsel. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, and subject to reasonable confidentiality
considerations, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of
the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and the Transactions. In exercising
the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with
respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon Closing.

 



 

(c) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters in each case as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger, and shall provide the other party with final
copies of any filings made with a Governmental Authority, with the exception
of material responsive to a request for additional information from Government
Antitrust Entities.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Authority, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the Merger,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger and the Transactions. Neither the Company
nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other Representatives to
participate in any meeting or substantive telephone discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry with respect to the Merger unless, to the extent legally permissible
and reasonably practicable, (i) it consults with the other party in advance
and (ii) to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or
substantive telephone discussion.

 



 

(e) _Regulatory Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings
pursuant to this _Section 5.6_, each of the Company and Parent agree to take
or cause to be taken the following actions: the prompt provision to each and
every federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Laws
(" ** _Government Antitrust Entity_** ") of non-privileged information and
documents requested by any Government Antitrust Entity or that are necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will be required to
agree to the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration (including increased or accelerated payments) or the provision
of additional security (including a guaranty), in connection with the Merger,
including in connection with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Company
Material Contract, (ii) in no event will the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Subsidiary be required to take or commit to
take any actions that would be reasonably likely to materially adversely
impact or impose limitations on the ownership by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries of all or a material portion of the Companys business or assets
and (iii) in no event will Parent or Merger Subsidiary be obligated pursuant
to this Agreement to, and the Company will not, without the written consent of
Parent, sell, divest, license or hold separate any capital stock or other
equity or voting interests or a material portion of the Companys business or
assets.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the
Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Merger shall be a joint press release and thereafter (unless and until a
Change of Recommendation has occurred) the Company and Parent each shall
consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the Transactions
and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority (including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service) with respect thereto, except in all cases as may be required by Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Authority.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.9 _Financing and Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary will not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to,
(i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity
Financing is increased by an equivalent amount) or reduce the aggregate amount
of the Equity Financing, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other
terms (except in connection with any "market flex" terms contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters provided as of the Agreement Date) to the Financing, or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay, prevent
or materially impede the consummation of the Merger, or (B) make the timely
funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Financing, less likely to occur in any respect, or (iii) adversely impact
the ability of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company, as applicable, to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitment
Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall not release or consent to the termination of the Debt
Commitment Letters or of any individual lender under the Debt Commitment
Letters, except for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender
under the terms of, and only in connection with, the syndication of the Debt
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letters, or (y) replacements of the Debt
Commitment Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to _Section
5.9(c)_.

 



 

(b) _Equity Financing_. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall take (or
cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing, including by
(i) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment Letters, (ii) complying with
its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letters, (iii) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in such
Equity Commitment Letters that are within its control, if any, (iv) enforcing
its rights under the Equity Commitment Letters and (v) consummating the Equity
Financing at or prior to Closing, including by causing the Equity Financing
Sources to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing, in each case in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters.

 



 

(c) _Debt Financing and Alternate Debt Financing_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and obtain the financing
contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any flex provisions) set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its obligations under
the Debt Commitment Letters, (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
that are no less favorable to Merger Subsidiary than the terms contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to
funding that are applicable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary in the Debt
Commitment Letters and the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (v) enforce its rights
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters, and (vi) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing on the terms and conditions contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters, including by causing the Debt Financing
Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other
fees arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters as and when they become
due. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain

 



      
 

 



 

alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not
less favorable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary than those set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing
or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the " ** _Alternative
Debt Financing_** "), and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment
letters with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (the " ** _New Debt
Commitment Letters_** "), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the
existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent shall promptly
provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and a
redacted fee letter in connection therewith (of which only the fee amounts,
price caps and economic "flex" terms have been redacted; provided that such
redacted terms do not affect the conditionality of or the amount of Debt
Financing to be funded at the Closing)). In the event that any New Debt
Commitment Letters are obtained, any reference in this Agreement to (A) the
"Financing Commitment Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed
to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by one or
more New Debt Commitment Letters at the time in question and any New Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, (B) the "Financing" or the
"Debt Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing, and (C) the "Debt Financing
Sources" will be deemed to include the Persons signatory to the New Debt
Commitment Letters.

 



 

(d) _Information_. Parent shall as reasonably requested by the Company, (i)
keep the Company fully informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing, and (ii) provide the Company with copies
of all executed definitive agreements related to the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
promptly notify the Company (a) of any breach (or threatened breach) or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by
any party to the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related
to the Financing, (b) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any
oral or written notice or communication from any Financing Source or with
respect to any breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or
repudiation by any party to a Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing, and (c) if for any reason Parent or
Merger Subsidiary at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing. Parent shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances
referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in
any event within one (1) Business Day) after the date that the Company
delivers a written request therefor to Parent.

 



 

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Subsidiary each acknowledge
and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

 



 

(f) _Company Support_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts, and will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to use its respective
reasonable best efforts, to provide Parent with all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent to assist it in causing the conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letters to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Financing, including:

 



 

(A) participating (and causing senior management and Representatives, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company, to participate) in a
reasonable and limited number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and
otherwise cooperating with the marketing efforts for any of the Debt
Financing;

 



      
 

 



 

(B) reasonably assisting Parent and the Debt Financing Sources with the timely
preparation of customary (i) rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda, lender presentations and similar documents required in connection
with the Debt Financing; (ii) high-yield Offering Documents, prospectuses,
memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the Financing; and
(iii) forecasts of financial statements of the Surviving Corporation for one
or more periods following the Closing;

 



 

(C) reasonably assisting Parent in connection with the preparation and
registration of (but not executing, unless effective only at or following the
Effective Time) any pledge and security documents, supplemental indentures,
currency or interest hedging arrangements and other definitive financing
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Debt Financing
Sources (including using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing and accountants comfort letters, in each case as reasonably
requested by Parent), and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of the Debt
Financing, it being understood that such documents will not take effect until
the Effective Time;

 



 

(D) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Sources, as promptly as
practicable, with all Required Information. If the Company in good faith
reasonably believes that it has provided the Required Information, it may
deliver to Parent a written notice stating when it believes that it completed
such delivery, in which case the Company will be deemed to have complied with
this _Section 5.9(f)(i)(D)_ and the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have
commenced as of such date unless Parent or the Debt Financing Source in good
faith reasonably believe that the Company has not completed delivery of the
Required Information and, within three (3) Business Days after the delivery of
such notice by the Company, deliver a written notice to the Company to that
effect, stating in good faith the specific items of Required Information the
Company has not delivered, in which case such Required Information shall be
deemed to have been delivered and the Marketing Period to have commenced when
such specific items have been delivered by the Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, such Required Information will be deemed to
not have been delivered if, at any point prior to the completion of the Debt
Financing, (1) such Required Information contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make
such Required Information, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; (2) such Required Information is not compliant in
all material respects with all requirements of Regulation S-K and Regulation
S-X under the Securities Act (excluding information required by Regulation S-X
Rule 3-10 and Regulation S-X Rule 3-16) for offerings of debt securities on a
registration statement on Form S-1 or sufficient to permit such a registration
statement on Form S-1 from being declared effective by the SEC; (3) the
Companys auditors have withdrawn any audit opinion with respect to any
financial statements contained in the Required Information; (4) with respect
to any interim financial statements (including any corresponding predecessor
periods), such interim financial statements have not been reviewed by the
Companys auditors as provided in the procedures specified by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board in AU 722; and (5) the Companys auditors
have not delivered drafts of customary comfort letters, including as to
customary negative assurances and change period, or such auditors indicated
that they are not prepared to issue such comfort letter; provided that after
commencement of the Marketing Period, the delivery of additional financial
statements or pro forma financial information requested by Parent (other than
information required due to the passage of time) and required to be delivered
pursuant to this _Section 5.9(f)(i)(D)_ shall not terminate or restart the
Marketing Period;

 



      
 

 



 

(E) cooperating with Parent to obtain customary and reasonable corporate and
facilities ratings, consents, landlord waivers and estoppels, non-disturbance
agreements, non-invasive environmental assessments, legal opinions, surveys
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, including in connection
with any arrangements to be effectuated after the Closing;

 



 

(F) reasonably facilitating the pledging or the reaffirmation of the pledge of
collateral (including obtaining and delivering any pay-off letters and other
cooperation in connection with the repayment or other retirement of existing
indebtedness and the release and termination of any and all related liens) on
or prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(G) delivering notices of prepayment within reasonable time periods required
by the relevant agreements governing indebtedness and obtaining customary
payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered
at the Closing, and giving any other necessary notices, to allow for the
payoff, discharge and termination in full at the Closing of all indebtedness;

 



 

(H) providing executed authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or
investors and containing a representation to the Debt Financing Sources that
the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material
non-public information about the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
securities and executing ratings agency engagement letters as required in
connection with the Debt Financing (provided, that the Company shall not be
required to pay any cost or expenses relating to rating agency engagement
letters);

 



 

(I) taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to (1) permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing (including, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
distributing the proceeds of the Debt Financing, if any, obtained by any the
Company Subsidiary to the Surviving Corporation), and (2) cause the direct
borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Debt Financing,
including any high-yield debt financing, by the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries concurrently with or immediately following the Effective
Time; and

 



 

(J) furnishing Parent and the Debt Financing Sources promptly (and in any
event at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (to the extent
requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date)) with all
documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities
pursuant to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.9(f)(i)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any terms of
this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent, (B) enter into any definitive
agreement (other than with respect to authorization letters and ratings agency
engagement letters referred to in _Section 5.9(f)(i)(H)_ that is effective
prior to the Closing, (C) give any indemnities in connection with the
Financing that are effective prior to the Effective Time, (D) take any action
that, in the good faith determination of the Company, would unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business or the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (E)
provide any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted
under applicable Law or is legally privileged (provided that in the event that

Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under
any and all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors
and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " **
_Indemnified Persons_** "). In addition, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to) cause
the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational

advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Agreement
Date, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be repealed,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable
Law.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification_. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of
_Section 5.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or
indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of
whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior
to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the Transactions;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section 5.10(b)_, then the
claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In
the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the
Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to
object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder
with respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall
elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person promptly after
statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.10(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of
its Affiliates (including Parent) shall, without the prior written consent of
the effected Indemnified Person (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 



 

(c) _Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation

the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" ** _D andO
Insurance_**") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company
elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
the Surviving Corporation (and Parent under the first sentence of this
_Section 5.10(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in
full force and effect. In satisfying its obligations under this _Section
5.10_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company
for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%)
amount, the " ** _Maximum Annual Premium_** "); _provided_ that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.

 



 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (or Parent) set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

(e) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.10_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person
who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail"

 



      
 

 



 

policy referred to in _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_, with
full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 5.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 5.10_ shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).

 



 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations and liability of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries under this
_Section 5.10_ shall be joint and several.

shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
5.10_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent of all Legal Proceedings commenced or
threatened in writing against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (" **
_Transaction Litigation_** ") (including by providing copies of all pleadings
with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall (a) give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with respect to the
defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. Further,
the Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any
Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For
purposes of this _Section 5.11_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-
client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect
to such Transaction Litigation, but will not be afforded any decision-making
power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the
settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Merger Subsidiary, Parent and the Company shall
take all such steps as may be reasonably required to cause the Transactions,
and any other dispositions of equity securities (including derivative

each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

commissions and severance, but to exclude any equity or equity-based
compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses,
and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits (excluding, any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits) that are, in the aggregate,
no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based
compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses,
and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits (excluding, any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits) being provided to Covered
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Plans set

under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (" **
_Parent Employee Benefit Plan_** ") during the Continuation Period, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for Covered Employees who
become eligible during the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i)
waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered Employee
participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under
any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount
was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the employee benefit
plan Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the
Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to recognize, the
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company
(or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit
accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, as applicable) to the
same extent and for the same purpose as such Covered Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this _Section
5.13(d)_ result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall (i) be construed to limit the right
of Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including,

agreement or arrangement to the extent such amendment or termination is

particular Person for any fixed period of time following the Effective Time;
or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person
(including any Covered Employee).

to be satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject

publicly known and not withdrawn, and (C) within one (1) year following the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_, a Competing
Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into an

consummation of such Competing Acquisition Transaction, the Company shall pay
to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee, less the amount of
Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)._ " **
_Company Termination Fee_** " means an amount equal to $159,000,000.

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, then as a condition to such termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent.

 



 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section

immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent.

 



 

(iv) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether nor not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under
more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times
and the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(b) _Parent Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_, or (B) pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ if, at the
time of such termination, the Company would have been entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_, then within
one (1) Business Day after demand by the Company, Parent shall pay to the
Company a fee equal to $318,000,000 (the " ** _Parent Termination Fee_** ") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts

(ii) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether nor not the Parent Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 



 

(c) _Recovery_. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company hereby acknowledge
and agree that the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.4_ are an integral
part of this Agreement and the Merger, and that, without these agreements,
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_ and, in order to

 



      
 

 



 

obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amount set forth in _Section 7.4(a)_ or any portion thereof
or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in _Section 7.4(b)_ or
any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company will pay to Parent or Parent
will pay to the Company, as the case may be, the other partys out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs) in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount
or portion thereof at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate
as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such
payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such
payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) _Parent Expenses_. In the event (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(h)_ under circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)(i)_
or (ii) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case after
the Agreement Date (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced
intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to the date of
termination) and this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, and as of the time of such termination by Parent, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary were not in material breach of their representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements under this Agreement, then within one (1) Business Day
after demand by Parent, the Company shall pay to Parent up to $5,000,000 of
Parents reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to
the termination of this Agreement in connection with the Transactions
(including the Financing) (the " ** _Parent Expenses_** ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent; provided, that the existence of circumstances which could require the
Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.4(a)(i)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to
pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.4(d)_; provided, further,
that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section
7.4(d)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)(i)_ except to the extent
indicated in _Section 7.4(a)(i)_.

 



 

(e) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that:

 



 

(i) the agreements contained in this _Section 7.4_ are an integral part of
the Transactions;

 



 

(ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or a Parent Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(b)_ are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions;

 



 

(iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 7.4_, the parties
would not have entered into this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) the Company acknowledges that in no event will the Company be entitled to
both (i) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and (ii) specific
performance of this Agreement to consummate the Merger;

 



      
 

 



 

(v) each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges that in no event will
Parent be entitled to both (i) the payment of the Company Termination Fee and
(ii) specific performance of this Agreement to consummate the Merger;

 



 

(vi) subject to the rights of the Company in respect of specific performance
pursuant to and solely to the extent provided in _Section 8.12(b)_, in the
event that the Closing does not occur for any reason (whether or not this
Agreement is terminated by the Company and the Parent Termination Fee is
payable), the maximum aggregate liability of Parent together with the Parent
Related Parties shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee to the extent payable plus any additional indemnification and
reimbursement obligations owed to the Company pursuant to and in accordance
with _Section 5.9(i)_, and in no event shall the Company or any other Person
seek, or be entitled, to recover any money or other damages in excess of such
amounts (including, in each case, for any willful, intentional or knowing
breach or other action or inaction) arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters or the Guaranties (and the
termination hereof or thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination or for any breach of, or by virtue of any rights
under, any of the foregoing agreement;

 



 

(vii) subject to the rights of Parent and Merger Subsidiary in respect of
specific performance pursuant to and solely to the extent provided in _Section
8.12(a)_ and except in the case of Fraud or breaches or threatened breaches of
the Confidentiality Agreements, in the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the maximum aggregate liability of Company
together with the Company Related Parties shall be limited to an aggregate
amount equal to the applicable Company Termination Fee and/or the Parent
Expenses, in each case to the extent payable, and in no event shall Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or any other Person seek, or be entitled, to recover any
money or other damages in excess of such amounts (including, in each case, for
any willful, intentional or knowing breach or other action or inaction)
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination or for any breach of, or by virtue of
any rights under, any of the foregoing agreement; and

 



 

(viii) for the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Confidentiality Agreements shall not be superseded, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which
the Confidentiality Agreements are terminated in accordance with their
respective terms, and nothing herein shall limit the rights, obligations or
remedies available to the parties under the Confidentiality Agreements in any
respect.

8.2_, _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section 8.7_, _Section 8.9_ and

Section 8.2 _Extension of Time, Waiver, etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto;

any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in

exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or further
exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement. This

THE TRANSACTIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR
THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. This Agreement is not intended,
and shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of employment with any

parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns or to
otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except with respect to
(i) the directors and officers of the Company covered by _Section 5.10_ and
(ii) the Financing Sources will have the right to enforce their rights under

court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

pursuant to _Section 7.1_, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described
in _Section 8.5_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
including the Companys obligation to consummate the Merger.

Company Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_.

 



 

(iii) _Parent Expense Reimbursement_. Parent shall be entitled to
reimbursement of Parent Expenses if and when payable pursuant to _Section
7.4(d)_.

 



 

(iv) _Termination_. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) _Monetary Damages_. Other than in the case of Fraud, in no event shall (A)
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, Guarantors or the Financing Sources or (B) the
former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates (other than
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or Guarantors), members, managers, general or
limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, Guarantors, the Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates
(the foregoing in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the " ** _Parent Related
Parties_** ") have the right to seek or obtain money damages from the Company
or any Company Related Party under this Agreement (whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) other than the right of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary to payment of the Company Termination Fee as set forth in
_Section 7.4(a)_ or Parent Expenses as set forth in _Section 7.4(d)_. The
election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Parent from, in the
alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ and/or the reimbursement of
Parent Expenses pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)_; provided, however, that, other
than in the case of Fraud, in no event shall Parent be permitted to pursue an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief or any other
remedies under this Agreement or available at Law or equity following the
payment of the applicable Company Termination Fee.

 



 

(b) _Remedies of the Company_.

 



 

(i) _Specific Performance (Pre-Closing Covenants)_. Prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and other than as it
relates to the right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger (which are governed by the provisions of _Section
8.12(b)(ii)_), the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Subsidiary in the courts described in _Section
8.5_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

 



 

(ii) _Specific Performance (Closing)_. Prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company shall be entitled to seek
and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable remedies to
enforce Parents and Merger Subsidiarys obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded (and to exercise its third party beneficiary rights
under the Equity Commitment Letters) and to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing)
have been satisfied at the time the Closing would have occurred but for the
failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, and remain satisfied, (B) the
Debt Financing (or, if Alternative Debt Financing is being used in accordance
with _Section 5.9(c)_, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has
been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing
to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then it will take such actions that are required of
it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to
complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In no
event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance
of this Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this _Section 8.12(b)(ii)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to seek any remedy of
specific performance or other equitable remedies against any Debt Financing
Source. The election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the
alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_; provided, however, that in no
event shall

 



      
 

 



 

the Company be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief or any other remedies under this Agreement or available
at Law or equity following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 



 

(iii) _Parent Termination Fee_. The Company shall be entitled to payment of
the Parent Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_.

 



 

(iv) _Termination_. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 7.1_.

 



 

(v) _Monetary Damages_. In no event shall (A) the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates or (B) the former,
current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general
or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (foregoing in
clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the " ** _Company Related Parties_** ") have
the right to seek or obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at
law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) from Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Guarantors or any Parent Related Party other than the right of
the Company to payment of the Parent Termination Fee as set forth in _Section
7.4(b)_ and to enforce its rights under the Guaranties. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and
each Company Related Party hereby waives any claims against the Financing
Sources and any of their respective former, current or future directors,
officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, management
companies, members, stockholders or equity holders (collectively, the " **
_Financing Source Related Parties_** "), and hereby agrees that in no event
shall the Financing Source Related Parties have any liability or obligation to
the Company or any Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 8.12(b)(v)_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights and
obligations of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Financing Sources under the
Debt Commitment Letters. In addition to the rights of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary hereunder, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled, at
Parents and Merger Subsidiarys sole election, to settle any pre-Closing
claims against Parent or Merger Subsidiary relating to Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys obligations under this Agreement by consummating the Closing and
the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of
this _Section 8.12_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that the right
of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this
_Section 8.12_, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
_Section 8.5_, without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such explicit
rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, none of the Company,
Parent or Merger Subsidiary would have entered into this Agreement. Each party
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity to the extent
that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the
terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.12_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (to the
extent that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under
the terms of this _Section 8.12_) shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(d) _Sole Remedy_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies
provided for in this _Section 8.12_ shall be the parties sole and exclusive
remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
other rights, claims and causes of action, known or unknown, foreseen or
unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that such party may have
against the other party, the Parent Related Parties or the Company Related
Parties, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any Law (including
any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
provided that nothing in this _Section 8.12_ shall relieve any party from any
liability for Fraud.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
