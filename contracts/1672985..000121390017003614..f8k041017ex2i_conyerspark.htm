connection with, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Closing. If any
such Option Holder elects to exercise his or her Vested Options in accordance
with the terms of the Option Notice (such Option Holder, an " _Exercising

upon the occurrence of the Closing, and the Company shall issue to such

through (iii) collectively, the " _Exercised Option Shares Consideration_ "),
in each case payable, without interest, to the applicable Exercising Option
Holder in accordance with _Section 2.10_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company will offset against the payment of the Exercised Option Shares Cash
Consideration the aggregate exercise price per share of Company Common Stock

received. Payment pursuant to this _Section 2.7(e)_ shall constitute the sole
consideration payable in respect of the Exercised Option Shares, and no

Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive its PubCo Common Stock until
such Person delivers a duly executed and completed Parent Letter of
Transmittal to the Exchange Agent. Upon delivery of such duly executed Parent
Letter of Transmittal by such Parent Stockholder to the Exchange Agent, such
Parent Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, shares of PubCo Common Stock in respect of
his, her or its shares of Parent Common Stock referenced in such Parent
Letter of Transmittal. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.9_ , each share of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the shares of PubCo Common Stock to which such Parent Stockholder is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

  



  

   

 | -11-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  _No Further Rights_. All shares of PubCo Common Stock paid upon the

dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which had
become payable with respect to PubCo Common Stock issuable to such Parent
Stockholder.

  



  

(e)  _Parent Redeemed Shares_. Any share of Parent Common Stock held by any
Parent Stockholder that exercises redemption rights pursuant to the Offer (a
" _Parent Redeemed Share_ ") shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth in the Offer. The Parent Parties shall
give the Stockholders' Representative prompt notice of the exercise of any
redemption rights pursuant to the Offer.

Option Holders_.

  



  

(a) _Payment Procedures_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall mail or
otherwise deliver, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise
deliver, to (i) each Company Stockholder entitled to receive the Stock
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ , a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto, with such changes as
may be agreed between the Company and Parent prior to the Closing or as may

Transmittal_ "), and (ii) to each Exercising Option Holder entitled to receive
the Exercised Option Shares Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_ , an
Option Exercise Agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ attached
hereto (the " _Option Exercise Agreement_ "), together with any notice
required pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions in _Article VI_ , in the event that at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (A) a Company Stockholder does not
deliver to the Exchange Agent a duly executed and completed Company Letter of
Transmittal, or (B) an Exercising Option Holder does not deliver to the
Company a duly executed and completed Option Exercise Agreement, then, in
each case, such failure shall not alter, limit or delay the Closing;
_provided_ , that such Company Stockholder or Exercising Option Holder, as the
case may be, shall not be entitled to receive its respective Stock
Consideration or Exercised Option Shares Consideration, as applicable, until
such Person delivers a duly executed and completed Company Letter of
Transmittal or Option Exercise Agreement, as applicable, to the Exchange
Agent (in the case of a Company Letter of Transmittal) or the Company
Surviving Subsidiary (in the case of an Option Exercise Agreement). Upon
delivery of such duly executed Company Letter of Transmittal by such Company
Stockholder to the Exchange Agent, such Company Stockholder shall be entitled
to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Stock
Consideration in respect of his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock
referenced in such Company Letter of Transmittal. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.10_ , each share of Company Common
Stock shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Stock Consideration to which
such Company Stockholder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. Upon the
delivery to the Company Surviving Subsidiary of a duly executed Option
Exercise Agreement, payment of the Exercised Option Shares Consideration
(without interest) to such Exercising Option Holder in respect of his, her or
its Exercised Option Shares shall be made by or on behalf of the Company
Surviving Subsidiary.

  



  

(b)  _No Further Rights_. All Stock Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall
be deemed to have been exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the securities represented by such Company Common Stock and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company Surviving Subsidiary of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except
as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

  



  

(c)  _Changes in Parent Stock_. If at any time between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Class B Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number of kind of shares or securities as a
result of a subdivision, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or other
similar change in capitalization, in each case other than in connection with
the Parent Merger, then the definition of Total Share Count and Reference
Price shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ , that
nothing in this _Section 2.10(c)_ shall be construed to permit Parent to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no evidence of book-entry shares representing fractional shares of
PubCo Common Stock shall be issued in exchange for Parent Common Stock,
Company Common Stock or Exercised Option Shares. In lieu of the issuance of
any such fractional share, PubCo shall pay to each former holder of Parent
Common Stock, Company Common Stock or the Exercised Option Shares who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded up to the nearest cent) determined by _multiplying_ (i) the
Reference Price _by_  (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of PubCo Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_.

  



  

   

 | -13-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e)  _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions declared with respect
to PubCo Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, shall be paid to any Company Stockholder that has not delivered a
properly completed, duly executed Company Letter of Transmittal or to any
Exercising Option Holder that has not delivered a properly completed, duly
executed Option Exercise Agreement. After the delivery of such materials, the
Company Stockholder or Exercising Option Holder, as applicable, shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which had become payable with respect to PubCo Common Stock
issuable to such Company Stockholder or Exercising Option Holder.

  



  

(f)  _Company Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Company Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into the right to receive its applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Company
Dissenting Share pursuant to the DGCL. Each holder of Company Dissenting
Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for
such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but
only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to the DGCL). If, after the Effective Time, any Company
Dissenting Share shall lose its status as a Company Dissenting Share, then
any such share shall immediately be converted into the right to receive its
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as if such share never had
been a Company Dissenting Share, and PubCo shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to the holder
thereof, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
this _Section 2.10_ , its applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as if
such share had never been a Company Dissenting Share. The Company shall give
PubCo (a) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (b) the right to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
PubCo, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand with respect to any
Company Dissenting Share. The Company and the Stockholders' Representative
shall (or shall cause their Affiliates to) enforce any contractual waivers
that the Equity Holders have granted regarding appraisal rights that would
apply to the Company Merger.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parties, the Parent Surviving
Subsidiary, the Company Surviving Subsidiary, the Escrow Agent and the
Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable
Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Parties, the Parent
Surviving Subsidiary, the Company Surviving Subsidiary, the Escrow Agent or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Parent
Stockholders or the Equity Holders in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

_Section 2.12(f)_ hereof. Any increase or decrease in the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ shall be referred to as a "

Merger Consideration Adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes
unless otherwise required by any applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, PubCo shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholders' Representative a statement (the " _Preliminary

Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ "), and (iv) the Company
Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing
Company Transaction Expenses_ "), in each case prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and to the extent in accordance with GAAP, the accounting principles,
policies, procedures, practices, applications and methodologies used in
preparing the Financial Statements, along with reasonable supporting detail
to evidence PubCo's calculations, explanations and assumptions for the
calculation of such amounts.

  



  

(c) The Stockholders' Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days
after the date it receives the Preliminary Closing Statement from PubCo to
deliver to PubCo written notice of the Stockholders'
Representative's disagreement with any item contained in the Preliminary
Closing Statement, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). During the
thirty (30) day period following the Stockholders' Representative's receipt
of the Preliminary Closing Statement, PubCo shall (i) permit
the Stockholders' Representative and its accountants to consult with the
Company and PubCo's accountants as reasonable, and (ii) provide to the
Stockholders' Representative and its accountants reasonable access during
normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances to all relevant
books and records and any work papers (including those of PubCo's accountants
subject to the execution of appropriate agreements with PubCo's accountants)
relating to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement. If a Notice
of Disagreement is received by PubCo, then the Preliminary Closing Statement
(as revised in accordance with clause (A) or (B) below) shall become the Final
Closing Statement and become final and binding upon the Parties on the
earlier of the date (A) on which the Stockholders' Representative and
PubCo resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (B) all matters in
dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the
sixty (60) days following PubCo's receipt of a Notice of Disagreement, PubCo
and the Stockholders' Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, and upon such resolution, the Final Closing Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with the agreement of PubCo and
the Stockholders' Representative.

(d) If PubCo and the Stockholders' Representative are unable to resolve the
disputed items set forth in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30)
days following PubCo's receipt of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer

either (x) the dispute resolution group of BDO New York, (y) the accounting
firm so agreed to by PubCo and the Stockholders' Representative, or (z) the

the Stockholders' Representative and a single written response of each of
PubCo and the Stockholders' Representative to each such presentation so
submitted (iii) render a final resolution in writing to PubCo and the
Stockholders' Representative (which final resolution shall be requested by
PubCo and the Stockholders' Representative to be delivered not more than
thirty (30) days following submission of such disputed matters to the

and binding on the Parties with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Company Transaction Expenses,
and (iv) provide a written report to PubCo and the Stockholders'
Representative, if requested by either of them, which sets forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Firm's final determination.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between
PubCo, on the one hand, and the Equity Holders, on the other hand, based upon
the percentage by which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each of PubCo and the Stockholders' Representative bears to the
amount actually contested by such Party; _provided_ , that any amount owed by
the Equity Holders shall be satisfied solely from the Escrow Fund.

doubt, shall reflect the full fair market value of payments under the Tax
Receivables Agreement and on account of the Bonus Repayment Amount, in each
case, in respect of such Exercised Option Shares) issued to the Exercising
Option Holder, reduced by the applicable exercise price relating to such
Exercised Option Shares. The Exercised Option Shares Cash Consideration shall
be reduced by the amount of any required federal, foreign, provincial, state,

exercise of the Vested Option and issuance of Exercised Option Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Exercising Option Holder's

Section 4.6 _Financial Capability_. Parent has delivered to the Company a
true and complete copy of the executed debt commitment letter among Barclays
Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Parent dated as of April 10, 2017 and as
amended, restated, replaced, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in
accordance with the terms herein, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant
to which the financial institutions party thereto (together with any other
Person that becomes a party thereto by joinder or otherwise, the " _Lenders_
") have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, to lend
the amounts set forth therein, for, among other things, the purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
and expenses (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter has not
been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of
this Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in
any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, in each case, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general principles of equity. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
conditions precedent related to the obligations of the Lenders to fund the
full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter, and, other than a fee letter relating to fees
with respect to the Debt Financing (a complete copy of which has been
provided to the Company, with fee amounts and "flex provisions" redacted
(which redacted terms do not adversely affect the availability of or impose
any additional conditions on the availability of the Debt Financing)), there
are no side letters or other contracts or binding arrangements (oral or
written) to which any Parent Party is a party related to the funding at the
Closing of the Debt Financing other than the Debt Commitment Letter. Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, the net proceeds
contemplated from the Debt Financing, together with the amount in the Trust
Account and, as of the date of this Agreement, other Available Cash will, in
the aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of the payment
obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement at the Closing,
including the payment of (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) all
fees and expenses and other payment obligations required to be paid or
satisfied by the Parent Parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing at the Closing,
including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such amount,
the " _Required Financing Amount_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, (A) no
event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both could constitute a breach or
default) on the part of Parent under the Debt Commitment Letter or, to its
knowledge, any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter and (B) assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Article VI,_ Parent does not
have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing or the amount in the Trust
Account and Available Cash in the aggregate constituting the Required
Financing Amount will not be available to Parent at the Closing. Parent has
fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid prior to
the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 4.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in the

Parent Party or any of their respective properties at Law or in equity,

books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries reasonably
requested; _provided_ that (a) such access shall occur in such a manner as
the Company reasonably determines to be appropriate to protect the
confidentiality of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (b)
nothing herein shall require the Company to provide access to, or to disclose
any information to, the Parent Parties or any of their representatives if
such access or disclosure, in the good faith reasonable belief of the Company,
(i) would cause significant competitive harm to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, (ii) would waive any legal privilege or (iii) would be in
violation of applicable laws or regulations of any Governmental Entity
(including the HSR Act and any other applicable Laws). All of such information
provided to the Parent Parties shall be treated as confidential information
pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions
and restrictions of which are by this reference hereby incorporated herein;

disclosing any such information to their potential financing sources (provided

information) after giving prior written notice of such disclosure to
the Stockholders' Representative.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  _Tax Returns_. PubCo shall, at its own expense, prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the
Group Companies for all Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on the
Closing Date that have not yet been filed and are required to be filed after
the Closing Date. PubCo shall cause any amounts shown to be due on such Tax
Returns to be timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity no later
than the date on which such Taxes are due.

  



  

(b) PubCo shall provide the Stockholders' Representative with a copy of each
such income Tax Return for review and comment not later than thirty (30) days
prior to its due date (including extensions). The Stockholders' Representative
shall review and comment on such Tax Returns within ten (10) days of receipt
thereof. If the Stockholders' Representative does not submit comments within
such period, then the Stockholders' Representative will be deemed to have
approved such Tax Returns as prepared by PubCo, and PubCo will file such Tax
Returns promptly. If the Stockholders' Representative delivers comments to
PubCo within such period, the Stockholders' Representative and PubCo shall use
good faith efforts to resolve any dispute in connection with such comments.
In the event PubCo and the Stockholders' Representative are unable to agree
on any such revisions within five (5) days after the Stockholders'
Representative provides its comments, PubCo and the Stockholders'
Representative shall engage BDO New York to resolve the dispute, the costs
of which shall be borne equally by the Equity Holders on the one hand, and
PubCo on the other hand. Upon the final determination of such dispute, PubCo
shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Returns promptly but no later than
five (5) days after such final determination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.9(b)_ , PubCo shall be entitled to file, or cause
to be filed, the applicable Tax Return without having incorporated the
disagreed upon changes to avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. In the
event the independent public accounting firm's resolution of the dispute
necessitates that a Tax Return filed in accordance with the previous sentence
be amended, PubCo shall cause an amended Tax Return to be filed that reflects
such resolution.

  



  

   

 | -53-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) PubCo shall cause the Group Companies to waive the carryback of any net
operating loss generated in any Tax year ending on or before the Closing Date
or any Tax year ending on or after the Closing Date that is attributable, in
whole or in part, to the Transaction Deductions or to the remaining
amortization deductions attributable to the step-up in basis to the Group
Companies' intangible assets that occurred as a result of the acquisition of
Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., on October 29, 2003 as provided in Section
172(b)(3) of the Code (and any analogous provision of state or local Tax Law).

  



  

(d) To the extent that the Company has paid estimated income Taxes for the
Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ ") and the amount of the estimated income Taxes which were
paid prior to the Closing Date exceeds the amount of the income Tax liability
with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Period (taking into account any allowed
Transaction Deductions for such year), PubCo shall prepare or cause to be
prepared IRS Form 4466 (Corporation Application for Quick Refund of
Overpayment of Estimated Tax) with, if applicable, IRS Form 8302 (Electronic
Deposit of Tax Refund of $1 Million or More) and any analogous application
for a state or local refund of a material overpayment of estimated state or
local income Taxes with respect to such Tax year. Any such refund application
shall be treated as an income Tax Return that is subject to analogous review,
comment, dispute resolution and filing procedures to those set forth in
_Section 5.9(b)_. Within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt from the
applicable Governmental Entity of a refund as a result of such a refund
application, PubCo shall pay an amount equal to such refund to the
Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders), net of any
Taxes and other expenses of attributable to such refund, and without
duplication of any amount paid (or to be paid) pursuant to the Tax
Receivables Agreement or already taken into account in the determination of
Net Working Capital or Indebtedness.

  



  

(e)  _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Neither PubCo nor any of its Affiliates
shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax
election of any Group Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without
the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(f)  _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

Parent Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on other terms
acceptable to Parent that would not reasonably be likely to make funding less
likely to occur when required on the Closing Date on or prior to the Closing
Date. Such actions shall include using its commercially reasonable efforts
to: (i) maintain in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letter until
the initial funding of the Debt Financing; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
of the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing applicable to any Parent
Party and within its control that are to be satisfied by such Parent Party;
(iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive documents (" _Debt Financing
Documents_ ") that substantially reflect the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter (including, as necessary and subject to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter, agreeing to any requested changes to the commitments
thereunder in accordance with any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or any related fee letter), in each case which terms shall
not in any material respect expand on the conditions to the funding of the

amount of the proceeds from the Debt Financing available to be funded on the
Closing Date below the Required Financing Amount (taking into account the
Available Cash); and (iv) assisting with the syndication activities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on a reasonably timely basis and
(v) if the conditions contained in _Article VI_ of this Agreement and the

Available Cash and the amount in the Trust Account, to satisfy all of
the payment obligations of the Parent Parties under this Agreement at the
Closing. Each Parent Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter. No Parent Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or
modification to be made to any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter if
such amendment, supplement or modification would (i) (A) change, expand or
impose new conditions precedent to the funding of the proceeds from the Debt
Financing from those set forth therein on the date hereof or (B) change the
timing of the funding of the proceeds of the Debt Financing thereunder, in
each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially
impair, materially delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of
the proceeds of the Debt Financing when required pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the proceeds of the Debt Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions
existing on the date hereof)) below the Required Financing Amount
(taking into account the amount in the Trust Account and the Available Cash)
or (iii) increase pricing or modify any "flex" provisions existing on the
date hereof (collectively, the " _Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments_
"); _provided_ , that notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this
_Section 5.21_ , a Parent Party may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to (1)
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof (including in replacement of a Lender) or reallocate commitments or
assign or re-assign titles and roles to or amend parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter, (2) decrease pricing or (3) implement any "flex"
provisions existing on the date hereof. For purposes of this Agreement,
references to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such document as
permitted or required by this _Section 5.21_ to be amended, modified or
waived, in each case from and after such amendment, modification or waiver.
Each Parent Party acknowledges and agrees that the Debt Financing is not a
condition to the occurrence of the Closing.

  



  

(b) At the reasonable request of the Company, the Parent Parties shall keep
the Company reasonably informed, in all reasonable detail, of the status of
their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Parent Parties shall give the Company prompt written
notice (i) of any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to result in material breach or default) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any other Debt Financing Document of which any Parent
Party becomes aware, (ii) if and when any Parent Party becomes aware that any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter may
not be available to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at the Closing, (iii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect (A) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any other Debt Financing Document, or (B) material
dispute or disagreement between or among the Parent Parties, on the one hand,
and the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any other Debt
Financing Document, on the other hand, that would reasonably be expected to
result in a failure to receive the proceeds of the Debt Financing (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Debt Financing or the Debt Financing Documents),
and (iv) of any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter (other than in
accordance with its terms). The Parent Parties shall provide the Company,
upon reasonable request, with copies of any Debt Financing Documents as well
as any commitment letters or amendments or waivers to any of the foregoing.

(c) In the event that the Parent Parties determine that the Debt Financing

hereof and such amount is necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby at the Closing, the Parent Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange for and obtain as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of any such financing
failure event, alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_
"), including from the same or alternative sources, in an amount not less
than the Required Financing Amount. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section or anything else in this Agreement, in no event shall the
commercially reasonable efforts of the Parent Parties be deemed or construed
to require the Parent Parties to, and the Parent Parties shall not be
required to, (i) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, or (ii) agree to conditionality or
economic terms of the Debt Financing that are less favorable than those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter
(including any flex provisions therein) as of the date hereof. In the event
that Alternative Debt Financing is obtained, the Parent Parties shall promptly
provide the Company with a copy of the new financing commitment that provides
for such Alternative Debt Financing (the " _Alternative Debt Financing
Commitment Letter_ "). If applicable, any reference in this Agreement to "Debt

inaccuracy, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date;
_provided_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations under this
Agreement, which breach would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the twenty (20) day cure period for the Parent Parties to cure a Terminating
Parent Breach set forth in subclause (ii) above shall not apply if such
Terminating Parent Breach is a result of a breach of _Section 7.1_ ;

  



  

(d) by written notice by any Party if the Closing has not occurred on or
prior to August 21, 2017 (the " _Outside Date_ ") for any reason other than
delay and/or nonperformance of the Party seeking such termination, in which
case the non-terminating Party shall be deemed to be in breach of this
Agreement;

  



  

(e) by the Parent Parties within twenty (20) days of receipt by the Parent
Parties of a Supplement delivered pursuant to _Section 5.8_ which discloses

and such failure cannot be cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of such
Supplement by the Parent Parties or, in any event, within two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing;

Section 9.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

Section 9.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 5.10_ , _Section 5.19_ , _Section 9.17_ and _Section 9.18_ , this
Agreement is exclusively for the benefit of the Company, and its respective
successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of the
Parent Parties under this Agreement, and for the benefit of the Parent
Parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect
to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and this Agreement
shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any
remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall have the
right to enforce the rights of the Equity Holders to pursue damages in the
event of a material breach of this Agreement by any of the Parent Parties, in
which event the damages recoverable by the Company for itself and on behalf of
the Equity Holders shall be determined by reference to the total amount that
would have been recoverable by the Equity Holders if all such Equity Holders
brought an action against the Parent Parties and were recognized as intended
third party beneficiaries hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of the Parties acknowledges to each of the Financing
Sources, as a third party beneficiary, their direct rights against it under
the Financing Source Sections, which are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Financing Source, its heirs and its
legal representatives.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Section Headings_. The Article and Section headings contained in
this Agreement are exclusively for the purpose of reference, are not part of
the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc_. Each Party hereby and any Person
asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it
irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be brought only to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal
courts located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby consents
to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this
_Section 9.7_ is pending before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings
with respect to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any
counterclaim, cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court. Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a
third party beneficiary may do so only if he, she or it hereby waives, and
shall not assert as a defense in any Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason, (b) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in such court, (c) such Party's property is exempt or immune from
execution, (d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, or (e) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper.
A final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in this _Section
9.7_ following the expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject
to any stay during appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Laws. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A
THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR
COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING THERETO.
IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD
PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS
A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE
WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT
BE WAIVED.

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in entering into

assurances, written or oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement
(including the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto) or the
Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge that the rights
of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique
and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by
any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Party may
have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that such non-
breaching Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce its rights
and the other Party's obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions
for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security), including any order, injunction or decree sought by such non-
breaching Party to cause the other Party to perform its respective
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement. Each Party further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the
Agreement.

written consent of the lead arranger of the Debt Financing.

forth in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

behalf of the Equity Holders, including, without limitation, fees and
expenses incurred pursuant to the procedures and provisions set forth in
_Section 2.12_ and _Section 5.9_ and legal and consultant fees, expenses and
costs for reviewing, analyzing and defending any claim or process arising
under or pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (collectively,
" _Administrative Costs_ ").

  



  

(b) Amounts drawn from the Administrative Expense Account to pay
Administrative Costs shall be drawn to reflect each Equity Holder's liability
for such Administrative Costs in accordance with its respective Pro Rata
Percentage.

  



  

(c) At such time, and from time to time, that the Stockholders'
Representative determines in its discretion that the Administrative Expense
Amount will not be required for the payment of such fees, expenses or costs,
the Stockholders' Representative shall distribute, to the Equity Holders,
based on such Person's Pro Rata Percentage, their applicable pro rata amounts
from the Administrative Expense Account.

  



  

(d) The Stockholders' Representative, or the Company, if requested by the
Stockholders' Representative, shall report and withhold any Taxes (from

advisable, or which may be required pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or otherwise, in connection with the consummation of the

but not limited to, the exercise of the power to: (i) execute the Ancillary
Agreements on behalf of each Equity Holder; (ii) act for each Equity Holder
with respect to any Merger Consideration Adjustment and the Ancillary
Agreements; (iii) give and receive notices and communications to or from the
Parent Parties and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by such Equity Holders
individually); and (iv) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stockholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the

act on behalf of each Equity Holder with respect to the disposition,

this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements , and the Parent Parties shall be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Stockholders'

absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Stockholders' Representative. Each Equity Holder shall severally (based on

hold harmless the Stockholders' Representative from and against any loss
incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Stockholders' Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder. From and after the
Closing, if the Stockholders' Representative determines that the amounts in
the Administrative Expense Account are insufficient to satisfy current or
future (whether realized or potential) Administrative Costs, it shall
be entitled to withhold on a pro rata basis from amounts otherwise due to the
Equity Holders under this Agreement or under any Ancillary Agreement amounts
as it deems necessary to provide for such Administrative Costs; _provided_
that such amounts shall be deemed to be included in the Administrative
Expense Account.

in respect of which the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedules is not intended to imply that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of
such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy
as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein or

Section 9.17 _Conflict Waiver_. King and Spalding LLP has represented the
Company and the Equity Holders. All Parties recognize the commonality of
interest that exists and will continue to exist until Closing, and the Parties
agree that such commonality of interest should continue to be recognized
after the Closing. Specifically, the Parent Parties agree that (a) it shall
not, and shall not cause the Company or any Affiliate of the Company to, seek
to have King and Spalding LLP disqualified from representing any Equity Holder
or such Equity Holder's Affiliates in connection with any dispute that may
arise between such parties and the Parent Parties or the Company in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(b) in connection with any such dispute, the Equity Holders or the Equity
Holders' Affiliates involved in such dispute (and not the Parent Parties or
any Group Company) will have the right to decide whether or not to waive the
attorney-client privilege that may apply to any communications between the
Company and King and Spalding LLP that occurred prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 9.18 _No Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Ancillary Agreements and subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter under the terms thereof, all claims, obligations,
liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or the negotiation, execution, or performance
of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only
against (and such representations and warranties are those solely of) the
Parties. No Person who is not a Party, including any current, former or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and
any financial advisor or lender to, any Party, or any current, former or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and
any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing or any Financing
Source (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach (other than as set forth in the Ancillary
Agreements and subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter under the terms thereof), and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Laws, each Party hereby waives and releases all
such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Laws (other than as set forth in the Ancillary Agreements and
subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter under the
terms thereof), (a) each Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights,
claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law
or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of
a Party or otherwise impose liability of a Party on any Nonparty Affiliate,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b)
each Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect
to the performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.18_ shall in any way
limit the rights of the Company from and after the Closing Date under the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive debt documents executed in
connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
under this Agreement) to the extent that the Company is party thereto, and
nothing in this _Section 9.18_ shall in any way limit or qualify the
obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter to
each other or in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the Parties hereby agrees (i)
that it will not bring or support an action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof (any of the foregoing, a " _Financing Source Action_ "), in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or,
if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in Federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), (ii) that any Financing Source Action shall be
governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of New York and (iii) to waive, and hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any Financing Source Action.
