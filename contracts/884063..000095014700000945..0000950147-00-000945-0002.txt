                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 13, 2000 (this "AGREEMENT"),
among Bell  Sports  Holdings,  L.L.C.,  a  Delaware  limited  liability  company
("PARENT"),  Andsonica  Acquisition  Corp., a Delaware  corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("SUB"), and Bell Sports Corp, a Delaware corporation
(the "COMPANY") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter  collectively referred to
as the "CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS").

                                  WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have  approved  and  declared  advisable  the merger of Sub and the Company (the
"MERGER"),  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in
accordance  with the  General  Corporation  Law of the  State of  Delaware  (the
"DGCL"),  whereby each issued and  outstanding  share of common stock,  $.01 par
value, of the Company  ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") not owned directly or indirectly
by the Company will be converted  into the right to receive the Per Share Common
Stock  Consideration  (as  hereinafter  defined) and each issued and outstanding
share of Series A Preferred  Stock,  $.01 par value,  of the  Company  ("COMPANY
SERIES A PREFERRED  STOCK",  and together  with the Company  Common  Stock,  the
"COMPANY  STOCK")  not owned  directly  or  indirectly  by the  Company  will be
converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest,  $50.99, plus any
accrued but unpaid dividends to the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) (the
"SERIES A PREFERRED MERGER CONSIDERATION");

     WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined  that the  Merger is in  furtherance  of and  consistent  with  their
respective  long-term  business  strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective stockholders;

     WHEREAS,  in order to induce  Parent and Sub to enter into this  Agreement,
concurrently  herewith certain of the stockholders of the Company and Parent are
entering into a Voting  Agreement  dated as of the date hereof (the  "SECURITIES
AGREEMENT") in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A; and

     WHEREAS,   the   parties   intend   that  the   Merger  be   treated  as  a
recapitalization   for  financial   accounting  purposes  and  certain  existing
shareholders of the Company have agreed to accept an aggregate of  approximately
5.4% of the shares of the Surviving Corporation  immediately after the Effective
Time as partial consideration in the Merger;

     NOW,  THEREFORE,   in  consideration  of  the  premises,   representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

     Section  1.1 THE  MERGER.  Upon the terms  and  subject  to the  conditions
hereof,  and in accordance  with the DGCL, Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the  Effective  Time  (defined  below).  From and after the Effective
Time, the separate corporate  existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving  corporation (the "SURVIVING  CORPORATION")  and shall
<PAGE>
succeed to and assume all the rights and  obligations of Sub in accordance  with
the DGCL.

     Section 1.2  EFFECTIVE  TIME.  The Merger  shall  become  effective  when a
Certificate of Merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER"), executed in accordance with
the relevant  provisions  of the DGCL, is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as the Constituent  Corporations
shall agree upon and  specify in the  Certificate  of Merger.  When used in this
Agreement,  the term "Effective  Time" shall mean the date and time at which the
Certificate  of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware  or such  later  time  set  forth in the  Certificate  of  Merger.  The
Constituent  Corporations  shall cause the  Certificate of Merger to be executed
and filed with the  Secretary  of State of the State of  Delaware on the date of
the Closing.

     Section  1.3  EFFECTS  OF THE  MERGER.  The  Merger  shall  have the effect
provided  in this  Agreement,  the  Certificate  of  Merger  and the  applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

     Section 1.4 CHARTER AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

          (a) At the  Effective  Time,  the  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  as
     amended, of the Company (the "COMPANY  Charter"),  shall be amended to read
     in its  entirety  as set  forth in  EXHIBIT  B  attached  hereto  and is so
     amended,  shall  be the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  of  the  Surviving
     Corporation  until thereafter  changed or amended as provided therein or by
     applicable  law. At the  Effective  Time,  the Bylaws,  as amended,  of the
     Company (the "COMPANY BYLAWS"), shall be amended to read in its entirety as
     set forth in EXHIBIT C  attached  hereto  and is so  amended,  shall be the
     Bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
     provided therein or by the Company Charter.

          (b) The directors of Sub at the Effective  Time of the Merger shall be
     the  directors  of the  Surviving  Corporation,  until the earlier of their
     resignation  or  removal  or until  their  respective  successors  are duly
     elected and  qualified,  as the case may be. The officers of the Company at
     the  Effective  Time of the Merger shall be the  officers of the  Surviving
     Corporation,  until the  earlier of their  resignation  or removal or until
     their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
     be.

     Section 1.5 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES.  At the Effective  Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the holders
of any securities of the Constituent Corporations:

          (a) Each of the 1,000 issued and  outstanding  share of common  stock,
     $.01 par value,  of Sub shall be  converted  into 943.925  validly  issued,
     fully  paid and  nonassessable  shares  of  common  stock of the  Surviving
     Corporation  constituting  approximately 94.4% of the outstanding shares of
     the Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time.

          (b) All shares of capital  stock of the  Company  that are held in the
     treasury of the Company or by any wholly  owned  Subsidiary  of the Company
     shall be  canceled  and no capital  stock of Parent or other  consideration
     shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
          (c)  Each  share  of  Company  Common  Stock  issued  and  outstanding
     immediately  prior to the Effective  Time (other than shares to be canceled
     in  accordance  with  SECTION  1.5(b) or  SECTION  1.5(G)  and  other  than
     Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)):

               (i)  As to  each  Cash  Only  Share,  the  Per  Share  Cash  Only
          Consideration;

               (ii)  As  to  each  Cash-Note  Share,  the  Per  Share  Cash-Note
          Consideration;

               (iii) As to each Rollover Share,  that fraction of a share of the
          Common  Stock  of the  Surviving  Corporation  equal  to the  Rollover
          Exchange  Rate.  The number of shares of Common Stock of the Surviving
          Corporation  which any holder of Rollover  Shares shall be entitled to
          receive  shall be rounded down to the nearest  number of whole shares,
          and  any  fraction  of a  share  of  Common  Stock  of  the  Surviving
          Corporation  otherwise payable to such holder shall be paid in cash in
          an amount equal to the Per Share Common Stock Consideration multiplied
          times that fractional share.

          All such shares of Company Common Stock,  when so converted,  shall no
          longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be canceled and retired
          and each holder of a  certificate  representing  any such shares shall
          cease to have any rights  with  respect  thereto,  except the right to
          receive  the Common  Stock  Merger  Consideration  applicable  to such
          shares,  less any applicable  withholding taxes, upon surrender of the
          Certificate  (as  hereinafter  defined) that formerly  evidenced  such

          (f) As used in this Agreement,  the term "MERGER  CONSIDERATION" shall
     mean,  with respect to a share of Company  Common  Stock,  the Common Stock
     Merger  Consideration  and,  with  respect to a share of  Company  Series A
     Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Merger Consideration.

     contrary,  to the extent that there are any shares of Class C Common  Stock
     outstanding  which are not fully vested  pursuant to the Company's  Class C
     Investment  and  Incentive  Plan (the  "CLASS C PLAN") as of the  Effective
     Time,  such shares shall be cancelled in the Merger without  payment of any
     consideration to the holders thereof.

          (a) A portion of the Common Stock Merger  Consideration per share will

          (b) The Surviving Corporation shall cause Bell Sports, Inc. ("BSI") to
     make a change of control offer (the "POST-MERGER  OFFER") to all holders of
     BSI's 11% Senior  Subordinated  Notes (the "BSI NOTES") in accordance  with
     the terms and conditions of the Indenture dated as of August 17, 1998 among
     the Company,  BSI and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee relating to
     the BSI Notes (the  "INDENTURE"),  which  Post-Merger Offer shall contain a
     consent  solicitation  seeking  amendment  of the  Indenture  to  eliminate
     Section  4.3  and  Sections  4.7  through  4.18  thereof  (the   "INDENTURE
     AMENDMENT").

          (c) Upon consummation of the Post-Merger  Offer, in the event that the
     consent  solicitation:  (i) is approved,  the Surviving  Corporation  shall
     redeem all outstanding  14% Senior  Discount  Debentures due 2009 issued by
     the Company on August 17, 1998 (the "EXISTING  SENIOR DISCOUNT  NOTES") and
     the Merger Notes;  or (ii) is not approved,  the Company shall exchange the
     Existing  Senior  Discount  Notes and the  Merger  Notes for new notes (the
     "EXCHANGE DISCOUNT NOTES").

     Section 1.7 PARENT TO MAKE CASH AVAILABLE.

          (a) DEPOSIT WITH PAYING AGENT.  Parent shall  authorize such Person or
     Persons as shall be reasonably  acceptable to Parent and the Company to act
     as Paying Agent  hereunder  (the "PAYING  AGENT").  Prior to the  Effective
     Time,  Parent  shall  deposit  with the  Paying  Agent  cash in the  amount

                                      -6-
<PAGE>
     necessary for the payment of the cash Merger  Consideration  upon surrender
     of certificates  representing shares of Company Stock as part of the Merger
     pursuant to this  SECTION 1.7 (such cash being  hereinafter  referred to as
     the "EXCHANGE FUND").

          The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange  Fund as directed by Parent
     in  obligations  of, or  guaranteed  by, the United  States of America,  in
     commercial paper obligations rates A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investor
     Services or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates
     of  deposit,   bank  repurchase   agreements  or  bankers'  acceptances  of
     commercial  banks with capital  exceeding  $500 million,  in each case with
     maturities not exceeding five (5) days, or money market funds substantially
     all the assets of which are the above types of investments  (without regard
     to the maturities  thereof).  All earnings on the Exchange Fund shall inure
     to the  benefit  of  Parent.  If for any  reason  (including  losses),  the
     Exchange  Fund is  inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares
     of Company Stock shall be entitled under ARTICLE I of this  Agreement,  the
     Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The
     Exchange  Fund  shall  not be used  for any  purpose  except  as  expressly
     provided in this Agreement.

          (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.  As soon as reasonably  practicable after the
     Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation  shall or shall cause the Paying
     Agent to mail to each  holder of record of a  certificate  or  certificates
     that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented  shares of Company
     Stock  (the  "CERTIFICATES"),  (i) a letter  of  transmittal  (which  shall
     specify that delivery shall be effected,  and risk of loss and title to the
     Certificates  shall pass,  only upon  delivery of the  Certificates  to the
     Paying  Agent  and  shall be in a form and have such  other  provisions  as
     Parent may reasonably  specify,  including a representation  as to good and
     marketable title to the shares  represented by the  Certificates,  free and
     clear of all Liens (as hereinafter  defined)) and (ii) instructions for use
     in effecting the surrender of the  Certificates  in exchange for the Merger
     Consideration.  If  requested  by the Company  prior to the  Closing  Date,
     Parent shall  instruct the Paying Agent to make such letters of transmittal
     available at the location of the Closing,  and shall cause the Paying Agent
     to be  available  at such  location  to  receive,  from  record  holders of
     Certificates  wishing to surrender them, such letters of transmittal  along
     with  the  related  Certificates.  Upon  surrender  of  a  Certificate  for
     cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
     appointed  by  Parent,  together  with  such  letter of  transmittal,  duly
     executed,  and such other  documents as may  reasonably  be required by the
     Paying Agent, the holder of such  Certificate  shall be entitled to receive
     in  exchange  therefor  the Merger  Consideration  into which the shares of
     Company Stock  theretofore  represented by such Certificate shall have been
     converted pursuant to SECTION 1.5, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
     forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
     Company  Stock  that  is not  registered  in the  transfer  records  of the
     Company,  payment  may be made to a Person  other  than the Person in whose
     name the  Certificate so surrendered  is  registered,  if such  Certificate
     shall be properly  endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
     the Person  requesting  such payment  shall pay any transfer or other taxes
     required  by reason of the  payment to a person  other than the  registered
     holder  of  such  Certificate  or  establish  to  the  satisfaction  of the
     Surviving  Corporation  that such tax has been  paid or is not  applicable.

<PAGE>
     Until  surrendered as  contemplated  by this SECTION 1.7, each  Certificate
     (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at
     any time after the  Effective  Time to represent  only the right to receive
     upon such surrender the amount of cash,  without  interest,  plus any other
     Merger  Consideration,  if any,  into  which the  shares of  Company  Stock
     theretofore  represented  by such  Certificate  shall  have been  converted
     pursuant to SECTION  1.5. No  interest  or  dividends  will be paid or will
     accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.

          Section 1.8 WITHHOLDING.  Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled
     to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
     this  Agreement  to any holder of shares of Company  Stock such  amounts as
     Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold  with respect
     to the making of such payment  under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as
     amended (the "CODE"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax
     law.  To the extent  that  amounts  are so withheld by Parent or the Paying
     Agent,  such  withheld  amounts  shall be treated for all  purposes of this
     Agreement  as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company  Stock in
     respect of which such deduction and  withholding  was made by Parent or the
     Paying  Agent and any such amounts  deducted or withheld  shall be promptly
     and timely  paid by Parent or the Paying  Agent to the  appropriate  taxing
     authority.

          Section 1.9 RETURN OF EXCHANGE  FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
     which remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company for 3
     months after the Effective  Time shall be delivered to Parent,  upon demand
     of  Parent,  and any such  former  stockholders  who  have not  theretofore
     complied  with this  Article  I shall  thereafter  look only to Parent  for
     payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor the
     Surviving  Corporation  shall be liable to any  former  holder of shares of
     Company Stock for any Merger  Consideration  which is delivered to a public
     official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar
     law.

          Section 1.10 NO FURTHER  OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY STOCK. The Merger
     Consideration  paid upon the  surrender  for  exchange of  Certificates  in
     accordance  with the terms  hereof  shall be deemed to have been  issued in
     full  satisfaction of all rights  pertaining to the shares of Company Stock
     represented by such Certificates.

          Section 1.11 CLOSING OF COMPANY TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time,
     the stock  transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of
     shares of Company  Stock  shall  thereafter  be made on the  records of the
     Company.  If, after the Effective Time,  Certificates  are presented to the
     Surviving Corporation,  the Paying Agent or Parent, such Certificates shall
     be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

          Section 1.12 LOST  CERTIFICATES.  If any  Certificate  shall have been
     lost,  stolen or  destroyed,  upon the making of an  affidavit  (reasonably
     acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such  Certificate
     to be lost, stolen or destroyed,  the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for
     such lost,  stolen or destroyed  Certificate  the Merger  Consideration  to
     which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article I.

          Section 1.13 FURTHER  ASSURANCES.  If at any time after the  Effective
     Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
     bills of sale,  assignments  or  assurances or any other acts or things are

                                      -8-

     Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and
     to do, in the name and on behalf of  either  Constituent  Corporation,  all
     such  other  acts and things as may be  necessary,  desirable  or proper to
     vest,  perfect or  confirm  the  Surviving  Corporation's  right,  title or
     interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,

Agreement,  (a) "Material  Adverse  Change" or "Material  Adverse Effect" means,
when used with respect to Parent or the Company,  as the case may be, any event,

whether a Material  Adverse Change or Material  Adverse Effect has occurred with
respect to either  referenced  party, any change or effect,  to the extent it is
attributable  to (i) any  change in  general  economic  conditions,  or (ii) the
execution,  public  announcement  or existence of this  Agreement,  shall not be
considered  when  determining  whether a  Material  Adverse  Change or  Material
Adverse  Effect  has  occurred;  and (b)  "Subsidiary"  means  any  corporation,
partnership,  limited liability company,  joint venture or other legal entity of

of the stock or other  equity  interests  the  holders  of which  are  generally

                                      -11-

without  notice or lapse of time,  or both) under,  or give to others a right of
payment  or of  termination,  amendment,  cancellation  or  acceleration  of any

     Section 5.8 REAL ESTATE  TRANSFER AND GAINS TAX.  Either the Company or the
Surviving  Corporation  will pay any state or local Tax which is attributable to
the transfer of the beneficial  ownership of the Company's or its  Subsidiaries'
real property,  if any (collectively,  the "GAINS TAXES"),  and any penalties or
interest  with  respect  to the Gains  Taxes,  payable  in  connection  with the
consummation  of the Merger.  The Company and Parent agree to cooperate with the
other in the filing of any returns with  respect to the Gains  Taxes,  including
supplying in a timely manner a complete list of all real property interests held
by the Company and its  Subsidiaries  and any  information  with respect to such
property that is reasonably  necessary to complete such returns.  The portion of
the  consideration  allocable  to the  real  property  of the  Company  and  its
Subsidiaries shall be determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion.

     Section 5.9  INDEMNIFICATION;  DIRECTORS  AND OFFICERS  INSURANCE.  For six
years from and after the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall,  and shall  cause the
Surviving  Corporation  to,  indemnify  and hold  harmless  all past and present
directors,  officers, employees or agents of the Company and of its Subsidiaries
against any claim,  action or investigation made against them to the full extent
permitted by law, any outstanding  indemnification  agreements listed on SECTION
5.9 of the Company Letter,  the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws,  in each
case for all acts or  omissions  arising from their  service in such  capacities
occurring at or prior to the  Effective  Time,  and shall  periodically  advance
litigation  expenses  incurred by each such person in connection  with defending
any claim,  action or  investigation  against  them  arising out of such acts or
omissions  (including the cost of any investigation and preparation  incurred in
connection  therewith).  Parent  shall  provide,  or shall  cause the  Surviving
Corporation to provide,  for an aggregate period of not less than six years from
the Effective Time, the Company's  current and former  directors and officers an
insurance and  indemnification  "tail" policy that provides  coverage for events
occurring  prior to the  Effective  Time (the "D&O  INSURANCE")  that is no less
favorable than the Company's  existing  policy or, if  substantially  equivalent
insurance  coverage is unavailable,  the best available coverage that is similar
thereto; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay a premium  for the  "tail"  D&O  Insurance  in excess of 150% of the last
annual  premium paid by the Company  prior to the date hereof,  but in such case
shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. In the event Parent
or any of its  successors  or assigns (i)  consolidates  with or merges into any
other person and is not the  continuing  or surviving  corporation  or entity of
such  consolidation  or merger or (ii) conveys all or  substantially  all of its
properties  and assets to any person then,  and in each case,  proper  provision
shall  be  made so  that  the  successors  and  assigns  of  Parent  assume  the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

     The costs for maintaining the D&O Insurance shall be a Company Expense.

     Section  5.10  NOTIFICATION  OF  CERTAIN  MATTERS.  Parent  shall  use  its
commercially  reasonable  efforts to give prompt notice to the Company,  and the
Company shall use its commercially  reasonable  efforts to give prompt notice to
Parent, of: (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence,  of any event the occurrence,
or non-occurrence,  of which it is aware and which would be reasonably likely to
cause (x) any  representation  or warranty  contained  in this  Agreement  to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material  respect or (y) any covenant,  condition or
agreement  contained in this  Agreement  not to be complied with or satisfied in
all material  respects,  (ii) any failure of Parent or the Company,  as the case
may be, to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant,  condition or
agreement  to be complied  with or satisfied by it hereunder or (iii) any change

                                      -39-
<PAGE>
or event which would be reasonably  likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect on
Parent or the Company, as the case may be; provided,  however, that the delivery
of any notice  pursuant to this  Section  5.10 shall not (A) limit or  otherwise
affect the remedies  available  hereunder to the party  receiving such notice or
(B) affect the  representations  or warranties of any party or the conditions to
the obligations of any party hereunder.

     Section 5.11 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

          (a) Parent  shall cause the  Surviving  Corporation  to honor,  to the
     extent  applicable,  all Company  Plans and all  employment,  severance and
     indemnification  agreements to which the Company or its  Subsidiaries  is a
     party as of the Effective Time and set forth on SECTION 3.14 of the Company
     Letter;  PROVIDED,  THAT,  the Bell Sports Corp.  Long Term  Incentive Plan
     shall be excluded from such arrangements.

          (b) Nothing in this  Agreement  shall be  interpreted  as limiting the
     power of the Surviving  Corporation  to amend or terminate any Company Plan
     or any  other  employee  benefit  plan,  program,  agreement  or  policy in
     accordance  with its terms or as requiring  the  Surviving  Corporation  or
     Parent to offer to  continue  (other  than as  required  by its  terms) any
     written employment contract.

          (c)  Parent  agrees  that it  shall,  or  shall  cause  the  Surviving
     Corporation  to,  maintain the Company's Bonus Plan for Fiscal Year 2000 (a
     copy of which is included on SECTION  5.11(c) of the Company  Letter) as in
     effect on the date hereof though the end of the Company's  Fiscal Year 2000
     and to provide,  or cause the  Surviving  Corporation  to  provide,  to the
     participants therein all payments thereunder,  PROVIDED, that to the extent
     that any  action  taken by Parent or the  Surviving  Corporation  after the
     Effective Time, including without limitation, any restructuring and related
     charges,  would  have the  effect of  reducing  the  amount  payable to any
     participant,  such action and the related  effect shall be  disregarded  in
     determining the amount to be paid to such participant.

     Section  5.12  STATE  TAKEOVER   LAWS.  If  any  "fair  price,"   "business
combination" or "control share acquisition"  statute or other similar statute or
regulation  shall become  applicable to the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,
Parent and the Company and their respective  Boards of Directors shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as  practicable on the terms  contemplated  hereby and otherwise act to
minimize  the  effects of any such  statute or  regulation  on the  transactions
contemplated hereby.

     Section 5.13  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.  The Company  shall  furnish to Parent
within (i) twenty  (20) days after the end of each  month,  commencing  with the
month ending May 27, 2000, an unaudited  consolidated  balance sheet and related
statements of operations of the Company and its  Subsidiaries for such month and
for the period of the Company's fiscal year ended at the end of such period,  in
each  instance  compared  to the prior  fiscal  year and the  budget and (ii) an
audited consolidated balance sheet and related statements of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2000
(the "JULY 1 FINANCIALS") on or before July 31, 2000.

     Section 8.3 INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated.  The table of contents, table of defined terms and headings contained
in this  Agreement are for  reference  purposes only and shall not affect in any
way  the  meaning  or  interpretation  of this  Agreement.  Whenever  the  words
"include,"  "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,  they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without  limitation."  The words  describing
the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa,  and words denoting
any gender shall include all genders.  The phrases "the date of this Agreement",
"the date  hereof" and terms of similar  import,  unless the  context  otherwise
requires,  shall  be  deemed  to  refer  to June  13,  2000.  The  parties  have
participated  jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.  In the
event an  ambiguity  or  question  or  intent  of  interpretation  arises,  this
Agreement  shall be  construed  as if  drafted  jointly  by the  parties  and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring  any party by
virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

     Section 8.4  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered  one and the same  agreement,  and shall become
effective when one or more  counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other parties.

     Section 8.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement
(including  the  documents  referred  to herein),  the  Exhibits  and  Schedules
contemplated  hereby and the  Confidentiality  Agreement  constitute  the entire
agreement and supersede all prior  agreements and  understandings,  both written
and oral,  among the parties with  respect to the subject  matter  hereof.  This
Agreement,  except for the  provisions  of SECTION  2.10 and SECTION 5.9, is not
intended to confer upon any Person  other than the parties  hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

     Section  8.6  GOVERNING  LAW.  This  Agreement  shall be  governed  by, and
construed in accordance  with, the laws of the State of Delaware,  regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof.

     Section  8.7  ASSIGNMENT.  Neither  this  Agreement  nor any of the rights,
interests  or  obligations  hereunder  shall be  assigned  by any of the parties
hereto  (whether by operation  of law or  otherwise)  without the prior  written
consent of the other parties; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that Parent and Sub may assign
their  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  to one or more of their
wholly-owned  Subsidiaries,  but such assignment shall not relieve either Parent
or Sub of its obligations  hereunder.  Subject to the preceding  sentence,  this
Agreement  will be binding upon,  inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

     Section 8.8 SEVERABILITY.  If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy,  all other terms,  conditions  and  provisions of this  Agreement  shall
nevertheless  remain in full force and effect so long as the  economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner
materially  adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall
negotiate  in good faith to modify this  Agreement  so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually  acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

     Section 8.9  ENFORCEMENT OF THIS  AGREEMENT.  The parties hereto agree that
irreparable  damage would occur in the event that any of the  provisions of this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific wording or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties  hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches  of this  Agreement  or the  Confidentiality  Agreement  and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions  hereof and thereof,  such remedy being in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity.
