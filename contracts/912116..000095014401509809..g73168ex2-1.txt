                  Section 2.6 The Merger; Effects of the Merger. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (a) the
separate existence of the Company shall cease and the Company shall be merged

Exhibit B, shall be the agreement of limited partnership of the Surviving
Partnership, until further amended in accordance with the TRULPA and (c) the
Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the TRULPA and the TBCA.
The provisions of Sections 2.6 and 2.7 shall constitute a Plan of Merger under
the TRULPA and the TBCA.

                  Section 2.7 Conversion of Capital Stock; Conversion and
Issuance of SUSA Units. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Buyer, SUSA, the Company or any of the
holders of any of the outstanding securities of the Company, SUSA or any of
their respective Affiliates:

                      (i) each share of Company Common Stock issued and
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
         held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by any of the Company's
         wholly owned Subsidiaries, which shares shall be cancelled without any
         payment being made pursuant to this Agreement with respect thereto)
         shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the Share
         Consideration upon surrender of the certificate representing such share
         (each a "Certificate") in the manner provided in Section 2.7(b). As of
         the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
         longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
         cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Certificates shall
         cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
         receive the Share Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.7(a). In the
         event of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock
         dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
         convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
         recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common
         Stock permitted hereunder, occurring (or for which a

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
         record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the
         Effective Time, the Share Consideration shall be proportionately
         adjusted to reflect fully such event;

                      (ii) each SUSA Unit issued and outstanding immediately
         prior to the Effective Time (other than those held by the Buyer of any
         of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries or by an Electing Holder) shall
         be cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the right to
         receive the Unit Consideration, payable to the holder of such SUSA
         Unit; provided, however, that each such holder may, at such holder's
         sole discretion, elect (each an "Election") to (x) continue as a
         limited partner of the Surviving Partnership, in accordance with the
         terms of the SUSA Agreement, as amended as set forth in Exhibit B
         hereto (and also to be annexed to the Information Statement), until
         further amended in accordance with the TRULPA, in which case, such
         holder shall not be entitled to receive the Unit Consideration and
         Section 2.7(a)(iii) shall apply or (y) make an Election with respect to
         some but not all of such holder's SUSA Units (with the effects set
         forth in the foregoing clause (x) with respect to, but only with
         respect to, the SUSA Units covered by such Election), in which case,
         such holder shall be entitled to receive Unit Consideration with
         respect to, but only with respect to, the SUSA Units with respect to
         which an Election has not been made, in accordance with Section
         2.7(a)(iii); provided, further, that any holder of SUSA Units who (x)
         is entitled to receive an amount of Unit Consideration equal to
         $250,000 or less, in the aggregate, (y) is not an "accredited investor"
         (as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act) or
         (z) would not be eligible, in the Buyer's reasonable judgment (after
         being advised by outside counsel), based on the Buyer's (and such
         counsel's) review of such holder's responses to a questionnaire sent to
         the holders of SUSA Units (which questionnaire shall be in form and
         substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and the Company) and such
         other customary matters as are reasonably taken into account by the
         Buyer and its counsel ,to continue as a limited partner of the
         Surviving Partnership in accordance with this Agreement without
         registration of such holder's SUSA Units under the Securities Laws or
         state securities or blue sky laws, shall, in each of cases (x), (y) and
         (z), have no right to make an Election hereunder. Elections shall be
         made in a form designated by the Buyer for that purpose, which form
         shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (an "Election Form"). The
         Election Form shall (x) state that, by making an Election, a holder of
         SUSA Units shall be deemed to (A) have consented to the amendment of
         the SUSA Agreement, as amended as set forth in Exhibit C, and (B) have
         unconditionally and irrevocably waived any and all rights such holder
         may have against the Sellers or the Buyer or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives under the SUSA Agreement
         or, in connection with and with respect to the Purchase, the
         Redemption, the Merger, the repayment of the Credit Lines and the other
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, under the Tax Protection
         Agreements, (y) when completed, specify the number of SUSA Units, if
         less than all, with respect to which an Election is made (failing
         which, the holder thereof shall be deemed to have made an Election with
         respect to all of such holder's SUSA Units), and (z) provide any other
         information or certification relating to Taxes that is reasonably
         required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
         Election Form shall offer each holder of SUSA Units who has made an
         Election , and who is a party to a Tax Protection Agreement obligating
         such holder to indemnify the general partner of SUSA with respect to
         any SUSA Debt, the opportunity to enter into an amendment to such Tax
         Protection Agreement that permits such holder to continue such

                                      -17-
<PAGE>
         indemnity, after the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
         (including repayment of the Credit Lines), with respect to the same
         amount of SUSA Debt to which the indemnity applied before such sale. In
         order to be effective, an Election Form must be duly completed, signed
         and submitted to the Buyer, and must be received by the Buyer by the
         date (the "Election Deadline") specified in the Election Form or in the
         letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.7(b)(i). Any holder of
         SUSA Units who has the right to make, and has made, an Election
         pursuant to this Section 2.7(a)(ii) (each an "Electing Holder") may at
         any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke such Election by written
         notice to the Buyer received by the Buyer prior to the Election
         Deadline. Any Electing Holder who does not submit a properly completed
         Election Form which is received by the Buyer prior to the Election
         Deadline, or who has duly revoked such Election, shall be deemed not to
         have made an Election and shall be entitled to receive the Unit
         Consideration. The Buyer shall, in its sole discretion, determine
         whether an Election Form has been properly completed, signed and
         submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial defects in such form.
         Such decision shall be conclusive and binding. If any Electing Holder
         shall submit a defective Election Form, upon discovery of such defect,
         the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify such
         holder and to permit such holder to (prior to the Election Deadline)
         cure such defect. Any defective Election not cured prior to the
         Election Deadline shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the
         holder of SUSA Units making such purported Election shall be deemed not
         to have made an Election and shall be entitled to receive the Unit
         Consideration;

                      (iii) each general or limited partnership interest of SUSA
         owned by the Buyer or its direct or indirect Subsidiaries immediately
         prior to the Effective Time, and each SUSA Unit issued and outstanding
         immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which the
         holder thereof has the right to make, and has duly made, an Election in
         accordance with Section 2.7(a)(ii), shall remain a general or limited
         partnership interest, as applicable, of the Surviving Partnership and
         no payment shall be made pursuant to this Agreement with respect
         thereto. In addition, Buyer shall contribute cash to SUSA (directly or
         indirectly through depositing the same with the Paying Agent in
         accordance with Section 2.7(b)) in an amount not to exceed $128,197,920
         as needed to pay the Unit Consideration to non-Electing Holders, and
         SUSA Units shall be issued to the Buyer in an amount equal to the sum
         of (i) the number of non-Electing Holders' SUSA Units cancelled
         pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(ii) (which SUSA Units shall be treated as
         having been sold to the Buyer by the non-Electing Holders for federal
         income tax purposes) and (ii) a number of SUSA Units equal to the
         quotient of (x) the Loan Repayment Amount divided by (y) the Unit
         Consideration (the "Additional Buyer Units"); and

                      (iv) each SUSA Unit held in the treasury of SUSA
         immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall remain issued
         and held in treasury after the Merger and no payment shall be made with
         respect thereto, and all such SUSA Units shall thereafter constitute
         limited partnership interests in the Surviving Partnership.

                  (b) (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall designate
         an agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying Agent")
         for the holders of Company Common Stock and SUSA Units (other than any
         Electing Holders) to receive the Merger Consideration to which they
         shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(a), and, at the

                                      -18-
<PAGE>
         Closing, the Company shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust
         with the Paying Agent the Purchase Consideration, and the Buyer shall
         deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent an
         amount in cash as is necessary to pay (after using the Purchase
         Consideration for such purpose) the Merger Consideration to which the
         holders of shares of Company Common Stock and SUSA Units (other than
         Electing Holders), as the case may be, are entitled to receive in
         exchange for their Certificates and SUSA Units, as the case may be,
         pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Promptly after the Effective Time, the
         Surviving Partnership shall cause to be mailed to each person who was,
         at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Certificates or SUSA
         Units, and who, in each case, is entitled to receive the Merger
         Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7(a), a form of letter of
         transmittal (which shall (x) specify that delivery shall be effected,
         and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass only upon
         proper delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent, (y) in the
         case of holders of SUSA Units, include a Form of Election and (z)
         otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as the Buyer
         may reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the
         surrender of any Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal.
         Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (if applicable),
         together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
         executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
         documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
         of such Certificate or a holder of SUSA Units (other than an Electing
         Holder) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Share
         Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced
         by such Certificate or the Unit Consideration for each such SUSA Unit,
         as the case may be, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. Until
         such time, each share of Company Common Stock or SUSA Unit (with
         respect to which an Election has not been made by the holder thereof)
         outstanding after the Effective Time, shall be deemed for all purposes
         to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No
         interest shall accrue or be paid on the Share Consideration or Unit
         Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate (if
         applicable) and a duly completed and validly executed letter of
         transmittal for the benefit of the holder thereof.

                      (ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
         to a person other than the person in whose name any surrendered
         Certificate (if applicable) is registered and/or who is submitting the
         letter of transmittal, it shall be a condition of payment that any
         Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
         in proper form for transfer and otherwise that the person requesting
         such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by
         reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other
         than the registered holder of such Certificate or holder of SUSA Units
         to which the letter of transmittal relates, as the case may be, or
         shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Partnership
         that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

                      (iii) At any time following the third month after the
         Effective Time, the Buyer or the Surviving Partnership, as applicable,
         shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
         funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
         disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock or SUSA Units
         (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent
         in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such
         holders shall be entitled to look to the Buyer (subject

                                      -19-
<PAGE>
         to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general
         creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
         payable upon due surrender of any Certificates (if applicable) held by
         them and a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Buyer, the Surviving
         Partnership, the Company, the Trust and the Paying Agent or any other
         person shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
         or SUSA Units for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such
         shares or SUSA Units, as the case may be, to a public official pursuant
         to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

                      (iv) Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders three
         years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior
         to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
         property of any Government Authority) shall become, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law, the property of Buyer free and clear of
         any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                      (v) After the close of business on the day of the
         Effective Time or the Effective Time, whichever is earlier, there shall
         be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
         Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company or of SUSA Units on
         the records of SUSA for the SUSA Units. From and after the Effective
         Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or SUSA Units
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
         any rights with respect to such shares or SUSA Units, respectively,
         except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law, and, if after
         the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving
         Partnership or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
         and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.7.

                      (vi) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
         destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
         claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
         required by the Surviving Partnership, the posting by such person of a
         bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Partnership may direct
         as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
         to such Certificate the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such
         lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Share Consideration.

                      (vii) Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Partnership
         shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
         otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
         Company Common Stock or SUSA Units, as the case may be, such amounts as
         it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold
         with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other
         applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
         by the Buyer or the Surviving Partnership, as the case may be, such
         withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
         having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or
         SUSA Units, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
         withholding was made by the Buyer or the Surviving Partnership, as the
         case may be.

                  Section 2.8 Options; Restricted Stock.

                  (a) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate,
including obtaining consents from holders of options to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted pursuant to the Company Plans listed on Schedule
2.8 ("Company Options"), to the extent required by the applicable Company Plan
or option award agreement, such that immediately prior to the Closing, all
Company Options shall be fully vested and the Company Options shall terminate
and be cashed out pursuant to the following sentence. At or immediately prior to
the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of each Company Option,
each holder of a Company Option shall be paid by the Company in full
satisfaction of such Company Option a cash payment in an amount in respect
thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Share
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to such
Company Option and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Company Option, less any income or employment tax withholding required under
the Code or any provision of state or local law and less the amount of any
unpaid loan from the Company to the holder of the Company Option to the extent
the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option were pledged
as a security interest for the payment of such loan.

                  (b) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be necessary or
appropriate such that, immediately prior to the Closing, each restricted stock
award granted by the Company shall become immediately and fully payable or
distributable and the restrictions thereon shall lapse and any performance
targets shall be deemed achieved in full.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                Representations and Warranties of the Company

                  Except (i) as disclosed in the Company Reports filed after
January 1, 2001 and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, or
(ii) as set forth on the disclosure schedules (with specific reference to the
particular section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information set
forth in the relevant disclosure schedule relates; provided, however, that an
item included on a disclosure schedule with respect to any section or subsection
of this Article 3 shall be deemed to relate to each other section or subsection
of this Article 3 but only to the extent that such relationship is reasonably
inferable) delivered by the Sellers to the Buyer prior to execution hereof, the
Sellers hereby represent and warrant, jointly and severally, to the Buyer as
follows:

                  Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a)
The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good

validly existing and in good standing, as applicable, under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and has all requisite

                  (e) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
to do business, licensed and in good standing, as applicable, in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification or license, except for any failures to be
so qualified, licensed or in good standing as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) Schedule 3.1(f) sets forth the name of each Subsidiary of
the Sellers (whether owned, directly or indirectly, through one or more
intermediaries). All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other

all of the outstanding capital stock of each of the Purchased Subsidiaries.

                  (g) There are no existing options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights, agreements or commitments
which obligate the Company, the Trust, SUSA or any other Subsidiary of the
Company to issue, transfer or sell or to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any shares of capital stock or equity interests in the Trust or SUSA and, ex-

                                      -22-

other than Permitted Liens. There are no existing options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights, agreements or commitments
which obligate the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to transfer,
sell, decrease or increase the amount of, or otherwise dispose of any
Investment. No event, fact or circumstance exists that has impaired or would
reasonably be expected to impair the value of any Investment, except, in each
case, for events, facts and circumstances that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Investment is listed on Schedule 3.1(h).

                  Section 3.2 Authority Relative to Agreements; Board Approval.
(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance of the
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action (corporate,
trust or partnership, as applicable) on the part of each of the Sellers, subject
only to approval by the Company's shareholders as contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the
Sellers and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of such Seller
enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors' rights or general principles of equity.

                  (b) Each of the Company Board and the Special Committee, at a
meeting duly called and held, by the unanimous vote of all members of the
Special Committee, (i) determined that the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Purchase, the Redemption and the Merger, are advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and approved this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Purchase, the Redemption
and the Merger, (ii) directed that this Agreement, the Purchase and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the shareholders
of the Company for their approval and resolved to recommend that the
shareholders of the Company vote in favor of this Agreement and the approval of
the Purchase, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(iii) if and to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of
causing the parties hereto not to be subject to any state takeover law that
might otherwise apply to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company, in its capacity as the sole general partner of SUSA and Holdings
and otherwise, has taken (and caused its Subsidiaries to take) all action
necessary or appropriate under the SUSA Agreement and Holdings' agreement of
limited partnership or otherwise to authorize the Purchase, the Redemption, the
Merger, the issuance of the Additional Buyer Units and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  Section 3.3 Capital Stock and Units. (a) The authorized
capital stock of the Company as of November 30, 2001 consists of 150,000,000

rights. The Company has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities the holders of which have the
right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on any matter. As of
November 30, 2001, other than (i) for 2,873,760 SUSA Units which may be redeemed
by the holders thereof for Company Common Stock or the cash equivalent thereof
(at the option of the Company) pursuant to the provisions of the SUSA Agreement,
or (ii) 2,160,790 shares of Company Common Stock subject to grant or issuance
under Company Options and pursuant to the Prudential Profit Sharing and 401(k)
Plan, there are no existing options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible
securities, or other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate the
Company to issue, transfer or sell or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company.

                  (b) As of November 30, 2001, 30,261,231 SUSA Units are validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, 27,387,471 of which are

Preferred Units (650,000 of which are issued and outstanding as of November 30,
2001), there is no other form of limited partnership interest in SUSA issued or
outstanding. SUSA has not issued or granted securities convertible into
interests in SUSA, and is not a party to any outstanding commitments of any kind
relating to, or any presently effective agreements or understandings with
respect to, interests in SUSA, whether issued or unissued. The Company is the
sole general partner of SUSA. The Conversion Factor (as defined in the SUSA
Agreement) is 1.0.

                  (c) As of November 30, 2001, all of the limited partnership
interests of Holdings are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and
nonassessable, and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as set forth on Schedule 3.3(c). There is only one class of
Holdings' units of limited partnership, and there is no other form of limited
partnership interest in Holdings issued or outstanding. Holdings has not issued
or granted securities convertible into interests in Holdings, and is not a party
to any outstanding commitments of any kind relating to, or any presently
effective agreements or understandings with respect to, interests in Holdings,
whether issued or unissued. The Company is the sole general partner of Holdings.

                  Section 3.4 No Conflicts; No Defaults; Required Filings and
Consents. Neither the execution and delivery by any of the Sellers hereof nor
the consummation by such Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Purchase, the Redemption and the Merger, will:

                  (a) conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of
         the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the SUSA Agreement or the
         organizational documents of the Trust, Holdings or any other Subsidiary
         of the Company or any of the Partnerships;

                  (b) result in a breach or violation of, a default under, or
         the triggering of any payment or other obligations pursuant to, or
         accelerate vesting under, any Company Plan or any grant or award made
         under any of the foregoing, except as specifically contemplated by this
         Agreement or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
         be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                                      -24-
<PAGE>
                  (c) violate or conflict with any statute, regulation,
         judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect;

                  (d) violate or conflict with or result in a breach of any
         provision of, or constitute a default (or any event which, with notice
         or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) or a change of
         control (or equivalent thereof) under, or result in the termination or
         in a right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the
         performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
         of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
         under, or result in being declared void, voidable or without further
         binding effect, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
         bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust or any license, franchise,
         permit, lease, contract, agreement (including any of the agreements set
         forth on Schedule 3.9(d)) or other instrument, commitment or obligation
         to which the Company or such Subsidiary is a party, or by which the
         Company or such Subsidiary or any of its properties is bound or
         affected (including the SUSA Debt or the SUSA Agreement), except for
         any of the foregoing matters which would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect; or

                  (e) require any consent, approval or authorization of, or
         declaration, filing, notice to or registration with, any Government
         Authority, other than any filings required under the Securities Act,
         the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, state securities or blue sky laws or
         specified on Schedule 3.4 (collectively, the "Regulatory Filings"), and
         any filings required to be made with the Secretary of State of
         Tennessee or any national securities exchange on which the Company
         Common Stock is listed, except as would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect.

                  Section 3.5 SEC and Other Documents; Financial Statements;
Undisclosed Liabilities. (a) Each registration statement, report, proxy
statement or information statement and all exhibits thereto prepared by the
Company or SUSA or relating to their respective properties, since January 1,
1999, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed or
to be filed by the Company or SUSA, as applicable, with the SEC (collectively,
the "Company Reports") is or will be available on the SEC's Electronic Data
Gathering Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) System, to the extent such Company
Report is required to be filed through such system. The Company Reports were or
will be filed with the SEC in a timely manner and constitute or will constitute
all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by the Company or SUSA
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Laws"). As of their respective dates,
the Company Reports (i) complied or will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Laws and (ii) did
not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. There is no unresolved violation asserted by any
Government Authority with respect to any of the Company Reports. No Subsidiary
of the Company, other than SUSA, is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

                  (b) Each of the balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presented or will present the financial position of the entity or
entities to which it relates as of its date and each of the statements of
operations, shareholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) fairly presented or will present the results of operations,
retained earnings or cash flows, as the case may be, of the entity or entities
to which it relates for the periods set forth therein, in each case in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein
and except, in the case of unaudited statements, for normal recurring year-end
adjustments which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The independent accountants who
have audited the financial statements included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company Reports have not delivered to the Company or the Company Board
any "management letters" with respect to such financial statements or related
matters of internal accounting control structures or procedures.

                  (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
Liabilities that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 3.6 Litigation; Compliance With Law. (a) There are no
Actions pending or, to the Sellers' knowledge, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or that would question the
validity hereof or any action taken or to be taken in connection herewith. There
are no continuing orders, injunctions or decrees of any Government Authority to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its
properties or assets are bound (which orders, injunctions or decrees are listed
on Schedule 3.6), except those orders, injunctions or decrees which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, decree or injunction of
any Government Authority or any body having jurisdiction over them or any of
their respective properties which, if enforced, would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
provisions of Chapter 23 (Dissenters' Rights) of Title 48 of the Tennessee Code
Annotated will not apply to the Purchase, the Redemption or the Merger, and no
holders of securities of any of the Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries
(including holders of shares of Company Common Stock or SUSA Units) shall have
any dissenters', appraisal, redemption, buy-out or other similar rights (other
than the right of holders of SUSA Units under the SUSA Agreement to receive the
Unit Consideration) in connection with the Purchase, the Redemption, the Merger,
the issuance of the Additional Buyer Units or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

                  Section 3.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since
September 30, 2001, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has conducted its
business only in the ordinary course and has acquired real estate and entered
into financing arrangements in connection therewith only in the ordinary course
of such business, and there has not been (a) any change, circumstance or event
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a

                                      -26-
<PAGE>
Material Adverse Effect, (b) any commitment, contractual obligation, borrowing,
capital expenditure or transaction entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than any such transaction which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
(c) any change in the Company's or SUSA's accounting principles, practices or
methods which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (d) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company Common
Stock or the SUSA Interest or any other action or event that would have required
the consent of the Buyer pursuant to Section 5.5.

                  Section 3.8 Tax Matters; REIT and Partnership Status. (a) The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed with the appropriate
taxing authority all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it or has
timely requested extensions and any such request has been granted and has not
expired. Each such Tax Return is complete and accurate in all material respects.
All material Taxes owed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been paid
or accrued, except for Taxes being contested in good faith and for which
adequate reserves have been taken. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
properly accrued all material Taxes for such periods subsequent to the periods
covered by such Tax Returns. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
executed or filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority any agreement now
in effect extending the period for assessment or collection of any Tax. None of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any pending action or
proceedings by any taxing authority for assessment or collection of any material
Tax, and no claim for assessment or collection of any material Tax has been
asserted against it. True and complete copies of all federal, state and local
income or franchise Tax Returns filed by the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries for 1998, 1999 and 2000 and all written communications with Taxing
authorities relating thereto have been delivered to the Buyer or made available
to representatives of the Buyer prior to the date hereof. No claim has been made
in writing or, to the Sellers' knowledge, otherwise by an authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There is
no dispute or claim concerning any material Tax liability of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (i) claimed or raised by any taxing authority in writing or
(ii) as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge. No issues
have been raised in writing in any examination by any taxing authority with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, by application of
similar principles, reasonably could be expected to result in a material
deficiency or increase in Tax for any other period not so examined. Schedule
3.8(a) lists all federal and state income Tax Returns filed with respect to the
Company or SUSA for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 1996,
indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited, and indicates those Tax
Returns that currently are the subject of audit. All federal, state, local, and
foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 1996 have been
provided or made available to the Buyer.

                  (b) The Company (i) intends to be taxed as a real estate
investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code ("REIT") through
the close of the tax year in which the Closing occurs and has complied (and will
comply) with all applicable provisions of the Code relating to a REIT, through
the close of the tax year in which the Closing occurs, (ii) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for
2000 and 2001, and (iii) has not taken or omitted to take any action which would
reasonably be

                                      -27-
<PAGE>
expected to result in a challenge to its status as a REIT, and, to the Sellers'
knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened.

                  (c) Any amount or other entitlement that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby by any Employee, officer, or director of
the Company or SUSA or any of their Affiliates who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) under any Company Plan currently in effect would not be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code).

                  (d) The disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of
the Code for employee remuneration will not apply to any amount paid or payable
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Company Plan or other
agreement, program, arrangement or understanding currently in effect.

                  (e) The Company, for its taxable year ended December 31, 1994
was eligible to and did validly elect to be taxed as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes and at all times thereafter continued such election and continued
to be so eligible to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Each
Subsidiary that is treated as an association taxed as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes and that is owned directly or indirectly by the Company is
either a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of
the Code or a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l)(1)
of the Code.

                  (f) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld and
paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and/or paid in connection
with amounts paid or owing to any employee, former employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party.

                  (g) The Company and each other entity transferring an interest
in United States real property in the Purchase hereunder is not a foreign person
within the meaning of Section 1445(b)(2) of the Code.

                  (h) SUSA, each Subsidiary of the Company organized as a
partnership, each Property Joint Venture and each other partnership or other
"flowthrough" entity in which the Company directly or indirectly owns any
interest that files Tax Returns as a partnership for federal income tax purposes
(the "Partnerships") is classified as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, and neither the Partnerships, the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
of the Company has taken a position inconsistent with such treatment with regard
to any Tax. Schedule 3.8(h) sets forth the Company's interest in profits, losses
and cash distributions in each of the Partnerships as of the date hereof (or
such other dates specified on such Schedule). Storage USA Franchise Corp has not
made any contributions that would subject it to allocations under Section 704(c)
of the Code. Other than the Partnerships, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any material interest in any joint venture, partnership, or other
arrangement or contract that could be treated as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes. SUSA has the right to make or to require and, after the
Closing, will continue to have the right to make or to require each Partnership
to make, in the manner provided in Section 1.754-1(b) of the Treasury
Regulations, an election under Section 754 of the Code (and any corresponding
elections under state or

                                      -28-
<PAGE>
local tax law) to adjust the basis of its property as provided in Sections
734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.

                  (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i)
made any election, and is not required, to treat any asset of any Subsidiary as
owned by another person for tax purposes (other than by reason of a Subsidiary
being a "qualified REIT subsidiary" or a "disregarded entity" for federal income
tax purposes and any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law) or
(ii) carried out or been engaged in any transaction or arrangement such that the
law provides that there may be substituted for the amount or value or the actual
consideration given or received (or to be given or received) by any Subsidiary
any different amount or value for Tax purposes (other than immaterial
differences).

                  (j) Other than as a result of the Tax Protection Agreements,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or is subject to
any written ruling of a taxing authority related to Taxes or has entered into
any written and legally binding agreement with a taxing authority relating to
Taxes.

                  (k) Other than the Tax Protection Agreements, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a party to or is otherwise subject to
any Tax allocation or sharing agreement and (ii) has any liability for the Taxes
of another person under law, by contract or otherwise.

                  (l) A true, complete and correct copy of each Tax Protection
Agreement has been delivered to the Buyer, and each such agreement is listed on
Schedule 3.8(l).

                  (m) The Trust is not subject to federal, state or local income
Tax and will not have any such Tax liability as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (n) The repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the
Credit Lines will not result in a breach or violation of, a default under, or
the triggering of any payment or other obligations pursuant to, any Tax
Protection Agreement.

                  Section 3.9 Compliance with Agreements; Material Agreements.
(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or in
violation of any provision of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the SUSA
Agreement or other organizational document of such Subsidiary, except for such
defaults or violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to
be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file with any
Government Authority and all other material reports and statements required to
be filed by them, including any report or statement required to be filed
pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, and have paid
all fees or assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except for such
failures to file or pay which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the Sellers'
knowledge, there is no unresolved violation asserted by any Government Authority
with respect to any such report or statement relating to an examination of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to
the Company

                                      -29-
<PAGE>
or such Subsidiary, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Schedule 3.9(c) sets forth a list of (i) all loan or
credit agreements, notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures and other agreements and
instruments pursuant to which any indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $100,000 is
outstanding or may be incurred (whether unsecured, or secured or collateralized
by mortgages, deeds of trust or other security interests in the Company
Properties or any other assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
otherwise), and the respective principal amounts outstanding thereunder as of
the date hereof (which outstanding indebtedness, (x) if a Credit Line, may be
prepaid by the Company or such Subsidiary at any time without the consent or
approval of, or prior notice to, any other person, and without payment of any
premium or penalty, and (y) if a Mortgage Note, may be prepaid in full by the
Company or such Subsidiary at any time without the consent or approval of any
other person), (ii) each commitment, whether written or oral, entered into by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any guarantees of any third
party's debt or any obligations in respect of letters of credit issued for the
account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) which may result in total
payments or liability in excess of $100,000 and (iii) each bank account (and the
applicable outstanding balance as of September 30, 2001) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with deposits in excess of $100,000. True and complete
copies of the documents relating clauses (i) and (ii) hereof have been delivered
or made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in default, and, to the Sellers' knowledge, no event has
occurred which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default, under any of the documents described in clause (i) or (ii)
of this paragraph or in respect of any payment obligations thereunder except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding guarantees that would cause
SUSA or the Company not to be in compliance with the limitations on incurrence
of indebtedness under the Indenture.

                  (d) All joint venture and partnership agreements to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date hereof, as set
forth on Schedule 3.9(d), are in full force and effect as against the Company or
such Subsidiary and, to the Sellers' knowledge, as against the other parties
thereto, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in default, and,
to the Sellers' knowledge, no event has occurred which, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, with respect to
any obligations thereunder, except as set forth on Schedule 3.9(d) or would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. To the Sellers' knowledge, the other parties to such agreements
are not in breach of any of their respective obligations thereunder, except as
set forth on Schedule 3.9(d) or would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the Sellers'
knowledge, there is no condition with respect to the Company's Subsidiaries
(including with respect to the partnership agreements for the Company's
Subsidiaries that are partnerships) that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) Schedule 3.9(e) sets forth a complete and accurate list of
(i) material agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the date hereof relating to the development or construction of, additions
or expansions to, or management or leasing ser-

                                      -30-
<PAGE>
vices for self-storage facilities or other real properties or (ii) all material
agreements relating to the franchise operations or franchised properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including Storage USA Franchise Corp), in each
case, which are currently in effect and under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries currently has, or expects to incur, any material obligation. True
and complete copies of such agreements have been delivered or made available to
the Buyer prior to the date hereof.

                  (f) Except for (i) agreements made in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice with a maturity of less than one year or
that are terminable on 30 days or less notice, and (ii) agreements the breach or
non-fulfillment of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, Schedule 3.9(f) sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all material agreements entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof which are not listed in
any other Schedule hereto, which list shall also include non-competition or
other similar agreement in favor of a third party, commitment, judgment,
injunction or order to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or subject that has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing the conduct of the business by the Company
and its Subsidiaries before or after the Closing. Each agreement set forth on
Schedule 3.9(f) is in full force and effect as against the Company or such
Subsidiary and, to the Sellers' knowledge, as against the other parties thereto,
no payments, if any, thereunder are delinquent, the Company or such Subsidiary
is not in default thereunder, and no notice of default thereunder has been sent
or received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the same
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. To the Sellers' knowledge, no event has occurred
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any agreement set forth on Schedule
3.9(f), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the Sellers' knowledge, the
other parties to such agreements are not in breach of their respective
obligations thereunder, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. True and complete
copies of each such agreement have been delivered or made available to the Buyer
prior to the date hereof.

                  (g) Schedule 3.9(g) sets forth a complete and accurate list of
all agreements and policies of the Company in effect on the date hereof relating
to transactions with Affiliates and potential conflicts of interest. Each
agreement or policy set forth on Schedule 3.9(g) is in full force and effect,
and the Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Sellers' knowledge, the
other parties thereto are in compliance with such agreements and policies, or
such compliance has been waived by the Company Board or would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. True and complete copies of each such agreement or policy have been
delivered or made available to the Buyer prior to the date hereof.

                  Section 3.10 Financial Records; Organizational Documents;
Corporate Records. (a) The books of account and other financial records of the
Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each of the Partnerships are in all
respects true and complete, have been maintained in accordance with good
business practices, and are and will be accurately reflected in all respects in
the financial statements included in the Company Reports, except, in each case,
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -31-
<PAGE>
                  (b) The Company has previously delivered or made available to
the Buyer true and complete copies of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws,
the SUSA Agreement, and the charter, bylaws, organization documents, partnership
agreements and joint venture agreements of its Subsidiaries, and all amendments
thereto. All such documents are listed on Schedule 3.10(b).

                  (c) The minute books and other records of corporate or
partnership (or equivalent) proceedings of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have been made available to the Buyer, contain accurate records of
all meetings and accurately reflect all other corporate action of the
shareholders and directors and any committees of the Board of Directors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries which are corporations and all actions of the
partners of SUSA and its Subsidiaries which are partnerships, except for
documentation of discussions relating to or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or matters related hereto, and except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  Section 3.11 Properties. (a) Schedule 3.11(a) sets forth as of
the date hereof a complete and accurate list and the addresses of all real
property owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Property Joint Venture or otherwise used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Property Joint Venture in the conduct of their business
(other than Tenancy Leases which are addressed in Section 3.11(l)) or operations
(collectively, and together with the land at each address referenced on Schedule
3.11(a) and all buildings, structures and other improvements and fixtures
located on or under such land and all easements, rights and other appurtenances
to such land, the "Company Properties"). Each of the Company Properties is owned
or leased by SUSA, a Subsidiary of SUSA or a Property Joint Venture, as
indicated on Schedule 3.11(a), and the Company itself does not directly own or
lease any Company Property. To the Sellers' knowledge, SUSA or, in the case of
Company Properties owned by Subsidiaries of SUSA or Property Joint Ventures,
such Subsidiaries or Property Joint Ventures, own good and marketable fee simple
or leasehold title, as applicable, to each of the Company Properties, in each
case free and clear of any Liens, title defects, contractual restrictions or
covenants, laws, ordinances or regulations affecting use or occupancy (including
zoning regulations and building codes) or reservations of interests in title
(collectively, "Property Restrictions"), except for (i) Permitted Liens and (ii)
Property Restrictions imposed or promulgated by law or by any Government
Authority which are customary and typical for similar properties. To the
Sellers' knowledge, none of the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence materially interferes with, impairs, or is
violated by, the existence of any building or other structure or improvement
which constitutes a part of, or the present use, occupancy or operation (or, if
applicable, development) of, the Company Properties taken as a whole, and such
matters do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. American Land Title Association policies of title insurance (or marked
title insurance commitments having the same force and effect as title insurance
policies) have been issued insuring the fee simple or leasehold, as applicable,
title of SUSA, its Subsidiaries or the Property Joint Ventures, as applicable,
with respect to all of the Company Properties in amounts at least equal to the
original cost thereof, and, to the Sellers' knowledge, such policies are valid
and in full force and effect and no claim has been made under any such policy.
The Sellers have delivered or made available to the Buyer true and complete
copies of all such policies and of the most recent surveys of the Company
Properties indicated on Schedule 3.11(a), and true and complete copies of all
material ex-

                                      -32-
<PAGE>
ceptions referenced in such policies and the most recent title reports for and
surveys (to the extent not previously delivered or made available to the Buyer)
of each of the Company Properties available to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be provided or made available by the Sellers for inspection by
the Buyer.

                  (b) Except for matters which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
materially and adversely affect the use or occupancy (or, if applicable,
development) of the Company Properties taken as a whole, the Sellers have no
knowledge (i) that any currently required certificate, permit or license
(including building permits and certificates of occupancy for tenant spaces)
from any Government Authority having jurisdiction over any Company Property, or
any agreement, easement or other right which is necessary to permit the lawful
use, occupancy or operation of the existing buildings, structures or other
improvements which constitute a part of any of the Company Properties or which
are necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of utility service to any
Company Property or of any existing driveways, roads or other means of egress
and ingress to and from any of the Company Properties, has not been obtained or
is not in full force and effect, or of any pending threat of modification or
cancellation of any of same, or (ii) of any violation by any Company Property of
any federal, state or municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation or
requirement, including any applicable zoning law or building code, as a result
of the use or occupancy of such Company Property or otherwise. Except as
communicated to the Buyer in its capacity as claims administrator with respect
to insurance coverage for the Company Properties, the Sellers have no knowledge
of uninsured physical damage to any Company Property in excess of $250,000 in
the aggregate. To the Sellers' knowledge, except for repairs identified in the
Capital Expenditure Budget and Schedule, each Company Property, (i) is in good
operating condition and repair and is structurally sound and free of defects,
with no alterations or repairs being required thereto under applicable law or
insurance company requirements, and (ii) consists of sufficient land, parking
areas, driveways and other improvements and lawful means of access and utility
service and capacity to permit the use thereof in the manner and for the
purposes to which it is presently devoted (or, in the case of the Development
Property, for the development and operation thereon of the applicable Project),
except, in each such case, to the extent that failure to meet such standards
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or to materially and adversely affect the use or
occupancy of the Company Properties taken as a whole (or, in the case of the
Development Property, the development and operation thereon of the applicable
Project). True and complete copies of all engineering reports, inspection
reports, maintenance plans and other documents relating to the condition of any
Company Property prepared for the Company or otherwise in the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' possession have been delivered or made available to the
Buyer prior to the date hereof.

                  (c) The Sellers have no knowledge (i) that any condemnation,
eminent domain or rezoning proceedings are pending or threatened with respect to
any of the Company Properties, (ii) that any road widening or change of grade of
any road adjacent to any Company Property is underway or has been proposed,
(iii) of any proposed change in the assessed valuation of any Company Property
other than customarily scheduled revaluations, (iv) of any special assessment
made or threatened against any Company Property, or (v) that any of the Company
Properties is subject to any so-called "impact fee" or to any agreement with any
Government Authority to pay for sewer extension, oversizing utilities, lighting
or like expenses or charges for

                                      -33-
<PAGE>
work or services by such Government Authority, except, in the case of each of
the foregoing, to the extent that same would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
materially and adversely affect the use or occupancy (or, if applicable,
development) of the Company Properties taken as a whole.

                  (d) To the Sellers' knowledge, each of the Company Properties
is an independent unit which does not rely on any facilities located on any
property not included in such Company Property to fulfill any municipal or
governmental requirement or for the furnishing to such Company Property of any
essential building systems or utilities, other than facilities the benefit of
which inures to the Company Properties pursuant to one or more valid easements.
Each of the Company Properties is served by public water and sanitary systems
and all other utilities, and, to the Sellers' knowledge, each of the Company
Properties has lawful access to public roads, in all cases sufficient for the
current use and occupancy of each Company Property (or, in the case of the
Development Property, for the development and operation thereon of the
applicable Project). To the Sellers' knowledge, all parcels of land included in
each Company Property that purport to be contiguous are contiguous and are not
separated by strips or gores. To the Sellers' knowledge, no portion of any
Company Property lies in any flood plain area (as defined by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers or otherwise) or includes any wetlands or vegetation or species
protected by any applicable laws. To the Sellers' knowledge, no improvements
constituting a part of any Company Property encroach on real property not
constituting a part of such Company Property. No representation set forth in
this subsection (d) shall be deemed to be untrue unless such untruths are,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect or to materially and adversely affect the use or occupancy (or, if
applicable, development) of the Company Properties taken as a whole.

                  (e) The Company Properties comply with the requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), except for such failures to comply
as would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (f) The Company has provided to the Buyer a complete and
accurate rent summary for each Company Property for the year ended December 31,
2000 and for the month ended October 31, 2001 (the "Rent Summary"). The Rent
Summary accurately describes, as of the date thereof, for all Company
Properties, in the aggregate, (i) the total number of rentable square feet of
self-storage units at all Company Properties, (ii) the physical occupancy rate
of the self-storage units at all Company Properties on a rented square foot
basis, (iii) the average term under the leases of self-storage units or other
space at all Company Properties (all such leases for all Company Properties,
collectively, the "Company Leases"), (iv) the delinquency rate of tenants at all
Company Properties, (v) the average rent per rentable square foot at all Company
Properties. True and accurate variance reports for each of the Company
Properties have been delivered or made available to the Buyer prior to the date
hereof.

                  (g) Schedule 3.11(g) sets forth a complete and accurate list
of all binding commitments, letters of intent or similar written agreements made
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
(x) to sell, mortgage, pledge or hypothecate any Company Properties, which,
individually or in the aggregate, are material, or to otherwise enter into a
material transaction in respect of the ownership or financing of any Company
Properties, or (y) to purchase or acquire an option, right of first refusal or
similar right in respect of

                                      -34-
<PAGE>
any real property or properties, which, in any such case, has not yet been
reduced to a written contract. True and complete copies of each such commitment,
letter of intent or other understanding have been delivered or made available to
the Buyer prior to the date hereof.

                  (h) Except as set forth in the Rent Summary, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has granted any outstanding options or has
entered into any outstanding contracts with others for the sale, mortgage,
pledge, hypothecation, assignment, sublease, lease or other transfer of all or
any part of any Company Properties (excluding, however, leases of self-storage
facilities and immaterial commercial and retail leases at the Company
Properties), and no person has any right or option to acquire, or right of first
refusal with respect to, the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' interest in
any Company Properties or any part thereof. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any outstanding options or rights of first refusal or has
entered into any outstanding contracts with others for the purchase of any real
property.

                  (i) Schedule 3.11(i) contains a complete and accurate
description of any non-compliance by any Company Properties, to the Sellers'
knowledge, with any law, ordinance, code, health and safety regulation or
insurance requirement (except for the ADA, which is addressed in this respect in
Section 3.11(e) above), other than such non-compliance as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.11(i) also sets forth the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' or any Property Joint Venture's capital expenditure budget and
schedule for all Company Properties taken as a whole (the "Capital Expenditure
Budget and Schedule"), which describes any material capital expenditures (other
than periodic maintenance and repairs to be made in the ordinary course of
business) which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Property Joint
Venture has budgeted for each Company Property for the period running through
December 31, 2001, and such other material capital expenditures as are
necessary, to the Sellers' knowledge, in order to bring such Company Property
into compliance with applicable laws, ordinances, codes, health and safety
regulations and insurance requirements (including in respect of fire sprinklers,
compliance with the ADA and asbestos containing material) or which the Company
or such Subsidiary otherwise plans or expects to make in order to cure or remedy
any construction, electrical, mechanical or other defects, to renovate,
rehabilitate or modernize such Company Property, or otherwise. To the Sellers'
knowledge, the costs and time schedules for 2001 set forth in the Capital
Expenditure Budget and Schedule are reasonable estimates and projections. There
are no outstanding or, to the Sellers' knowledge, threatened requirements by any
insurance company which has issued an insurance policy covering any Company
Properties, or by any board of fire underwriters or other body exercising
similar functions, requiring any repairs or alterations to be made to any
Company Properties that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. There are no expenditures
expected after December 31, 2001 which would cause any future year's aggregate
capital expenditures for the Company Properties to exceed in any material
respect the amounts set forth for 2001 in the Capital Expenditure Budget and
Schedule for such Company Property.

                  (j) Schedule 3.11(j) contains a list of each Company Property,
other than franchised properties, which consists of or includes undeveloped land
or which is in the process of being developed (collectively, the "Development
Properties") and a brief description of the development intended by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any Property Joint Venture to be carried out or
completed thereon (collectively, the "Projects"), including the total estimated

                                      -35-
<PAGE>
cost of each Project, the stage of completion of each Project and the amount
expended to date on such Project (collectively, the "Development Budget and
Schedule"). To the Sellers' knowledge, there are no material impediments to or
constraints on the development or rehabilitation of any Project within the time
frame and for the cost set forth in the Development Budget and Schedule
applicable thereto, and there have not been any material overruns with respect
to any Project the development of which has commenced.

                  (k) The Sellers have disclosed to the Buyer all adverse
matters known to the Sellers with respect to or in connection with the Company
Properties (including the Company Leases and the Tenancy Leases), which would,
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (l) Schedule 3.11(l) sets forth a complete and accurate list
of all leases pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries occupies
commercial or office space (collectively, the "Tenancy Leases"). Each of the
Tenancy Leases is valid, binding and in full force and effect as against the
Subsidiary and, to the Sellers' knowledge, as against the other party thereto.
None of the Tenancy Leases is subject to any pledge, Lien, sublease, assignment,
license or other agreement granting to any third party any interest therein or
any right to the use or occupancy of any premises leased thereunder, except for
such pledges, Liens, subleases, assignments, licenses or other agreements that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Tenancy Leases
(including all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto) have been
delivered or made available to the Buyer prior to the date hereof. To the
Sellers' knowledge, there is no pending or threatened proceeding which is
reasonably likely to interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the tenant under any
of the Tenancy Leases. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, no payments under
any Tenancy Lease are delinquent and no notice of default thereunder has been
sent or received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There does not exist
under any of the Tenancy Leases any default, and, to the Sellers' knowledge, no
event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
such a default, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (m) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have good and
sufficient title to all the personal properties and assets reflected in their
books and records as being owned by them (including those reflected in the
balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001,
except as since sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business), free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens or as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.


                  Section 3.12 Environmental Matters. (a) To the Sellers'
knowledge, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has obtained, and now
maintains as currently valid and effective, all permits required under
Environmental Laws (the "Environmental Permits") which are material to the
operation of its businesses and properties, taken as a whole, all of which are
listed on Schedule 3.12(a). To the Sellers' knowledge, except as disclosed in
the Company Environmental Reports, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
each Company Property is in

                                      -36-
<PAGE>
compliance with the Environmental Permits and all Environmental Laws, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. To the Seller's knowledge, there are no circumstances
that are reasonably likely to prevent or interfere with such compliance as the
operation of the Company Properties is currently conducted.

                  (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has provided or
made available to the Buyer all material written communications (whether from a
Government Authority, citizens' group, employee or other person) in its
possession or control regarding (x) alleged or suspected noncompliance of any of
the Company Properties with any Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or
(y) alleged or suspected Liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any Environmental Law, except such noncompliance or Liability which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) There are no Liens on any of the Company Properties which
arose pursuant to or in connection with any Environmental Law or Environmental
Claim and, to the Sellers' knowledge, no government actions have been taken or
are in process which are reasonably likely to subject any Company Property to
any such Liens.

                  (d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or as otherwise
disclosed in the Company Environmental Reports, no Environmental Claim with
respect to the operations or the businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or with respect to the Company Properties, has been asserted or,
to the Sellers' knowledge, threatened, and, to the Sellers' knowledge, no
circumstances exist with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the Company Properties that would reasonably be expected to result in any
Environmental Claim being asserted, in any such case, against (i) the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) to the Sellers' knowledge, any person whose
liability for any Environmental Claims the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has assumed pursuant to contract or by operation of law..

                  (e) Except as set forth in the Company Environmental Reports,
(i) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been notified of potential
responsibility in connection with any site that has been placed on, or proposed
to be placed on, the National Priorities List or its state equivalents pursuant
to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., or analogous state laws, (ii) to the
Sellers' knowledge, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries has Released any
Materials of Environmental Concern at any Company Property or any other location
to an extent or in a manner which would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) to the
Sellers' knowledge, no underground storage tanks, surface impoundments, disposal
areas, pits, ponds, lagoons, or open trenches is present at any Company Property
in a manner or condition that is reasonably likely to give rise to an
Environmental Claim which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) to the Sellers' knowledge,
no transformers, capacitors or other equipment containing fluid with more than
50 parts per million polychlorinated biphenyls are present at any Company
Properties in a manner or condition that is reasonably likely to give rise to an
Environmental Claim which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, except for any such
transformers, capacitors or other equipment owned by

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Internal Revenue Service
has issued a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, as the case may
be) with respect to each Company Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, and, to the Sellers'

Sellers' knowledge, no intention to do so has been communicated to Employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (e) There are no pending or, to the Sellers' knowledge,
anticipated claims against or otherwise involving any of the Company Plans or

action or other litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the
ordinary course of Company Plan activities) has been brought against or with
respect to any such Company Plans.

         (f) None of the Company, SUSA or any entity under "common control" with
the Company or SUSA within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA has contributed

Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

         (g) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not maintain or contribute to
any plan or arrangement that provides or has any liability to provide life
insurance, medical or other employee welfare benefits to any Employee upon his
retirement or termination of employment, except as required by the Employee
Arrangements or the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 or
equivalent state law and, to the Sellers' knowledge, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have never represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or
written form) to any Employee that such benefits would be provided.

         (h) For purposes hereof, "Company Plans" means each and all "employee
benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained within the last

arrangements and any other polices or practices of a party hereto providing
employee or executive compensation or benefits to Employees. As used herein, the
term "Employee" refers to any current employee, former employee or retired
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any such employee
on disability, layoff or leave status. "Controlled Group Liability" means any
and all liabilities under (i) Title IV of ERISA, (ii) Section 302 of ERISA,
(iii) Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, and (iv) corresponding or similar
provisions of foreign laws or regulations, other than such liabilities that
arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the Company Plans.

         (i) No Company Plan is or was subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code.

         (j) To the Sellers' knowledge, there does not now exist, nor do any
circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that
would be a liability of the Company following the Closing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the Sellers' knowledge, neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or
Section 4204 of ERISA.

         (k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting or
delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any
Employee of the Company, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not constitute constructive termination or "good reason" under any Com-

                                      -40-

pany Plan (it being understood and agreed, however, that the Company is making
no representation or warranty as to whether consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby constitutes "good reason" under the Employee Arrangements).

         (l) All personnel who manage or operate the Company Properties, or any
of them, are employed directly by SUSA or SUSA-TN LLC, and the Company itself
does not have any Employees. Neither SUSA Management, Inc. nor any of its
current Employees are involved in the management or operation of any Company
Property.

United States or is subject to regulation under non-U.S. laws.

a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor union organization.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, there is no unfair labor practice or labor
arbitration proceeding pending or, to the Sellers' knowledge, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Sellers' knowledge, there are no
organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a collective bargaining
unit presently being made or threatened involving Employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

         Section 3.15 Affiliate Transactions. There are no transactions, series

covering the assets, business, properties and assets, Employees, officers and
directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Insurance Policies"), which are of a type and in amounts reasonable for the

communicated in writing to the Buyer in its capacity as claims administrator
with respect to the Company's insurance coverage, there are no claims in excess
of $50,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pending under any of the Insurance Policies as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such
policies. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Insurance Policy is in

premiums due thereon have been paid in full, (ii) none of the Insurance Policies

takeover laws (the "Other Filings"), and (ii) the Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, prepare and file any filings required of the Buyer or such
Subsidiaries under any such laws (the "Buyer Filings"). The Company and the
Buyer will notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials for amendments or supplements to the SEC Filings or any
Regulatory Filings, Other Filings or Buyer Filings or for additional
information, and will supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between each of them or any of their respective Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other
hand, with respect to any such filings. The SEC Filings and any Regulatory
Filing, Other Filing and Buyer Filing shall comply in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of law. The Buyer shall promptly provide to the
Company all information about the Buyer required to be included or incorporated
by reference in the SEC Filings or any Regulatory Filing or Other Filing and

Filing or Buyer Filing, the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC
or its staff or any other Government Authority, and/or mailing to shareholders
of

                                      -46-

the Company, such amendment or supplement, and each party shall bear all
responsibility and any liability with respect to the information it provides.

         (c) The Buyer, in cooperation with the Company, shall prepare and mail
to the holders of SUSA Units (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), as
soon as practicable after the date hereof (but no later than the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to holders of Company Common Stock), an information statement
(the "Information Statement") containing (i) to the extent relevant,
substantially the same information as the information contained in the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to holders of Company Common Stock, (ii) information
relating to the Unit Consideration, the Election and the other transactions
affecting such holders described in Section 2.7, the terms and conditions of the
Agreement of Limited Partnership set forth on Exhibit B, the consequences of the
Election (including tax consequences thereof), and the proposed business of the
Surviving Partnership, and (iii) a prospective Electing Holder questionnaire to
determine whether such holder is an "accredited investor".

         (d) Subject to Section 5.6, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to take all actions in accordance with applicable law,
the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws to promptly and duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable, (and in any event within
45 days after the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 have been cleared by
the SEC), a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of considering and
voting upon the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Purchase and the Merger. Subject to Section 5.6, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, (i) the Company Board shall recommend and the Special
Committee shall unanimously recommend approval by the shareholders of the
Company of this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby, including the
Purchase and the Merger, and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation,
and (ii) the Company Board and the Special Committee shall not withdraw or
modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the
Buyer, such recommendation. Subject to Section 5.6, the Company shall solicit
from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the transaction
contemplated hereby, including the Purchase and the Merger, and, in connection
therewith, shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to comply with the
applicable requirements of the national securities exchange on which the Company
Common Stock is listed or the TBCA; provided that, after consultation with the
Buyer, the Company may adjourn or postpone such shareholder meeting to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the Company's shareholders or if, as of the time
for which the meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the meeting.

         (e) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consents set forth on Schedule 3.4.

         (f) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the

adjournment or postponement thereof, vote (and cause its Affiliates to vote) all
of the shares of Company Common Stock owned of record or beneficially as of the
date hereof by the Buyer (or such Affiliates) in favor of the approval of such
Superior Transaction, and (b) sell (or cause to be sold) all of the shares of
Company Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by the Buyer (and its
Affiliates), for the same consideration and on terms no less favorable (except
as otherwise contemplated by the Support Agreement) as are offered to the other
holders of the Company Common Stock in such Superior Transaction, except in each
case as otherwise provided in, and subject to, the definition of Superior
Transaction; provided that (i) at the time of termination hereof (in connection
with such Superior Transaction) the Company shall have complied with Sections
5.6(c) (after taking into account the provisions of the last sentence of that
Section) and 7.1(f), and (ii) immediately prior to or upon consummation of such
Superior Transaction, the Buyer shall receive cash consideration for all of its
shares of Company Common Stock as set forth in the definition of Superior
Transaction in Section 5.6(g)(ii). In addition, the Buyer shall, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates that owns shares of Company Common Stock to, execute and
deliver to the other party to a definitive agreement relating to a Superior
Transaction that has been agreed and entered into by the Company at the time
such agreement is entered into, a support agreement in the form attached as
Exhibit C (the "Support Agreement"), upon the written request of such party.

is notified in accordance with Section 5.6(c) or of which the Buyer otherwise
becomes aware or for any other reason or no reason, an offer, proposal or
inquiry with respect to an improvement or modification in favor of the Company
and its shareholders in the terms of the transaction to be effected hereby, or
to enter into any negotiation or discussion relating thereto, or to make what
would be a Superior Proposal with respect to any Superior Transaction entered
into by the Company in connection with or following the termination of this
Agreement (or to make any inquiry with respect thereto, or to enter into any
negotiation or discussion relating thereto). The Company, the Buyer and SUSA
hereby acknowledge and agree that the negotiations leading to, or the entering

and subject to the terms hereof (including the rights afforded to the Sellers
under Sections 5.6(f) and 7.1(f) of this Agreement), and the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not, in any event,
constitute a violation or attempted violation by any of such parties of any

         Section 5.4 Public Announcements. Subject to each party's disclosure
obligations imposed by law and any stock exchange or similar rules, the Company

                           (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in

to a customary confidentiality agreement containing customary standstill
provisions) and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such person and
its Representatives regarding any such Superior Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of any of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.6(a) by any Affiliate or Representative of the Company or any

                  (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
         adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board and the Special Committee may,
during such period, (x) withdraw or publicly propose to withdraw or modify or
publicly propose to modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, if
the Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company's or the Special Committee's outside counsel and
the financial advisor for the Special Committee) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal as to which the Company intends to enter into a
binding written agreement as provided in Section 7.1(f) and (y) adopt, approve

or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position with respect to a tender
offer contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and related Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to its
shareholders or in any other regulatory filing if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board or the Special Committee, based on the advice of outside
counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with their or the
Company's obligations under applicable law.

         (e) Cessation of Ongoing Discussions. During the No-Solicitation
Period, subject to the provisions of the penultimate sentence of Section 5.6(a),
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Affiliates
and Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
commenced on or prior to the No-Solicitation Start Date regarding any proposal
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. From and after the No-Solicitation Start Date, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to have all copies of all nonpublic information
it or its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have distributed since
the date hereof, to persons who have executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such person's consideration of an Acquisition Proposal,
destroyed or returned to the Company as soon as possible.

         (f) Permitted Period. It is understood and agreed that none of the
limitations set forth in this Section 5.6 (other than Section 5.6(c)) with
respect to the solicitation, negotiation or furnishing of information with
respect to Acquisition Proposals shall apply during the period from (and
including) the date of this Agreement to (but excluding) the No-Solicitation
Start Date (the "Permitted Period").

         (g) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

                  "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal, offer or inquiry by
         any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) under the Exchange
         Act) (other than the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any group
         including Buyer or any of its Affiliates) (i) for or with respect to or
         relating to a merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial
         assets, tender offer, recapitalization, share exchange or other
         business combination or similar transaction (or series of transactions)
         involving the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) for
         or with respect to or relating to a transaction pursuant to which the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries issues or would issue, or such
         person or group acquires or would acquire, over 15% of the equity
         securities of the Company or such Subsidiary or (iii) for or with
         respect to or relating to a transaction pursuant to which such person
         or group acquires or would acquire in any manner, directly or
         indirectly, over 15% of the consolidated total assets of the Company,
         in each case, other than the transactions

                                      -54-

         contemplated by this Agreement. Any Superior Proposal shall also be
         deemed an Acquisition Proposal for the purposes hereof.

                  "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written
         proposal made by a third party to effect a Superior Transaction.

                  "Superior Transaction" means the acquisition or cancellation
         of all of the common equity securities of the Company pursuant to or in
         connection with a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation,
         a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or similar
         transaction:

                           (i) on terms which the Special Committee determines
                  in its good faith judgment to be more favorable from a
                  financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock
                  than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (based on
                  the advice of a nationally recognized independent financial
                  advisor), taking into account all the terms and conditions of
                  such transaction (including the financial terms thereof and
                  the likelihood of such a proposal being completed) and this
                  Agreement (including any written proposal by the Buyer to
                  amend the terms of this Agreement);

                           (ii) (w)in which all of the holders of Company
                  Common Stock (except as set forth in clause (z) below) and all
                  of the holders of SUSA Units (other than the Company) would
                  have the right to receive consideration, in the form of cash
                  and/or securities (and which securities will be publicly
                  traded and listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ following
                  consummation of the Superior Transaction), in a per share
                  amount in excess of $42 (with the value of any common stock or
                  security determined at the time the Superior Transaction is
                  entered into, based upon the Trailing Average (as to any such
                  security, if such security is publicly traded and listed on
                  the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ prior to the time the Superior
                  Transaction is entered into) or the Agreed Value (as to any
                  such security, if such security is not publicly traded and
                  listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ prior to the time the
                  Superior Transaction is entered into)), (x) in which SUSA's
                  limited partners (other than the Company) have the right, at
                  their sole discretion, to remain as limited partners of SUSA
                  or a successor limited partnership on terms comparable to
                  those contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise to continue
                  their equity interest and tax deferred status, (y) which does
                  not prohibit the Buyer from being able to propose any
                  amendments to the terms of this Agreement to make them more
                  favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
                  Company Common Stock than the Superior Transaction, and (z) in
                  which the consideration to be received by the Buyer for all of
                  its shares of Company Common Stock is payable, and is paid,
                  prior to or simultaneously with the payment of the
                  consideration to be received by holders of Company Common
                  Stock other than the Buyer, entirely in cash (and, if any
                  Company shareholders are to receive or have the option to
                  receive any securities, in an amount per share equal to the
                  greatest of (A) if only cash consideration is payable on any
                  shares of Company Common Stock, the per share cash
                  consideration payable on such shares, (B) if only securities
                  are payable on any shares of Company Common Stock, an amount

                                      -55-
<PAGE>
                  in cash equal to value of such securities determined at the
                  time the Superior Transaction is entered into (with the value
                  of any such securities determined at the time the Superior
                  Transaction is entered into, based upon the Trailing Average,
                  as to securities that are publicly traded and listed on the
                  NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ prior to the time the Superior
                  Transaction is entered into, or the Agreed Value, as to any
                  such securities which are not publicly traded and listed on
                  the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ prior to the time the Superior
                  Transaction is entered into) and (C) if a combination of cash
                  and securities is payable as consideration for any shares of
                  Company Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to the sum of
                  the values determined in accordance with clause (A), with
                  respect to the cash portion of the per share consideration
                  payable to holders of Company Common Stock, and clause (B),
                  with respect to the securities portion of the per share
                  consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock); and

                           (iii) that is reasonably capable of being completed
                  on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
                  regulatory, legal and other aspects of such transaction,
                  within the same time-period as the Take-Along Period (giving
                  due consideration to the respective dates the Buyer and such
                  person executed definitive agreements with the Company) and
                  with a likelihood of successful consummation not less
                  favorable than those applicable to the transactions
                  contemplated hereby.

                  "Trailing Average", with respect to any publicly traded
         security listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ, means the average Closing
         Price (as defined below) of such security on the fifteen consecutive
         Trading Days (as defined below) immediately preceding the date of
         determination. "Trading Day", with respect to any security, means a day
         on which such security is traded on the national securities exchange or
         quotation system or in the over-the-counter market used to determine
         Closing Prices for such security. "Closing Price" of a security on any
         day means the last reported sale price, regular way, of such security
         on such day, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the
         average of the reported closing per share bid and asked prices, regular
         way, of such security on such day, in each case, on the national
         securities exchange or quotation system or in the over-the-counter
         market on which such security is listed or admitted to trading or
         quoted.

                  "Agreed Value", with respect to any security not publicly
         traded and listed on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ, means an amount equal to
         what the Special Committee's and the Buyer's respective financial
         advisors mutually agree would be the Trailing Average, were such
         securities then publicly listed and traded on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ,
         or, in the event that such financial advisers are unable to reach
         agreement as to such hypothetical Trailing Average within 5 days after
         a written request by the Buyer or the Company, as may be determined by
         the investment banking firm appointed pursuant to Schedule 5.6(g). Any
         mutual determination of the financial advisors or determination by the
         investment banking firm appointed pursuant to this definition shall be
         final and binding on the parties.

         Section 5.7 Information and Access. From the date hereof until the
Closing (a) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to
the Buyer and its Representa-

                                      -56-
<PAGE>
tives full and reasonable access during normal business hours (and at such other
times as the parties may mutually agree) to the properties, books, contracts,
commitments, records and appropriate personnel of the Company and such
Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to the Buyer (i) a
copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Laws or the HSR Act, and (ii) all
other information concerning the businesses, assets or personnel of the Company
and such Subsidiaries or the Company Properties as the Buyer may reasonably
request, and (b) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer
shall have the right to conduct or cause to be conducted, at the Buyer's
expense, an environmental, physical, structural, electrical, mechanical and
other inspection and review of any Company Properties or request that the
Company update, at the Buyer's expense, any existing reports, reviews or
inspections thereof, in which case the Company shall promptly cause its reports,
reviews and inspections to be so updated by the firm or person who prepared such
report or conducted such review or inspection. The Buyer and its Representatives
shall, in the exercise of the rights described in this Section, not unduly
interfere with the operation of the businesses of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or unduly interfere with, restrict or restrain the access of other
persons to the properties, books, contracts, commitments, records and senior
management of the Company and such Subsidiaries during the Permitted Period or
otherwise unduly impair the ability of the Company to receive a Superior
Proposal during the Permitted Period. No information or knowledge obtained in
any investigation pursuant to this Section or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Buyer and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give reasonably prompt notice to
each other of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, known to such
party, which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to result
in (a) a breach of any representation or warranty of such party contained in
this Agreement or (b) the failure of any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by such party under this Agreement. In furtherance of
and without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) inform the Company if the Buyer no longer expects that all of the
funds, to the extent necessary, will be available pursuant to the Buyer
Financing at the Closing, and (ii) reasonably promptly apprise the Company of
circumstances relating to the Buyer Financing upon reasonable request of the
Company from time to time prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or
the conditions to such party's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         Section 5.9 Employee Matters.

         (a) The Buyer agrees to comply with the terms of all employment and
change-in-control agreements set forth (and designated as such) on Schedule
3.13(a). After the date hereof until the Closing, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof nor any officer of the Company shall take any action that
would cause any amount to become due or payable or to be paid under any Employee
Arrangement as a result of the execution hereof, the Purchase, the Redemption or
the Merger or any other matter contemplated hereby.

                                      -57-
<PAGE>
         (b) Nothing in this Agreement (other than Section 5.10), express or
implied, shall create a third-party beneficiary relationship or otherwise confer
any benefit, entitlement, or right upon any person other than the parties
hereto, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever.

         Section 5.10 D&O Insurance; Indemnification. (a) From and after the
Closing, the Surviving Partnership and the Buyer shall, jointly and severally,
to the fullest extent permitted by Tennessee law for a period of six years from
the Closing, indemnify, hold harmless and provide advancement of expenses to,
each present and former director, trustee and officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and each person who becomes prior to the Effective Time a
director, trustee or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), from, against
and with respect to any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts
paid in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged
acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, which acts or omissions
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including any acts or
omissions related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (an
"Indemnifiable Action"), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the maximum extent that the Company would then be obligated
to indemnify, hold harmless and advance expenses under the Company Charter or
the Company Bylaws if the same were then in effect.

         (b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall control the defense of
any Indemnifiable Action with counsel selected by the Buyer, which counsel shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party shall, at such party's expense, be permitted to participate in
such defense with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there
is any conflict of interest between the Buyer and any Indemnified Party or there
are additional material defenses available to any Indemnified Party, such
Indemnified Party shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such
Indemnifiable Action with counsel selected by such Indemnified Party, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as accrued and in advance of the
final disposition of such Indemnifiable Action to the fullest extent permitted
by Tennessee law; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 5.10(b), the Buyer shall not be obligated to pay fees and
expenses of more than one such counsel (plus local counsel) for all Indemnified
Parties in any single Indemnifiable Action.

         (c) For a period of six years after the Closing, the Buyer shall, or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to maintain (to the extent available in the
market) in effect a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering
those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has
been delivered or made available to the Buyer prior to the date of this
Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable to such
persons as the Company's existing coverage with respect to acts or failures to
act occurring prior to the Effective Time.

         (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer and the Surviving
Partnership will, jointly and severally, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company

                                      -58-
<PAGE>
pursuant to the indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors
and officers in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and set forth on
Schedule 5.10(d).

         (e) If Buyer or the Surviving Partnership or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving person of the consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Buyer or the Surviving Partnership shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

         (f) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs and representatives.

         Section 5.11 REIT Status. From and after the date hereof until the
Closing, the Company will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations
of the Code relating to a REIT, and will not take any action or fail to take any
action which would reasonably be expected to, alone or in conjunction with any
other factors, result in the loss of its status as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes. For purposes of determining whether a dividend, other than a Permitted
Dividend, is required to be paid in order to comply with this covenant, the
parties agree that both the distribution of the Share Consideration in the
Merger and the Buyer Amount paid to the Buyer in redemption of its Company
Common Stock, to the extent that such transactions are scheduled to occur during
the applicable tax year, shall be treated as a distribution qualifying for a
dividends paid deduction under Sections 561 and 562 of the Code to the extent
provided therein.

         Section 5.12 Shareholder Litigation. Until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Closing Date,
the Company shall afford the Buyer the opportunity to participate, at the
Buyer's expense and with separate counsel, in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company or the Company Board relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, it being understood
that the Company shall be entitled to settle any such litigation, but only with
the Buyer's prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

         Section 5.13 Purchase Price Allocation. The Purchase Price, the
Transferred Liabilities and any other capitalized item (including SUSA
liabilities treated as additional purchase price under Section 752) shall be
allocated among the SUSA Interest and the Other Assets in a manner consistent
with a schedule to be provided by the Buyer to the Company at or prior to the
Closing (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). The Buyer and the Company shall each
file Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060) on a timely
basis reporting the allocation of the Purchase Price consistent with such
Purchase Price Allocation. Except as may be required by law, the Buyer and the
Company will (i) file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, as adjusted as a result of a
substantial increase or decrease in the Purchase Price, if any, and (ii) may not
take any action inconsistent therewith.

         Section 5.14 Sale of Shares by the Buyer. The Buyer agrees that, until
the later of (i) termination hereof or (ii) the expiration of the Take-Along
Period, it shall not sell, transfer,

                                      -59-
<PAGE>
pledge or otherwise dispose of any shares of Company Common Stock (and it shall
cause its Affiliates not to take any of the foregoing actions) other than to its
(or their) Affiliates or in accordance with Section 5.2 of this Agreement. Each
Affiliate of the Buyer that owns shares of Company Common Stock shall, and the
Buyer shall cause any such Affiliate to, agree to be bound by the provisions of
this Section 5.14.

                                   ARTICLE 6

                             Conditions to Closings

         Section 6.1 Conditions to Obligations of the Buyer. The obligations of
the Buyer to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject
to satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following
conditions precedent, any of which may be waived in writing exclusively by the
Buyer:

         (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of the Sellers contained herein shall have been true and correct in all respects
on and as of the date hereof, and shall be true and correct in all respects on
and as of the Closing Date, with the same effect as though such representations
and warranties had been made on and as of the Closing Date (except, in any such
case, for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date or
time, which need only be true and correct in all respects as of such date or
time), other than, in all such cases, for such failures to be true and/or
correct as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect (without regard, for purposes of this
Section 6.1(a), to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications
contained in such representations and warranties). The Sellers shall have
delivered to the Buyer at the Closing certificates of appropriate officers dated
the Closing Date to such effect.

         (b) Covenants. The covenants and agreements of the Sellers to be
performed on or before the Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement (other
than Section 5.8) shall have been duly performed in all material respects
(without regard, for purposes of this Section 6.1(b), to any materiality
qualifications contained in such covenants or agreements). The Sellers shall
have delivered to the Buyer at the Closing certificates of appropriate officers
dated the Closing Date to such effect.

         (c) No Material Adverse Change. No condition to lending or funding,
under or in connection with the Buyer Financing, based upon or related to a
material disruption of, or material adverse change in, financial, banking or
capital market conditions shall have been invoked and be continuing after any
applicable cooling off or similar period, in each case, with the effect that all
or part of the Buyer Financing shall not be available to the Buyer.

         (d) HSR Act. Any waiting period applicable to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated, and no action shall have been instituted by the United States
Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission challenging
or seeking to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which action shall not have been withdrawn or terminated.

                                      -60-
<PAGE>
         (e) Governmental Approvals. Other than the filing of the Merger
Certificate, all authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or
declarations or filings with, or expirations of waiting periods imposed by, any
Governmental Authority (other than under the HSR Act) in connection with the
Purchase, the Redemption, the Merger or the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the failure of which to file,
obtain or occur would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect, shall have been filed, been obtained or
occurred.

         (f) Shareholder Approval. The Purchase, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been approved by the requisite vote
of the Company's shareholders under applicable law, the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws at a duly called meeting of such shareholders at which a quorum
was present.

         (g) No Injunction. There shall not be in effect any order, decree or
injunction of any Government Authority of competent jurisdiction which enjoins
or prohibits consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
there shall be no pending Actions brought by any Government Authority (including
a stop order or similar SEC proceeding with respect to the Proxy Statement)
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (h) Tax Matters. The Company shall not have terminated its election to
be taxed as a REIT, and shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations, including the Code, necessary to permit it to be taxed as a
REIT. The Company shall not have taken any action or have failed to take any

other factors, result in the loss of its status as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes.

the Additional Buyer Units and to admit the Buyer as the general partner and a
limited partner, as applicable, of SUSA and Holdings, as set forth on Schedule

and the Company (including in its capacity as the sole general partner of SUSA
and Holdings) shall have taken (and caused its Subsidiaries to take) all action
necessary or appropriate to authorize the Purchase, the Redemption, the Merger,
the issuance of the Additional Buyer Units and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

         (j) SUSA Management Purchase Agreement. The transactions contemplated

the Sellers to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject
to satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following
conditions precedent, any of which may be waived in writing exclusively by the
Company:

         (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of the Buyer contained herein shall have been true and correct in all respects
on and as of the date hereof, and shall be true and correct in all respects on
and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though such representations
and warranties had been made on and as of the Closing Date (except, in any such
case, for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date or
time, which need only be true and correct in all respects as of such date or
time), other than, in all such cases, for such failures to be true and/or
correct as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Buyer's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (without regard, for purposes of this Section
6.2(a), to any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications contained
in such representations and warranties). The Buyer shall have delivered to the
Sellers at the Closing a certificate of appropriate officers dated the Closing
Date to such effect.

         (b) Covenants. The covenants and agreements of the Buyer to be
performed on or before the Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement (other
than Section 5.8) shall have been duly performed in all material respects
(without regard, for purposes of this Section 6.2(b), to any materiality
qualifications contained in such covenants or agreements). The Buyer shall have
delivered to the Sellers at the Closing a certificate of appropriate officers
dated the Closing Date to such effect.

         (c) HSR Act. Any waiting period applicable to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated, and no action shall have been instituted by the United States
Department of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission challenging
or seeking to enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which action shall not have been withdrawn or terminated.

         (d) Governmental Approvals. Other than the filing of the Merger
Certificate, all authorizations, consents, orders or approvals of, or
declarations or filings with, or expirations of waiting periods imposed by, any
Governmental Authority (other than under the HSR Act) in connection with the
Purchase, the Redemption, the Merger or the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the failure of which to file,
obtain or occur would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, shall have been filed, been obtained or
occurred.

         (e) Shareholder Approval. The Purchase, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been approved by the requisite vote
of the Company's shareholders under applicable law, the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws at a duly called meeting of such shareholders at which a quorum
was present.

made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii).

(with respect to Sections 7.1(b) through 7.1(h), by written notice by the
terminating party to the other party) as follows:

         (a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Company; or

         (b) by either the Buyer or the Company, if the Purchase, the Redemption
and the Merger shall not have been consummated by June 5, 2002 (the "Outside

         (c) by either the Buyer or the Company, if a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or
ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having the
effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Purchase, the Redemption or the Merger (provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party
whose material failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement, including
Section 5.1, has been the principal cause of or resulted in such order, decree
ruling or action); or

         (d) by either the Buyer or the Company, if, at the meeting of Company
shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof permitted by
this Agreement) at which a vote on the Purchase, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is taken, the requisite vote of such
shareholders in favor of such transactions shall not have been obtained; or

         (e) by the Buyer, if, after the Permitted Period (i) the Company Board
and the Special Committee shall have publicly withdrawn or modified in a manner
adverse to the Buyer their recommendation of the Purchase or the Merger or (ii)
the Company Board and the Special Committee fail to reconfirm their
recommendation of the Purchase or the Merger within five Business Days after the
Buyer so requests in writing (which five Business Day period will be extended

and the Special Committee are in good faith seeking to obtain additional
information regarding their decision to reconfirm their recommendation of the
Purchase or the Merger, as applicable); or

         (f) by the Company, if, prior to the meeting of the Company
shareholders at which a vote on the Purchase, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is to be taken, the Company Board and the
Special Committee have entered into a Superior Transaction; provided that:

<PAGE>
                  (i) the Company shall have complied with Section 5.6 in all
         material respects; and

                  (ii) the Company shall, concurrently with such termination,
         pay the Buyer the termination fee required by Section 7.3(b); or

         (g) by the Buyer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Sellers
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause
the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not
have been cured within 30 days following receipt by the Company of written
notice of such breach from the Buyer; or

         (h) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2 not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have
been cured within 30 days following receipt by the Buyer of written notice of
such breach from the Company.

         Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall immediately become
void and have no effect, all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall
cease and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Buyer,
the Sellers or their respective officers, directors, shareholders or Affiliates;
provided that (i) any such termination shall not relieve any party hereto from
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement and (ii) the provisions of
Sections 5.2 and 5.4, this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8 of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement.

         Section 7.3 Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in this Section
7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
and expenses, whether or not the Purchase, the Redemption, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby are consummated; provided, however, that
the Company and the Buyer shall share equally (i) the filing fee of the Buyer's
pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act and (ii) all fees and expenses,
other than accountants' and attorneys' fees, incurred with respect to the
printing, filing and mailing (as applicable) of the Proxy Statement, the
Information Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, including any related preliminary
materials and any amendments or supplements thereto. All fees and expenses
payable pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day
funds.

         (b) The Company shall pay the Buyer (in full satisfaction of the
Company's obligations hereunder) a termination fee of $22.5 million if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or 7.1(f).

         (c) Any fee due under Section 7.3(b) shall be paid by the Company, (i)
in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e), within one Business

pursuant to Section 7.1(f), concurrently with (x) such termination, and (y) if
requested in accordance with Section 5.2 prior to such termination, the
execution of the Support Agreement in accordance with such Section 5.2.

         (d) The Sellers acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Buyer would not enter into
this Agreement. If the Company fails to promptly pay to the Buyer any fee due
under this Section 7.3, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together
with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee at the publicly announced prime
rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. plus four percent per annum, compounded
quarterly, from the date such fee was required to be paid.

         Section 8.5 Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void,
except that the Buyer may substitute one or more of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries for itself without consent of the other parties hereto, provided
that the Buyer shall remain jointly and severally liable for all of its
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sen-

                                      -66-
<PAGE>
tence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

         Section 8.6 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be modified
or amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought;
provided that, after approval of the shareholders of the Company has been
obtained as contemplated hereby, no amendment hereto shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such shareholders without such further approval.
Any party hereto may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by any
other party with any term or provision hereof on the part of such other party
hereto to be performed or complied with. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute
a waiver of such rights, and any waiver pursuant to this Section 8.6 by any
party hereto of a breach of any term or provision hereof shall not be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

         Section 8.7 Interpretation; Absence of Presumption. (a) For the
purposes hereof, (i) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural
and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to include the other gender
as the context requires, (ii) the terms "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and
Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule references shall be deemed to
the Articles, Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified, (iii) the word "including" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall mean "including, without limitation,"
unless otherwise specified, (iv) Section, Article and other headings contained
in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement, and (v) provisions shall
apply, when appropriate, to successive events and transactions.

         (b) This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption
or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting or
causing any instrument to be drafted.

         Section 8.8 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes
closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event
such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the
parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a valid and enforceable term or provision that shall achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term.

                                      -67-

         Section 8.9 Further Assurances. The parties hereto agree that, from
time to time, whether before, at or after the Closing Date, each of them will
execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take
such other action as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

         Section 8.10 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which the parties are entitled at law or in equity.

         Section 8.11 Submission to Jurisdiction. Any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought exclusively in any federal or state court located in the State of
Maryland, and each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served
on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction
of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 8.4 as to giving notice
hereunder shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

         Section 8.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

         Section 8.13 Counterparts and Signature. This Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all
of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties
need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
by facsimile transmission.

         Section 8.14 Post-Closing Tax Matters. The Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause any dividends paid by the Company
during the Company's tax-

                                      -68-
<PAGE>
able year ending with the Effective Time to be designated as "capital gain
dividends" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(3) of the Code to the extent
permitted under applicable law. The Buyer and SUSA will not take any action
following the Closing that is inconsistent with the Company's status as a REIT
for any period prior to the Closing.

                                      -69-
<PAGE>
         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed by or on behalf of
each of the parties hereto as of the day first above written.
