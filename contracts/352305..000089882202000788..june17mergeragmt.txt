          (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each share of

Time (other than shares held in the treasury of Dreyer's, and not including the

to Section 2.5(b) and canceled at the Effective Time pursuant to Section

holder thereof and pursuant to the terms of the Dreyer's Option Plans, vest and
become fully exercisable upon approval and adoption of the Merger by the Board

an option (a "CONVERTED DREYER'S OPTION") to acquire (i) prior to the Redemption

Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Dreyer's Common Stock subject to
such Dreyer's Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, at the price or
prices per share in effect pursuant to the terms of such Dreyer's Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) at and after the Redemption
Date or the effective time of the Short-Form Merger (as defined in the
Governance Agreement), consideration of the same type and amount the holder

Option prior to the Redemption Date and received consideration pursuant to the
Redemption (as defined in the Governance Agreement) at the price or prices per
share in effect pursuant to the terms of such Dreyer's Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Each Converted Dreyer's Option shall otherwise be subject
to the same terms and conditions applicable to the original Dreyer's Option

acceleration by reason of any of the


                                      -11-
<PAGE>


transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.11(e), Dreyer's Options held by individuals who,
pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof, have entered into or enter into employment
agreements in the forms set forth in Exhibit F hereto shall be subject to the
terms of such agreements. Prior to the Effective Time, Dreyer's and Nestle shall
use their reasonable best efforts to effectuate this Section 2.11(e).

          Section 2.12. EXCHANGE OF SHARES IN THE MERGER. (a) At the Effective
Time, New Dreyer's shall make available to an exchange agent selected by New
Dreyer's (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of those Persons who
immediately prior to the Effective Time were the holders of shares of Dreyer's
Common Stock (other than the Nestle Shares), a sufficient number of certificates
representing shares of Class A Common Stock required to effect the delivery of
the aggregate Dreyer's Merger Consideration required to be issued pursuant to
Section 2.11(a) (the certificates representing shares of Class A Common Stock
comprising such aggregate Dreyer's Merger Consideration being hereinafter
referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND").

          (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each holder of record (other than Nestle or its Affiliates) of a certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Dreyer's Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES") (i) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for exchange therefor or for
effecting the exchange of Certificates for shares of Class A Common Stock to be
held in book entry form. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall also mail to each holder of record of shares of Dreyer's Common Stock held
in book entry form ("BOOK ENTRY SHARES") instructions for use in effecting the
exchange of said Book Entry Shares for shares of Class A Common Stock. Upon
surrender of Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and any other required documents, or, in the case of
Book Entry Shares, compliance with the instructions for the exchange thereof,
the holder of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive for the Common Shares represented by such Certificates the Dreyer's
Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered or Book Entry Shares
so exchanged shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, Certificates,
and until exchanged as contemplated by this Section 2.12(b), Book Entry Shares,
shall represent solely the right to receive the Dreyer's Merger Consideration.
No dividends or other distributions that are declared after the Effective Time
on shares of Class A Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof
after the Effective Time will be paid to Persons entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive shares of Class A Common Stock until such Persons surrender
their Certificates or comply with the procedures for exchanging Book Entry
Shares. After such surrender or compliance, as the case may be, there shall be
paid to the Person in whose name the shares of Class A Common Stock are issued
any dividends or other distributions on such shares of Class A Common Stock
which shall have a record date after the Effective Time and prior to such
surrender and a payment date after such surrender, such payment shall be made on
such payment date. In no event shall the Persons entitled to receive such
dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest on such
dividends or other distributions. If any Certificate representing shares of
Class A Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person


                                      -12-
<PAGE>


requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such shares of
Class A Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent shall
not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the
shares of Class A Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except
that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or
distributed with respect to such shares of Class A Common Stock for the account
of the Persons entitled thereto.

          (c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains unclaimed by the
former holders of Dreyer's Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to New Dreyer's, upon demand of New Dreyer's, and any former
holders of Dreyer's Common Stock shall thereafter look only to New Dreyer's for
payment of their claim for the Dreyer's Merger Consideration for the shares of
Dreyer's Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or unexchanged
Book Entry Shares representing shares of Dreyer's Common Stock outstanding prior
to the Effective Time are presented to New Dreyer's, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, none of the Exchange Agent, New Dreyer's or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a holder of shares of Dreyer's Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

          (e) Either New Dreyer's or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Dreyer's Common Stock such amounts as New
Dreyer's (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by New Dreyer's or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the shares of Dreyer's Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding were made by New Dreyer's.

          (f) TAX-FREE TREATMENT. The Parties intend that the Merger will meet
the requirements of Section 368(a) of the Code and rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, that the Merger, the Exchange and the Contribution,
taken together, will meet the requirements described in Section 351 of the Code
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement
shall constitute the plan of reorganization.

                                  ARTICLE III

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NESTLE

          Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Dreyer's
by Nestle on the date hereof (the "NESTLE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), Nestle hereby
represents and warrants to Dreyer's and Merger Sub as follows:

          Section 3.1. INCORPORATION; AUTHORIZATION; ETC. (a) Nestle is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware and each NICC Entity is duly organized and validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the Nestle Disclosure
Schedule, each of the NICC Entities (i) has the requisite corporate or similar
power and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and (ii) is in good standing and is duly
qualified to transact business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
property owned or leased by it or the conduct of its business requires it to be
so qualified, except where the failure to be so organized or in good standing or
to be duly qualified to transact business, or to have such power and authority,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities. For purposes of this
Article III, a "material adverse effect on the NICC Entities" shall mean a
material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects of the NICC Entities, taken as a
whole.

          (b) Nestle has the requisite corporate or similar power to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by
Nestle of this Agreement, the performance by Nestle of its obligations hereunder
and the consummation by Nestle of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Nestle and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Nestle, its Board of Directors or
stockholders are necessary therefor.

          (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Nestle Disclosure
Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not (i)
violate any provision of Nestle's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, (ii)
violate any provision of, or be an event that is (or with the passage of time
will result in) a violation of, or result in the acceleration of or entitle any
party to accelerate or exercise (whether after the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both) any obligation or right under, or result in the imposition of any
Lien upon or the creation of a security interest in any shares of capital stock
or similar interest of any NICC Entity, or any of NICC Entity's assets or
properties pursuant to, any Lien, agreement, instrument, order, arbitration
award, judgment or decree to which Nestle or any NICC Entity is a party or by
which any of them is bound, or (iii) violate or conflict with any other
restriction of any kind or character to which Nestle, any Continuing Affiliate
or any NICC Entity is subject, that, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the NICC Entities or prevent the Transactions from
occurring prior to the Termination Date or result in any material delay in the
consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Nestle, and, assuming the due execution hereof by Dreyer's, New
Dreyer's and Merger Sub, this Agreement


                                      -14-
<PAGE>


constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Nestle, enforceable
against Nestle in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, moratorium or
other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally
and to the effect of the application of general principles of equity (regardless
of whether considered in proceedings at law or in equity). Nestle has delivered
to Dreyer's a true and correct copy of the certificate of formation and the
operating agreement, each as amended to date, of NICC.

          Section 3.2. CAPITALIZATION; STRUCTURE. (a) Nestle owns indirectly
100% of the outstanding capital stock of Contributing Sub and Contributing Sub
owns 100% of the authorized equity interests of NICC. The membership interests
are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and free of preemptive rights
and free and clear of all Liens. The Nestle Shares constitute 9,563,016 shares
of December Common Stock.

          (b) Section 3.2(b) of the Nestle Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
name of each Subsidiary of NICC, its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, the number of outstanding shares of its capital stock or other
equity interests of each class and the name and number of shares owned by each
holder of any such shares of capital stock or other equity interests. Except as
set forth in Section 3.2 of the Nestle Disclosure Schedule, all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the
Subsidiaries of NICC have been validly issued, and are fully paid and
non-assessable, are free of preemptive rights, and are owned directly by NICC as
set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Nestle Disclosure Schedule, free and clear of
all Liens.

          (c) There are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights of any

otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment,
storage, disposal, transport or handling of Air Pollutants, Hazardous
Substances, Oils, Pollutants or Contaminants (the "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS"), except
failures to have obtained such permits, licenses and other authorizations as

          (b) The Business as presently conducted is in compliance with all
terms and conditions of the permits, licenses and authorizations required by the

Environmental Laws, except for such noncompliance which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the NICC Entities. There is no civil, criminal or administrative
action, suit, demand, notice of violation, investigation known to Nestle or
NICC, proceeding, notice or demand letter pending relating to the property or
business of any NICC Entity or, to the knowledge of Nestle and NICC, threatened
against the business or property of


                                      -19-
<PAGE>


any NICC Entity under Environmental Laws that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on

beneath, the property of any NICC Entity, including, to the knowledge of Nestle
and NICC, properties formerly owned by any NICC Entity for which any NICC Entity
has retained any material actual or potential liability or responsibility.

          (d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities,
no cleanup has occurred or is occurring at any property currently owned or
operated by any NICC Entity, which would result or reasonably be expected to
result in the assertion or creation of a material Lien on such property by any
Governmental Authority with respect thereto, nor has any such assertion of a
material Lien been made by any Governmental Authority with respect thereto.

          (e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities,
none of the NICC Entities has received any notice from any Governmental

          (b) Each Nestle Employee Plan and Nestle Benefit Arrangement has been
maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA

individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the NICC Entities.

          (c) Each Nestle International Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations (including any special
provisions relating to registration or qualification where such Nestle
International Plan was intended so to be registered or qualified) and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities, except where
the failure to be in compliance or to maintain good standing would not,

Plan that is intended to be funded and/or book-reserved is fully funded and/or
book-reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

          (d) Each Nestle Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under

materially change the funded status of any such Title IV Plan since the close of
such plan year; and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
any such Title IV Plan and, to Nestle's knowledge, no condition exists that

                                      -21-
<PAGE>


          (f) None of the NICC Entities nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any material Withdrawal Liability that has not been

Affiliates were to experience a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from such plan,

insolvent, or may reasonably be expected to be in reorganization, to be
insolvent, or to be terminated.

          (g) Section 3.19(g) of the Nestle's Disclosure Schedule sets forth:
(i) each Nestle Employee Arrangement under which the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event such as termination of
employment) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or
increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer
or director of any NICC Entity.

          (h) There are no pending or, to NICC's knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), investigations,
lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted against the
Nestle Employee Arrangements, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to such Nestle Employee Arrangements or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of such Nestle Employee Arrangements which would reasonably be
expected to result in any liability of any NICC Entity to the PBGC, the
Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, or any other U.S. or
foreign Governmental Authority, or to any of such Nestle Employee Arrangements,
any participant in any such Nestle Employee Arrangement, or any other party,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities.

          Section 3.20. ACQUISITION OF SHARES FOR INVESTMENT. Nestle has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its acquisition of the Additional Nestle
Shares, and has been provided access to personnel and books of Dreyer's and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of making its evaluation. Nestle is acquiring the
Additional Nestle Shares for investment and not with a view toward any
distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing such shares.
Nestle agrees that the Additional Nestle Shares, if any, may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption
from such registration available under the Securities Act.

          Section 3.21. TAXES. (a) Each of the NICC Entities has duly filed all
Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,
complete and accurate in all material respects. Each of the NICC Entities has
paid all Taxes required to be paid by it. The unpaid Taxes of the NICC Entities
do not exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and tax income) set
forth on the Business Financial Statements, as adjusted for results of
operations and cash flows through the date hereof. There are no pending or, to
the knowledge of NICC,


                                      -22-
<PAGE>


threatened audits, examinations, investigations, deficiencies, claims or other
proceedings in respect of Taxes relating to any of the NICC Entities, except for
those that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities. There are no Liens for
Taxes on any asset of any of the NICC Entities except for Taxes not yet due and
payable, Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, and Liens for Taxes that individually or in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities.
The assets of NICC do not include (A) any entity, contract or agreement that is
classified as a corporation or partnership for federal income tax purposes or
(B) any entity that is treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax
purposed within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3. None of
the NICC Entities has been a member of any group that has filed a combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return other than with one or more corporations
which are members of the affiliated group of corporations of which Nestle is the
common parent and as would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities. None of the
NICC Entities has liability for Taxes of any person under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of U.S. state or local or foreign
law) or other law or by contract or otherwise, except as a result of the
application of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (and any comparable
provision of U.S. state or local or foreign law) to corporations which are
members of the affiliated group of corporations of which Nestle is the common
parent and as would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the NICC Entities. None of the NICC
Entities has made any election, or is required, to treat any of the assets owned
by such NICC Entity as owned by another person for tax purposes. None of the
NICC Entities has received or been subject to any written ruling of any Tax
Authority related to Taxes or entered into any written and legally binding
agreement with any Tax Authority relating to Taxes (and none of the assets owned
by any NICC Entity is subject to or has been the topic of any such agreement).
None of the NICC Entities is a party to or otherwise subject to any Tax
allocation or sharing agreement. Since December 26, 2001, NICC has been
organized as a limited liability company that is indirectly wholly owned by
Nestle, and since such time has been disregarded as an entity separate from its
owner pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii). None of
NICC, any of the NICC Entities or any other transferor of an interest in United
States real property (within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code)
hereunder is a foreign Person within the meaning of Section 1445(b)(2) of the
Code.

          (b) None of Nestle, NICC or their respective Subsidiaries has taken
any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably likely to prevent (i) the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code or (ii) the Merger, Exchange and the Contribution, taken
together, from qualifying as a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code.

jurisdiction of its organization. Except as set forth in Section 4.1(a) of the
Dreyer's Schedule, each of Dreyer's and each of its Subsidiaries (i) has the
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and (ii) is in
good standing and is duly qualified to transact business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of property owned or leased by it or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so
organized or in good standing or to be duly qualified to transact business, or
to have such power and authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's.
For purposes of this Article IV, a "material adverse effect on Dreyer's" shall
mean a material adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects of Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

          (b) Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Merger Sub have the requisite corporate
power to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform their obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery by Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Merger Sub of this Agreement, the
performance by Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Merger Sub of their obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Disinterested Directors of Dreyer's and the Boards of Directors of New Dreyer's
and Merger Sub and, except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and except for obtaining the
approval by the stockholders of Dreyer's of the Merger by the Required Dreyer's
Vote and by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Dreyer's, New Dreyer's or Merger Sub, their respective Boards of
Directors or stockholders are necessary therefor.

          (c) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the Dreyer's Disclosure
Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not (i)
violate any provision of Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries' respective
certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents
or instruments), (ii) except as set forth in Section 4.1(c) of the Dreyer's
Disclosure Schedule, violate any provision of, or be an event that is (or with
the passage of time will result in) a violation of, or result in the
acceleration of or entitle any party to accelerate or exercise (whether after
the giving of notice or lapse of time or both) any obligation or right under, or
result in the imposition of any Lien upon or the creation of a security interest
in any shares of capital stock of Dreyer's or its Subsidiaries or any of
Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries' assets or properties pursuant to, any Lien,
agreement, instrument, order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which
Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any


                                      -24-

of them is bound, or (iii) violate or conflict with any other restriction of any
kind or character to which Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, that,
in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) would, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's or
prevent the Transactions from occurring prior to the Termination Date or result
in any material delay in the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Merger Sub,
and, assuming the due execution hereof by Nestle, this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally and to the effect of the application
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in proceedings
at law or in equity). Dreyer's has delivered to Nestle true and correct copies
of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as amended to date, of
Dreyer's.

date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

          (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each

and except for liabilities which are reflected or reserved against in the

                                      -26-
<PAGE>


Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations that would be
required to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Dreyer's and its
Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, except
for liabilities or obligations arising in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since March 31, 2002, which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Dreyer's.

          Section 4.5. ANTITAKEOVER STATUTE AND PROVISIONS. Dreyer's has taken

the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, from (i)

statute or similar statute or regulation is applicable to or purports to be
applicable to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.

          Section 4.6. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except as set forth in the
Dreyer's SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since December 31, 2001,
there has been no (a) change or development in or effect on the business or
businesses of Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries that has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on Dreyer's, or (b) action taken by
Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof which, if taken
from the date hereof through the Closing, would violate any of clauses
(i)-(xxii) of Section 5.4(b).

          Section 4.7. LITIGATION; ORDERS. Except as set forth in the Dreyer's
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or in Section 4.7 of the Dreyer's
Disclosure Schedule, there are no lawsuits, actions, administrative or
arbitration or other proceedings or governmental investigations pending or, to
Dreyer's knowledge, threatened against Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries that
would, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on Dreyer's. There are no judgments or outstanding
orders, injunctions, decrees, stipulations or awards (whether rendered by a
court or administrative agency, or by arbitration) against Dreyer's or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or businesses that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a

Disclosure Schedule, Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries own exclusively the Dreyer's
Intellectual Property Rights free and clear of all Liens and restrictions. No
material Dreyer's Intellectual Property Right is subject to any outstanding
judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement restricting the use thereof by
Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries or restricting the licensing thereof by
Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person. No use of the Dreyer's
Intellectual Property Rights by Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries is
infringing on any other Person's Intellectual Property Rights and, to the
knowledge of Dreyer's and each of its Subsidiaries, no Person is infringing on
any Dreyer's


                                      -27-
<PAGE>


Intellectual Property Rights, except, in either case, as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Dreyer's Entities. Neither Dreyer's nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a defendant in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding relating to, or
otherwise was notified in writing of, any alleged claim of infringement of any
Intellectual Property Right, and Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries have no

the date of this Agreement, all Licenses possessed by or granted to Dreyer's or
any of its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect except for those whose
failure to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Dreyer's. No proceeding is pending or, to Dreyer's knowledge, threatened seeking
the revocation or limitation of any such License which revocation or limitation
would, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on Dreyer's.

          (b) Section 4.9(b) of the Dreyer's Disclosure Schedule contains a list
of all registrations, filings, applications, notices, consents, approvals,
orders, qualifications and waivers required to be made, filed, given or obtained
by Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries with, to or from any Persons or
Governmental Authorities in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, except for those with respect to which the failure to make, file,

threatened with any work stoppage, labor dispute, arbitration, lawsuit or
administrative proceeding relating to labor matters involving the employees of
Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding workers' compensation claims)
that would, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's.

          Section 4.11. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except as set forth in Section
4.11 of the Dreyer's Disclosure Schedule and the Dreyer's SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof, the conduct of the businesses of Dreyer's and its
Subsidiaries complies with all Laws applicable thereto, except for those
violations of Law which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's; it being
understood that nothing set forth in this Section 4.11 is intended to address
any compliance issue


                                      -28-

forth in the Dreyer's SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth
on Section 4.13 of the Dreyer's Disclosure Schedule (such exceptions, the
"DREYER'S MATERIAL CONTRACTS"), neither Dreyer's nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or bound by any (a) "material contract" (as such term is defined in
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (b) contract or agreement not
terminable upon one year's (or less) notice that materially limits or purports
to materially limit the ability of any of Dreyer's or any of its Affiliates to
compete in any material line of business or in any material geographic area, (c)
agreement with a distributor which is not terminable on one year's (or less)
notice, (d) material joint venture or similar contract or agreement, or (e)
contract which is terminable by the other party or parties thereto upon a change
of control of Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries other than such contracts the
termination of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's. With
respect to all Dreyer's Material Contracts, (i) neither Dreyer's nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to Dreyer's knowledge, any other party to any such Dreyer's
Material Contract is in breach thereof or default thereunder, and (ii) there
does not exist under any provision thereof, any event that, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default,
except for such breaches, defaults and events which in the case of clauses (i)
and (ii) would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's.

          Section 4.14. BROKERS, FINDERS, ETC. Except for the services of the
Dreyer's Financial Advisors, neither Dreyer's nor any of its Subsidiaries has
employed, or is subject to any valid claim of, any broker, finder, consultant or
other intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement who might be entitled to a fee or commission in connection with such
transactions.

          Section 4.15. OPINIONS OF DREYER'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Board of
Directors of Dreyer's has received the opinion of the Dreyer's Financial
Advisor, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that the exchange of
the Dreyer's Common Stock for Class A Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Dreyer's Common Stock (other than
Nestle and its Affiliates).

          Section 4.16. BOARD APPROVAL; RIGHTS PLAN. (a) The Board of Directors
of Dreyer's, by a unanimous vote of all those present at a meeting duly called
and held at which all directors other than Messrs. Robert Helman and M. Steven

stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and (iii) determined to recommend to


                                      -29-

the stockholders of Dreyer's that such stockholders approve the Merger and adopt
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

          (b) The Board of Directors of Dreyer's has taken the requisite action
such that neither Nestle nor any of its Affiliates shall become an "Acquiring
Person," and no "Share Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" (as such terms

approval, execution or delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

          Section 4.17. REQUIRED VOTE. The affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes of the outstanding shares of Dreyer's Common Stock at a stockholders'
meeting is the only vote of the holders of any class of capital stock of
Dreyer's necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the

Subsidiaries has obtained all permits, Licenses and other authorizations which
are required with respect to the operation of Dreyer's and each of its
Subsidiaries as presently conducted under Environmental Laws, except failures to
have obtained such permits, licenses and other authorizations as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Dreyer's.

          (b) The business of Dreyer's and each of its Subsidiaries as presently
conducted is in compliance with all terms and conditions of the permits,
licenses and authorizations required by the Environmental Laws, and is now and

no civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, demand, notice of violation,
investigation known to Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries, proceeding, notice
or demand letter pending relating to the property or business of Dreyer's or any
of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries,
threatened against the business or property of Dreyer's or any of its
Subsidiaries under Environmental Laws, that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Dreyer's.

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's, to the
knowledge of Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries, neither Dreyer's nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any other Person has buried, released, dumped or disposed of
any Hazardous Substances, Oils, Pollutants or Contaminants in quantities

Subsidiaries, including, to the knowledge of Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries,
properties formerly owned by Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries for which
Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries has retained any material actual or
potential liability or responsibility.

          (d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's, no cleanup
has occurred or is


                                      -30-

Subsidiaries which would result or reasonably be expected to result in the
assertion or creation of a material Lien on such property by any Governmental
Authority with respect thereto, nor has any such assertion of a material Lien
been made by any Governmental Authority with respect thereto.

          (e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's, neither
Dreyer's nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice from any
Governmental Authority or private or public entity or individual requesting
information pursuant to Environmental Laws in connection with or advising it
that it is in non-compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, or responsible
for, or potentially responsible for, costs with respect to a release, a
threatened release or cleanup of Air Pollutants, Hazardous Substances, Oils,
Pollutants, or Contaminants generated, used, stored, treated, disposed of or
transported by Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries, and neither Dreyer's nor any
of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement regarding the investigation
or cleanup of any Hazardous Substances, Oils, Pollutants or Contaminants or
responsibility or liability related thereto.

          (f) Notwithstanding any other representation and warranty in this
Article III, the representations and warranties contained in this Section 4.18
constitute the sole representations and warranties of Dreyer's and its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Environmental Law, environmental permit or any
Air Pollutants, Hazardous Substances, Oils, Pollutants or Contaminants.

be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's: (i) there does not
exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Code Section 412
or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) no reportable event within
the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement
has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; (iii) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in full;
(iv) no material liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV
of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any of the NICC Entities; (v)
the actuarial present value of the accumulated plan benefits under such Title IV
Plan (whether or not vested) as of the close of its most recent plan year did
not exceed the fair market value of the assets allocable thereto, and, to
Dreyer's knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would materially
change the funded status of any such Title IV Plan since the close of such plan
year; and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such
Title IV Plan and, to Dreyer's knowledge, no condition exists that presents a
risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds
under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a
trustee to administer, any such Title IV Plan.

          (f) None of Dreyer's, its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material Withdrawal Liability that has not
been satisfied in full. With respect to each Dreyer's Employee Plan that is a
Multiemployer Plan and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Dreyer's:
(i) if any of Dreyer's, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates were to experience a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from such plan,
no material Withdrawal Liability would be incurred; and (ii) none of Dreyer's,
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has received any
notification, nor does any of them have knowledge, that any such Dreyer's
Employee Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization, has been
terminated, is insolvent or may reasonably be expected to be in reorganization,
to be insolvent or to be terminated.

          (g) Section 4.19 of the Dreyer's Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
Dreyer's Employee Arrangement under which the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event such as termination of
employment) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or
increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer
or director of Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (h) There are no pending or, to Dreyer's knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), investigations,
lawsuits or arbitrations which


                                      -32-
<PAGE>


have been asserted or instituted against the Dreyer's Employee Arrangements, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to such Dreyer's Employee
Arrangements or the assets of any of the trusts under any of such Dreyer's
Employee Arrangements which would reasonably be expected to result in any
liability of Dreyer's or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the Department of
the Treasury, the Department of Labor, or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental
Authority, or to any of such Dreyer's Employee Arrangements, any participant in
any such Dreyer's Employee Arrangement, or any other party, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Dreyer's.

          Section 4.20. TAXES. (a) Each of the Dreyer's Entities has duly filed
all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,
complete and accurate in all material respects. Each of the Dreyer's Entities
has paid all Taxes required to be paid by it. The unpaid Taxes of the Dreyer's
Entities do not exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and tax
income) set forth on the Dreyer's Financial Statements, as adjusted for results
of operations and cash flows through the date hereof. There are no pending or,
to the knowledge of Dreyer's, threatened audits, examinations, investigations,
deficiencies, claims or other proceedings in respect of Taxes relating to any of
the Dreyer's Entities, except for those that individually or in the aggregate
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Dreyer's Entities. There are no Liens for Taxes on any asset of any of the
Dreyer's Entities except for Taxes not yet due and payable, Liens for Taxes that
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and Liens for
Taxes that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Dreyer's Entities. None of the Dreyer's
Entities has been a member of any group that has filed a combined, consolidated
or unitary Tax Return other than the affiliated group of corporations of which
Dreyer's is the common parent and as would not individually and in the aggregate
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Dreyer's
Entities. None of the Dreyer's Entities has liability for Taxes of any person
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of U.S.
state or local or foreign law) or other law or by contract or otherwise, except
as a result of the application of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (and any
comparable provision of U.S. state or local or foreign law) to the affiliated
group of corporations of which Dreyer's is the common parent and as would not
individually and in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Dreyer's Entities. None of the Dreyer's Entities has made
any election, or are required, to treat any of the assets owned by such Dreyer's
Entity as owned by another person for tax purposes. None of the Dreyer's
Entities has received or been subject to any written ruling of any Tax Authority
relating to Taxes or entered into any written and legally binding agreement with
any Tax Authority relating to Taxes (and none of the assets owned by any
Dreyer's Entity is subject to or has been the topic of any such agreement).
Dreyer's is not, and has not been, a U.S. real property holding corporation (as
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified
in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

          (b) None of the Dreyer's Entities has taken any action or knows of any
fact that is reasonably likely to prevent (A) the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (B) the
Merger, the Exchange and the Contribution, taken together, from qualifying as a
transaction described in Section 351 of the Code.

          Section 5.2. FILINGS; OTHER ACTIONS; NOTIFICATION. (a) Each of the
parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries,

Affiliates, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and representatives, to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts as soon as practicable to take or
cause to be taken all action, and to do or cause to be done all things,

prepare or present) financial statements or reconciliations other than in

          (b) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable to consult the other parties on, all the information

respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority or any other Person in
connection with the Transactions and any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that either Dreyer's
or Nestle may restrict access to any documents or information to the extent that
it reasonably concludes, after consultation with outside counsel, that (i) any
legal provision of any Governmental Authority applicable to such party requires
such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any properties or
information, (ii) providing such access would result in the loss of the
attorney-client privilege, (iii) such document discusses the pricing or dollar
value of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) the documents
contain competitively sensitive information, the sharing of which could
constitute a violation of any applicable Laws, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the
parties may restrict access to those contracts which by their terms require the
consent of third parties to permit disclosure, if such consent has not been
obtained. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall
act reasonably and as promptly as is practicable.

          (c) The parties hereto shall keep the other parties reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of

enforce any applicable Laws of information and documents reasonably requested by
any such Person or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
Transactions or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the

should be reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid the entry or issuance of
any decree, injunction, or judgment that could delay the closing of the
Transaction beyond the Termination Date; and (iii) use reasonable best efforts
to defend through litigation and to take promptly, in the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other decree, order, judgment, decision
or determination is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered or issued, in any lawsuit, investigation, inquiry, action or proceeding
that would make consummation, in whole or in part, of the Transactions or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Governance Agreement
unlawful or that would prevent or delay, in whole or in part, consummation of
the

                                      -35-
<PAGE>


Transactions or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the
Governance Agreement, any and all steps (including the taking of any appeal, the
posting of any bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of
this paragraph) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction, decree,
order, judgment, decision or determination so as to permit such consummation on
a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement and the
Governance Agreement. The parties agree that none of the steps or actions
required to be taken pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be considered an NICC
Material Adverse Effect or Dreyer's Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, neither party nor any of
their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates shall be required to agree to any
sale, transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of,
or to any prohibition of, or any limitation on, the acquisition, ownership,

asset or assets of Nestle, Dreyer's or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates that individually or in the aggregate would be material (from the
perspective of the parties hereto as to the date hereof) in relation to the
continuing operations of the combined businesses of Dreyer's and NICC and their
consolidated subsidiaries.

          Section 5.3. FURTHER ASSURANCES; ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. (a) The
parties hereto agree that, from time to time, whether before, at or after the
Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as may be necessary to carry
out the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

          (b) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the parties will use
their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the NICC Entities hold only assets
of the Business and liabilities of the Business and no other assets or
liabilities.

          (c) Following the Closing, (A) to the extent any material tangible
assets primarily related to the Business (specifically excluding Business
Intellectual Property Rights and Business Licensed Intellectual Property Rights
and excluding assets used in the international business of Nestle or its
Affiliates) have been retained by Nestle and the Continuing Affiliates, Nestle
shall and shall cause the Continuing Affiliates to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to convey such assets to the NICC Entities as promptly
as practicable (and pending such conveyance to provide the NICC Entities with
the benefit of such assets) and (B) to the extent any material tangible assets
related to, but not primarily related to, the Business (specifically excluding
Business Intellectual Property Rights and excluding assets described in or
related to the services described in Section 3.8 of the Nestle Disclosure

cream or frozen novelty products business of Nestle or its Affiliates). All such
obligations or liabilities shall remain the obligations and liabilities of
Nestle and its Affiliates after the Effective Time, and Nestle shall indemnify
Dreyer's to the extent thereof.

indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or
otherwise facilitate any inquiries (including by way of furnishing any
non-public information or otherwise) or the making of any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any Person which constitutes a Business Combination Proposal with
respect to Dreyer's (or would reasonably be expected to lead to such a Business
Combination Proposal) or (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations regarding a Business Combination Proposal with respect to Dreyer's,
except to notify such person as to the existence of these provisions, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Dreyer's or its
Board of Directors from (A) furnishing non-public information to, or entering

Section 5.9(a), (2) the Board of Directors of Dreyer's believes in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that
such Business Combination Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected

agreement with terms no less restrictive than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement or (B) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Business Combination
Proposal.

          (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "BUSINESS COMBINATION PROPOSAL"
means any direct or indirect inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any (i)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or asset of Dreyer's or

income or assets of Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of equity

more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Dreyer's and its Subsidiaries,

purposes of this Agreement, "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide written

business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Dreyer's
as a result of which the other party thereto or its shareholders shall own 50%
or more of the combined voting power of the entity surviving or resulting from
such transaction (or the ultimate parent entity thereof), and (B) that is (i)
obtained not in breach of this Section 5.9 and (ii) on terms that the Board of
Directors of Dreyer's, or a committee thereof, determines in good faith to be
superior from a financial point of view to its stockholders (other than Nestle
and its Affiliates) to the Transactions (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such Business Combination Proposal including without limitation,
legal and regulatory terms, any break up fees, expense reimbursement provisions,
conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation and the


                                      -43-
<PAGE>


ability of the party making such a proposal to obtain financing for such
Business Combination Proposal and such other factors as the Board deems
relevant.

          (c) Promptly after receipt of any Business Combination Proposal or any
request for non-public information or inquiry which it reasonably believes could
lead to a Business Combination Proposal, Dreyer's shall promptly (but in any
event within one Business Day) notify Nestle orally and in writing of any
Business Combination Proposal or any inquiry regarding the making of any
Business Combination Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of the Person making such Business Combination Proposal or inquiry, the
terms and conditions of any such Business Combination Proposal, request or
inquiry, and a copy of all written materials provided in connection with such
Business Combination Proposal, request or inquiry. After receipt of the Business
Combination Proposal, request or inquiry, Dreyer's shall promptly keep Nestle
informed in all material respects of the status and details (including material
amendments or proposed material amendments thereto) of any such Business
Combination Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly provide to Nestle
(to the extent permitted by law) a copy of all written materials subsequently
provided in connection with such Business Combination Proposal, request or
inquiry.

          (d) If the Board of Directors of Dreyer's or a committee thereof
determines that a Business Combination Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
Dreyer's shall promptly provide written notice to Nestle which notice shall
include a description of all the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal (the "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL NOTICE").

          (e) Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement) providing for any
Business Combination Proposal or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend any Business Combination Proposal, in each case unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

          (f) This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions abandoned by
Dreyer's at any time prior to the Dreyer's Stockholder Meeting if each of the
following conditions is met:

               (i) Dreyer's is not in breach of Section 5.9 of this Agreement;

               (ii) Dreyer's shall have received a Superior Proposal prior to
     the date of the Dreyer's Stockholders Meeting, delivered a Superior
     Proposal Notice to Nestle and notified Nestle of its intent to terminate
     this Agreement;

               (iii) During the five Business Day period following Nestle's
     receipt from Dreyer's of a Superior Proposal Notice, (x) if requested by
     Nestle, Dreyer's shall have provided Nestle with a reasonable opportunity
     to revise this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements so that the Business
     Combination Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal no longer
     constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) Nestle shall have failed to make an
     offer to Dreyer's that the Board of Directors of Dreyer's shall have
     reasonably concluded, in good faith (after consultation with its financial
     advisors and


                                      -44-
<PAGE>


     outside legal counsel), would cause the Business Combination that is the
     subject of the Superior Proposal Notice, in light of such offer, to no
     longer be a Superior Proposal; and

               (iv) Dreyer's shall have made the payment of the termination fee
     required by Section 10.3(a).

          (g) Dreyer's shall immediately as of the date hereof, terminate, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Dreyer's Representatives to
immediately terminate, all discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third
party with respect to, or any that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Business Combination Proposal. Dreyer's shall immediately demand that each
person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with Dreyer's
or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of the Dreyer's Representatives
with respect to such Person's consideration of a possible Business Combination
Proposal to immediately return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished by Dreyer's or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any
of the Dreyer's Representatives to such Person or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries or any of the Dreyer's Representatives.

          (h) Dreyer's hereby waives the provisions of Section 6.1 of the Nestle
Stock Purchase Agreement with respect to any proposal made by Nestle pursuant to
Section 5.9(f)(iii).

          (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the prohibitions contained in Sections 5.4(b) (i), (xvii) or (xviii)
shall not be applicable with respect to a Person who has submitted a Superior
Proposal to Dreyer's.

          Section 5.10. PROXY STATEMENT; REGISTRATION STATEMENT; BLUE SKY. (a)

and New Dreyer's shall file as promptly as practicable the Registration
Statement (together with all amendments thereto, the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT"),
which shall include the proxy statement to be sent to Dreyer's stockholders in
connection with the Dreyer's Stockholders Meeting (the "DREYER'S PROXY

comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of New Dreyer's,
Dreyer's and Nestle shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after such
filing. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement
shall be made by Dreyer's, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Dreyer's Proxy Statement shall be made by Dreyer's, in each case, without
providing Nestle a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, which
comments shall be considered in good faith. Each of Dreyer's and Nestle will
advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Dreyer's Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Dreyer's Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Registration Statement or the Dreyer's Proxy Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information.

          (b) New Dreyer's, Dreyer's and Nestle each agrees, as to itself and
its Affiliates, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or
its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement or the Dreyer's Proxy Statement, and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective and on
the date of mailing of the Dreyer's Proxy Statement to stockholders and at the
time or times of the Dreyer's Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at
any time prior to the date of the Dreyer's Stockholders Meeting any information
relating to New Dreyer's, Dreyer's or Nestle, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by New Dreyer's,
Dreyer's or Nestle which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Registration Statement or the Dreyer's Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and, to the extent required by applicable law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
promptly with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
Dreyer's stockholders.

          (c) Each of New Dreyer's, Dreyer's and Nestle will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Dreyer's Proxy Statement, respectively, to be mailed
to the Dreyer's stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

          (d) As promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Nestle shall complete the preparation of and deliver to Dreyer's and
New Dreyer's complete copies of the audited consolidated statements of income,
balance sheets and statements of cash flows, including all related notes and
schedules thereto, of NICC as of and for the twelve months ended December 31,
2001, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Nestle shall use reasonable best efforts
to also deliver to Dreyer's as promptly as practicable such other financial
statements or information relating to the NICC Entities as Dreyer's or New
Dreyer's may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the
Registration Statement and the clearance of the Registration Statement by the
SEC.

          (e) Each of New Dreyer's, Dreyer's and Nestle will use its respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time all necessary
state securities or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to permit the
distribution of the shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

          Section 5.11. STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING; BOARD RECOMMENDATION. Dreyer's
will take all action necessary to convene a meeting of the stockholders of
Dreyer's at which the stockholders of Dreyer's shall consider approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the "DREYER'S STOCKHOLDERS MEETING")
as promptly as practicable after the Dreyer's Proxy Statement has been cleared
by the SEC; PROVIDED that the meeting shall be scheduled for not later than 45
days from the date the Dreyer's Proxy Statement is mailed to stockholders of
Dreyer's (or, subject to applicable Law, earlier if such scheduled date would
otherwise be within five Business Days prior to the TERMINATION DATE) unless
Nestle agrees to or specifies a longer period


                                      -46-
<PAGE>


of time. In connection with the Dreyer's Stockholders Meeting and the
transactions contemplated hereby, Dreyer's will (i) subject to applicable Law,
use its reasonable best efforts (including postponing or adjourning the Dreyer's
Stockholders Meeting for up to 30 days (or until such earlier time as the
previously established record date for such meeting would no longer be valid) to
obtain a quorum or to solicit additional proxies) to obtain the necessary
approvals by its stockholders of this Agreement and the Merger and (ii)
otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to the Dreyer's
Stockholders Meeting. The Board of Directors of Dreyer's shall recommend to its
stockholders the approval of the matters to be submitted to its stockholders at
the Dreyer's Stockholders Meeting, which recommendation shall be set forth in
the Dreyer's Proxy Statement and shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit
approval, except that the Dreyer's Board of Directors may, to the extent
required, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Nestle such recommendation
if the Dreyer's Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation
with, outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order for the
Dreyer's directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to Dreyer's
stockholders under applicable law; it being understood that the obligation of
Dreyer's and its Board of Directors' to use reasonable best efforts to solicit
and obtain such approval and to otherwise comply with their other obligations
under this Agreement shall not be affected by the Dreyer's Board of Directors'
decision to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Nestle such recommendation
(except for the act of such withdrawal or modification). The Dreyer's
Stockholders Meeting will be held regardless of any failure to make such
recommendation or any change in such recommendation.

          Section 5.12. CERTAIN NOTICES. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the
other party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that
would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (b) the failure of Dreyer's or Nestle, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not be satisfied;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.12
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to
comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

          Section 5.13. GOVERNANCE AGREEMENT. Nestle and New Dreyer's each agree
to execute the Governance Agreement, in the form set forth in Exhibit D hereto
("GOVERNANCE AGREEMENT"), at or immediately prior to the Effective Time.

          Section 5.14. NASDAQ LISTING. Dreyer's, New Dreyer's and Nestle shall
cooperate with each other and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the Nasdaq National Market System, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date; PROVIDED, that such reasonable best efforts
shall not require either party to forego any financial benefit or other benefit
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Governance Agreement,
other than agreeing to the modifications contemplated by Section 3.03(a) of the
Governance Agreement to the extent such action would be required thereunder).

          Section 5.15. DREYER'S RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of Dreyer's will take the requisite action such that (i)
neither Nestle nor any of its Affiliates shall become an "Acquiring Person," and
no "Share Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" (as such terms are defined in
the Dreyer's Rights Agreement) will occur, solely by reason of the approval,
execution or delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (ii) the
Dreyer's Rights Agreement will terminate and the Rights will expire concurrently
with the Effective Time.

          Section 5.16. THE NESTLE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT. Dreyer's hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereunder has not breached or violated the
standstill and/or transfer restrictions contained in Section 6.1 of the Nestle
Stock Purchase Agreement, and that the execution of this Agreement, the
performance by Nestle and/or its Affiliates of their obligations hereunder and
the enforcement by Nestle and/or its Affiliates of their rights hereunder does
not and will not breach or violate the standstill and/or transfer restrictions
contained in Section 6.1 of the Nestle Stock Purchase Agreement. Nestle and
Dreyer's agree that at the Effective Time, the Nestle Stock Purchase Agreement
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect effective as of the

                            EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS

          Section 6.1. NICC SEVERANCE AND RETENTION PLANS. At any time prior to
the Effective Time, Nestle and its Subsidiaries may adopt a severance plan and a
retention plan for NICC employees consistent with the terms and conditions set
forth in the term sheets set forth in Section 6.1 of the Nestle Disclosure
Schedule; PROVIDED, that Dreyer's shall have the right to review and comment
upon all plan documents, plan summaries, participant communications and other
writings setting forth the terms and conditions of such plans, and no such
documents, communications or writings shall be adopted or disseminated to NICC
employees without the prior approval of Dreyer's, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. After the Effective Time, New Dreyer's shall cause NICC
to continue such plans according to their terms without any change adverse to
the employees covered thereunder, until all payments required to be made
thereunder have been made.

          Section 6.2. NICC BONUS PLANS. If the Effective Time occurs prior to
December 31, 2002, Nestle may either (i) at any time prior to the Effective
Time, terminate NICC annual bonus and long-term incentive plans and pay pro-rata
bonuses to the plans' participants with respect to the truncated performance
period ending on the date of the termination of such plans based on actual
performance during the truncated period or (ii) maintain such plans as in effect
immediately prior to the date hereof until December 31, 2002. In any event, if
the Effective Time occurs on or prior to December 31, 2002, Nestle shall ensure
that NICC does not establish any new performance periods thereunder. If the
Effective Time occurs after December 31, 2002, NICC may establish new
performance periods under its annual bonus and long term incentive plans
commencing on January 1, 2003, on terms and conditions consistent with its past
practice; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if NICC chooses to establish such new


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

rights of participants to purchase shares of Dreyer's Common Stock under the
open offering period ending February 25, 2003 (the "LAST OFFERING PERIOD") shall

will be offered to participants under the Dreyer's ESPP and (iv) the Dreyer's
ESPP will be terminated effective as of the completion of the Last Offering

substantially comparable to those provided to the employees of Dreyer's and its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time, excluding any stock option,
stock purchase or other equity compensation plans maintained by Dreyer's and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and not taking into account the LTIP,

necessary to provide benefits and compensation that are competitive with changes
in market practice.

benefits but not for pension accruals, the Employees shall receive service
credit for service with Dreyer's, NICC and their respective Subsidiaries and

terms and conditions of the employment of the Employees, except to the extent
provided otherwise by any written employment agreement with the Employee. No
provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in
any Employee, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and benefits that may be provided to any Employee or

hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action. The parties
further agree, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, that any final and
unappealable judgment against any of them in any Action contemplated above shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside
the U.S. by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

          (c) To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter may acquire
any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, such
party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with
respect to this Agreement.

          (d) Each party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party certifies that it has been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications set forth above in this Section 11.2.

          Section 11.3. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement and the
Governance Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no agreements,
understandings, representations or warranties between the parties other than
those set forth or referred to herein. Nothing expressed, referred to or implied
by or in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person (other than the
parties to this Agreement) any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under

Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and
assigns permitted by Section 11.6.

          Section 11.6. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no party hereto will assign its
rights or delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without
the express prior written consent of each other party hereto. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person that is not a party to this
Agreement any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

          Section 11.7. HEADINGS; DEFINITIONS. The section and article headings
contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and
will not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All references
to Sections or Articles contained herein mean Sections or Articles of this
Agreement unless otherwise stated. All capitalized terms defined herein are
equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. The
terms "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import shall,
unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including all of the Exhibits hereto) and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. The word "including" and words of similar import


                                      -59-
<PAGE>


when used in this Agreement shall mean "including without limitation" unless the
context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified. All references in this
Agreement to any period of days shall be deemed to be to the relevant number of
calendar days unless otherwise specified.

          Section 11.8. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. This Agreement may not be
modified or amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by
the party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is
sought; provided, that after the Effective Time, an amendment by Dreyer's shall
require action by a majority of the non-Nestle nominees of the Dreyer's Board of
Directors. Any party hereto may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by another party hereto with any term or provision of this Agreement
on the part of such other party hereto to be performed or complied with. The
waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any term or provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

          Section 11.9. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any party fails to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance in
such event, in addition to any other remedy or law or in equity.

          Section 11.10. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

          Section 11.11. MUTUAL DRAFTING. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties.
