resolve such dispute between them. If they are unable  to  resolve the
dispute within 30 days after the delivery of the Contingent Payment  Dispute
Notice, then the dispute shall be submitted to the CPA Firm for 
determination in accordance with the following provisions:

 

 

(i) The  Buyer  and the Seller shall submit to the CPA Firm, within 10 days

of the engagement  letter), copies of (A) the Contingent Payment Statement
for the applicable  Contingent Payment Period, (B) the Contingent Payment
Dispute Notice and  (C) a list of all unresolved differences between the

copy delivered  to the other party on the same day), within 30 days after the

other party on the same day), within 60  days  after the date of the
engagement of the CPA Firm, a memorandum responding to  the  initial
memorandum submitted to the CPA Firm by the other party. Unless  requested by
the CPA Firm in writing, neither the Buyer nor the Seller may  present any
additional information or arguments to the CPA Firm, either orally  or in
writing; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  each party shall have the right
to respond to the CPA Firm's requests directed  to the other party.

writing setting forth  the CPA Firm's determination, only with respect to the
Unresolved Differences,  whether and to what extent, if any, the Contingent
Payment for such Contingent  Payment Period requires adjustment and the CPA
Firm's reasons therefor. Any  decision rendered by the CPA Firm shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon  the parties hereto, and judgment thereon
may be entered and enforced in any  court of competent jurisdiction.

 

 

(iii) The  fees  and expenses of the CPA Firm in connection with the
resolution of disputes  pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be shared
equally by the Buyer and the  Seller; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if 
the CPA Firm determines that one party has adopted a position or positions 
that  is or are frivolous or clearly without merit, the CPA Firm may, in
its  discretion, assign a greater portion of such fees and expenses to such 
party.

 

 

(e) Subject  to Section 2.10(f), the Buyer shall pay the net amount of the
Contingent  Payment specified in the Contingent Payment Statement (exclusive
of any Tax,  fees or other expenses of any kind), if any, to the Seller on
the Result  Announcement Date immediately succeeding June 29, 2008 or June
28,  2009, as the case may be, or, with respect to any increase in such
Contingent  Payment finally determined in accordance with Section 2.10(d),
within five  Business Days after the date of such final determination, in
each case in cash  or Buyer Common Stock or any combination thereof, in the
Buyer's sole  discretion; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  in no event,
shall the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued  by  the Buyer
pursuant to this Section 2.10(e), when combined with the Purchase  Price
Shares and any other Contingent Payment Shares previously issued, exceed 
9.99% of the outstanding Buyer Common Stock at the close of the Nasdaq
Global  Market's trading day immediately preceding the issuance date of the
relevant  Contingent Payment Shares (taking into account such Contingent
Payment Shares  as  if already issued and outstanding); _provided_ , 
_further_ ,  that,  in no event, shall the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock to be issued  by  the Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.10(e) exceed
19.99% of the outstanding  Buyer Common Stock at any time between the date of
this Agreement and the Final  Contingent Payment Date. If the Buyer
determines that any Contingent Payment  or  portion thereof will be made in
cash, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller such  cash amount on the relevant
Result Announcement Date (or such later date as  is  contemplated by this
Section 2.10(e)) in U.S. dollars by wire transfer of  immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Seller. If the  Buyer  determines any
Contingent Payment or portion thereof will be made in Buyer  Common Stock,
the Buyer shall issue to the Seller on the relevant Result  Announcement Date
(or such later date as is contemplated by this  Section 2.10(e)) such
aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common Stock  equal to (A) the amount of
such Contingent Payment or portion thereof  divided by (B) the relevant
Average Closing Price. With respect to any  decrease in a Contingent Payment
specified in the Contingent Payment Statement  finally determined in
accordance with Section 2.10(d), the Seller shall,  within five Business Days
after the date of such final determination, refund  such amount to the Buyer
in cash in U.S. dollars by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to
an account designated by the Buyer.

(f) Not  less  than 10 Business Days prior to the Result Announcement Date,
the Seller shall  deliver to the Buyer a written notice setting forth the
names of then-current  employees of the Business selected to share in an
amount in cash equal to 5%  of  the Contingent Payment specified in the
Contingent Payment Statement, if any  (the " _Contingent  Bonus Amount_
"),  and  the portion of such Contingent Bonus Amount (expressed as a
percentage) to  which  each such employee should be allocated. The Buyer
shall have the right to  approve the employees selected and their proposed
allocations, which approval  will not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in  this Agreement, the Buyer
shall withhold from any payment to be made to the  Seller pursuant to Section
2.10(e) the Contingent Bonus Amount and shall  cause the Company to pay an
amount in cash equal to such Contingent Bonus  Amount, less any Taxes
required to be paid or withheld by the Company and other  required
withholdings, on the Result Announcement Date to such employees and  in 
such amounts as are specified in the written notice from the Seller and
approved  by the Buyer or otherwise agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller. To
the extent  that the Buyer and the Seller are unable to reach agreement prior
to the Result  Announcement Date on the employees selected and their proposed
allocations  for  purposes of payment of the Contingent Bonus Amount, the
Buyer shall pay the  Contingent Bonus Amount (or the relevant portion
thereof) to the Seller, in  cash  or Buyer Common Stock or any combination
thereof, in the Buyer's sole  discretion, in accordance with Section 2.10(e).

 

 

(g) From  the  Closing Date through June 28, 2009, except as otherwise
contemplated by  this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Buyer shall
use commercially  reasonable efforts to operate the Business in a manner
consistent with  maximizing the Contingent Payments and shall cause the
business of the Company  and its Subsidiaries to be limited to the Business;
notwithstanding the  foregoing, the Buyer shall be permitted to take any
action that is:  (i) consented to in writing by the Seller, which consent
shall not be  unreasonably withheld, (ii) required by Law, or (iii) in the
best  interests of the Business (including all Subsidiaries) as determined in
good  faith by the Buyer (but excluding for purposes of such determination
the  possible benefit of a reduction in the Contingent Payments). The Buyer
will  provide the financial support contemplated by the Two-Year Forecast to
the  extent that the Business is achieving the financial performance
contemplated  in  the Two-Year Forecast; however, to the extent that the
Buyer determines in  good  faith that a material deviation in the financial
performance contemplated in  the  Two-Year Forecast is in the best interests
of the Business (including all its  Subsidiaries) and to the extent that such
deviation would not maximize the  Contingent Payments, then the Buyer shall
not implement any such planned  deviation unless it is consented to in
writing by the Seller, which consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
parties agree that their post-Closing  obligations under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements are essential  to  the operation and performance of
the Business. From the Closing Date through  June 28, 2009, the parties shall
timely comply with all provisions of this  Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. In the case of any breach of this  Section 2.10(g), the non-
breaching party may seek damages for such breach,  but shall be required to
prove its damages for such breach and the Contingent  Payment shall not be
deemed to be liquidated damages.

parties or (B) violate any obligation of the Seller with  respect to
confidentiality so long as, with respect to confidentiality, the  Seller has
made reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver regarding the possible  disclosure
from the third party to whom it owes an obligation of  confidentiality. No

Securities Laws.  The Seller shall furnish to the Buyer the information to be
included in such  application. The Seller and the Buyer will respond to any
comments from the  Administrator and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an order  of approval from the Administrator (the "

after such filing. Neither of the parties  to this Agreement shall make at
such hearing, or include in any information  supplied with such application
or distributed at such hearing, any untrue  statement of a material fact or

in order to make the statements therein, in light  of  the circumstances

securities in a private placement in  accordance with applicable Securities
Laws.  If  the Administrator shall not have granted a North Carolina Permit
within 60  days  after the date of this Agreement and the Agreement has not
been terminated  pursuant to Article VIII hereof, the Buyer shall issue the
Share Consideration  as restricted securities in a private placement in
accordance with applicable  Securities Laws.  The  Shareholders' and
Registration Rights Agreement contains, among other things,  various
additional representations and undertakings necessary in order to enable  the
Buyer to utilize a private placement exemption under the Securities Act 
and  certain obligations of the Buyer to file one or more registration
statements  on  Form S-3 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act
with respect to  the Share Consideration, subject to the terms of the
Shareholders' and  Registration Rights Agreement, at the Buyer's expense. 
The  Buyer shall take any action required to be taken under Securities Laws

any proposed understanding,  undertaking or agreement with, any Government
Entity regarding any such  application. Neither the Seller nor the Buyer
shall participate in any meeting  with any Government Entity in respect of

meeting. The parties will consult and cooperate  with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,  memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or  on  behalf of
either party in connection with the making of an application to the 
Administrator, including, with respect to making a particular filing, by

indirectly relating to or arising out of any liability for Taxes imposed on 
the  Transferred Subsidiaries or for which the Transferred Subsidiaries may

sentence) within 10 days prior to the due date for the filing of such  Tax
Returns, and the Buyer shall timely pay, and indemnify the Seller for,  all 
other Taxes imposed on the Transferred Subsidiaries for the periods, or
portions  thereof, ending after the Closing Date.

(i) The  Buyer  shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by
the Buyer or any  of  its Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local  or  foreign income or franchise tax audits or
assessments that may affect the Tax  Liabilities of the Company or any of the
other Transferred Subsidiaries for  which the Seller would be required to
indemnify the Buyer pursuant to  Section 5.4(a); _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  failure to comply with this provision shall not affect the Buyer's
right to  indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Seller is
materially  prejudiced by such failure.

 

 

(ii) The  Seller shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the
defense of  any  claim for Taxes for which the Seller may be required to
indemnify the Buyer  under Section 5.4(a). Neither the Buyer nor the

of the year or period ending  on the Closing Date that may be the subject of
indemnification by the Seller  under Section 5.4(a) without the prior written

delayed).

reasonably deems necessary in connection with  the filing of any Tax Returns,
the preparation for any audit by any taxing  authority, the response to any
inquiry by a taxing authority, the mailing or  filing of any notice and the

stamp, documentary or other similar  Taxes and fees (collectively, the "
_Transfer  Taxes_ "),  that  are payable or that arise as a result of the
consummation of the transactions  between the Seller and the Buyer
contemplated by this Agreement, and any  recording or filing fees with
respect thereto, will be shared equally by the  Seller and the Buyer. The
party that has the primary legal responsibility for  the payment of any
particular Transfer Tax shall prepare and timely file all  relevant Tax
Returns required to be filed in respect of such Transfer Tax and  pay the
Transfer Tax shown on such Tax return. The parties hereto agree that,  as

after  the execution thereof by the Buyer or, if the second day thereafter is
not  a  Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day), the
bought and sold  notes and instruments of transfer in respect of the
Transferred Shares shall  be  submitted by the counsel designated by the
Buyer to the Stamp Office for  adjudication. Each of the Buyer and the Seller
shall cooperate with the other  in  submitting necessary documentation for

in this Section 5.4 shall remain in  effect until the expiration of the
applicable statute of  limitations.

the Buyer in making any and all appropriate  government filings, giving
employee notices or taking any other actions  reasonably necessary to
maintain, amend, terminate and administer the  Compensation Plans as the
Buyer deems fit, subject to  Section 5.5(d).

 

 

(b) Prior  to  making any written or oral communications to any Employee
pertaining to  compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, the Seller shall provide the
Buyer with a copy  of the intended communication, the Buyer shall have a
reasonable period of  time  to review and comment on the communication, and
the Buyer and the Seller shall  cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication.

 

 

(c) At  least  five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall have delivered  to  the Buyer evidence satisfactory to the Buyer that,

that are contingent  on a change of ownership or effective control of a
corporation (or contingent  on  a change in the ownership of a substantial
portion of the assets of a  corporation) such payments are not "parachute
payments" (as defined under  Section 280G of the Code), including, as
appropriate, evidence that the  Seller's shareholders have approved such

in or owns or controls a  significant interest in any entity that engages in,

disclose, directly or indirectly, to any Person any  confidential information
concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries or the  Business except as necessary

its Affiliates receives an offer for such a transaction,  the Seller will
provide the Buyer with notice thereof as soon as practicable  after receipt
thereof, which notice may, in the Seller's sole discretion,  include the
identity of the prospective buyer or soliciting party.

 

 

(b) The  parties acknowledge that there may be no adequate remedy at law for
a breach  of  Section 5.9(a) and that money damages may not be an
appropriate remedy for  breach of such Section. Therefore, the parties agree
that the Buyer has the  right to injunctive relief and specific performance

that, from and after the Closing, it shall indemnify, defend  and hold
harmless the Seller and its Representatives and their heirs, successors  and
permitted assigns, each in its capacity as such (the " _Seller  Indemnified
Parties_ ")  from,  against and in respect of any Losses imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered  by, or asserted against, any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties, whether in  respect of third-party claims, claims
between the parties hereto, or otherwise,  directly or indirectly relating
to, arising out of or resulting from,  (i) subject to Section 7.3(b) hereof
,  any  breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
the Buyer  contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement for the
period such  representation or warranty survives, _it_ _being_ _understood_
___that_ ,  for  purposes of this Section 7.3(a)(i), any qualifications
relating to  materiality contained in such representation or warranty shall
be disregarded  for purposes of determining whether such representation or
warranty was  breached,  (ii) any breach, violation or non-fulfillment of a
covenant or agreement of  the Buyer contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, and  (iii) the Transferred Shares, the assets of the
Transferred Subsidiaries,  or the Business to the extent attributable to the
operation or ownership of  the  Business following the Closing and not
otherwise an Excluded  Liability.

 

 

(b) The  Buyer  shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for
any individual Loss  with respect to the matters contained in Section
7.3(a)(i) (other than  breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties contained in  Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.6, which shall be
indemnified without regard to the  following limitations) unless (i) such
individual Loss exceeds the  Individual Indemnity Threshold and (ii) the
aggregate amount of all such  Losses, other than any individual Loss that is
equal to or below the Individual  Indemnity Threshold, exceeds the Aggregate
Indemnity Threshold, in which case  the Buyer shall be liable for all of such
Losses; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Buyer shall not be required to
make any payments to the Seller Indemnified  Parties pursuant to clauses (i)
and (ii) of Section 7.3(a) in excess  of an aggregate amount equal to
$50,000,000. For avoidance of any doubt, each  individual Loss that is equal
to or below the Individual Indemnity Threshold  shall be excluded from any
calculation of the aggregate amount of Losses in  clause (ii) of this Section
7.3(b) and from any calculation of the  Buyer's indemnity obligation under
this Section 7.3.

Section  7.4 _Third-Party  Claim Indemnification Procedures_.  (a) If  any
written claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an " _Indemnifying 
Party_ ")  may  have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder (other
than a claim brought  with respect to Tax Liabilities under Section 5.4,
which shall be governed  by that Section), is asserted against or sought to
be collected from any  Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third-Party 
Claim_ "),  such  Indemnified Party shall promptly (but no later than 20
Business Days after  receipt thereof) notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of such Third-Party  Claim (a " _Third-Party  Claim Notice_ ," 
collectively with Direct Claim Notices, " _Claim  Notices_ ");  _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  the failure timely to give a Third-Party Claim Notice
shall affect the rights  of  an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the
extent that such failure has a  material prejudicial effect on the defenses
or other rights available to the  Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third-Party Claim. A Third-Party Claim  Notice shall contain a brief summary
of the facts underlying or relating to  such  claim to the extent then known
by the Indemnified Party or a copy of any  correspondence or notice received
from the relevant third party and a statement  that the Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification for Losses relating to such  Third-Party Claim.

 

 

(b) The  Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days (or such lesser number of days
set forth  in the Third-Party Claim Notice as may be required by any
Government Entity,  court proceeding or regulatory inquiry or investigation)
after receipt of the  Third-Party Claim Notice (the " _Notice  Period_ ") 
to  notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified
Party  against such Third-Party Claim unless the Third Party Claim involves
criminal  liability or in which equitable relief is sought against any of the
Indemnified  Parties; _it_ _being_ _understood_ _that_ ,  by  assuming the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall  acknowledge its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect  to  all Losses
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against  the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim (subject only to 
the  limitations contained in Section 7.2(b) or 7.3(b), as the case may be,
and  any amounts actually recovered as contemplated by Section 7.8(a)) and
all  Losses sustained, incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party in
connection  with such defense prior to such assumption shall be reimbursed by
the  Indemnifying Party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  67  -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) In  the  event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party within the  Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified
Party against a  Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend the  Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings, with
counsel selected by the  Indemnifying Party that is reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party,  at  the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Once
the Indemnifying Party has duly  assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall have  the  right, but not the obligation, to
participate in any such defense, including  the  opportunity to participate
in any discussions or correspondence with any  Government Entity, and to
employ separate counsel of its choosing. The  Indemnified Party shall
participate in any such defense at its own expense  unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named  parties to the
proceedings and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have  reasonably
concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel  would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between  them or
the availability to the Indemnified Party of one or more defenses or 
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be 
available to the Indemnifying Party in respect thereof, or (ii) the 
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim after the 
Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third-Party Claim it
has  assumed, as provided in Section 7.4(d).

 

 

(d) If  the  Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified
Party against a  Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified
Party timely notice  of  its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) is not
entitled to defend the  Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 7.4(b), or
(iii) after  assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to take
reasonable steps  necessary to negotiate for settlement or defend diligently
such Third-Party  Claim within 10 Business Days after receiving written
notice from the  Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying Party
has so failed,  the  Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume its  own defense; _it_ _being_ _understood_ _that_  
the  Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third-Party Claim
shall not  be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party
Claim. 

 

 

(e) Whether  or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed defense of a
Third-Party Claim,  (i) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with
respect to any  settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim effected
without its written  consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and (ii) the  Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the  Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), consent  to  the entry of judgment, admit any
liability with respect to, settle, compromise,  discharge or offer to settle,
compromise or discharge any Third-Party Claim  on a  basis that would result
in (A) the imposition of a consent order,  injunction or decree that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of  the  Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates, (B) a finding or admission of a  violation of Law or
violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified  Party or any of its
Affiliates, (C) a finding or admission of a violation  of Law, of a violation
of the rights of any Person or that would have an adverse  effect on other
claims made or threatened against the Indemnified Party or  any  of its
Affiliates, or (D) except to the extent within the basket set forth  in
Section 7.2(b) or 7.3(b), as the case may be, any monetary liability of  the
Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the 
Indemnifying Party or anything less than a complete release being provided 
to  the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  68  -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) The  Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
order to ensure  the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim,
including by providing  access during regular business hours to each other's
relevant business records  and other documents, and employees; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  such cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with
the business or  operations of the providing party. All Losses sustained,
incurred or suffered  by  the Indemnified Party in connection with
responding to, complying with or  satisfying the Indemnifying Party's
requests for cooperation shall be promptly  reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes the  amount of, or otherwise
refuses or fails to reimburse, any such Losses that  the  Indemnified Party
has incurred and for which the Indemnified Party has sought  reimbursement
from the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall not  be  obligated
to continue providing cooperation with respect to the defense of  the 
relevant Third-Party Claim until such dispute has become the subject of a
Final  Determination or all such Losses have been reimbursed in full.

 

 

(g) The  Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable
best efforts  to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable  Law), and to cause all communications among employees,
counsel and others  representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made
so as to preserve  any  applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges.

 

 

Section  7.5 _Direct  Claims_.  (a)  If an  Indemnified Party wishes to
make a claim for indemnification hereunder for  a  Loss that does not result
from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct  Claim_ "),  the  Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Direct  Claim (a "
_Direct  Claim Notice_ "),  including a brief summary of the facts
underlying or related to such claim  to  the extent then known by the
Indemnified Party and a statement that the  Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification for Losses relating to such claim.  The  Indemnifying Party
shall have a period of 30 days within which to respond to  such Direct Claim.

 

 

(b) If  the  Indemnifying Party accepts the Direct Claim or does not respond
within such  30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
accepted the Direct  Claim and to have conclusively acknowledged its
obligation to indemnify the  Indemnified Party with respect to all Losses
imposed on, sustained, incurred  or  suffered by, or asserted against the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Direct  Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
accepts or is deemed to accept the Direct  Claim, within 30 days after the
date of such acceptance, it shall pay the amount  of Losses (if any)
specified in the Direct Claim Notice for which the  Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification at that time (which amount shall not  be  conclusive of the
final amount of such Direct Claim) and any amount of Losses  specified in any
supplementary Direct Claim Notice contemplated by  Section 7.6(b). In the
event that the Indemnifying Party is the Seller, it  shall have the option to
either pay the foregoing amount of Losses in cash  or  instruct the Escrow
Agent to release to the Buyer such portion of the Purchase  Price Shares held
in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as directed by  the  Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  69  -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If  the  Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part of the Direct Claim
within the 30-day  period after the date of the Direct Claim Notice, or fails
to pay any Losses  in  accordance with Section 7.5(b), the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified  Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such
dispute on the Direct Claim  during the 30-day period following the delivery
of a response reflecting such  dispute. If the dispute is not resolved within
such 30-day period, the  Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
submit the dispute to  arbitration pursuant to Section 9.9 below.

 

 

Section  7.6 _Claim  Notices_.  (a)  A Claim  Notice shall state the
estimated amount of Losses (which estimate shall not  be  conclusive of the
final amount of such claim and subsequently may be  supplemented or amended
as contemplated by Section 7.6(b)) that the  Indemnified Party believes it
has sustained, incurred or suffered with respect  to any Third-Party Claim or
Direct Claim and identify the representations and  warranties of the
Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party believes were  breached or
inaccurate or otherwise identify the bases upon which the  Indemnified Party
believes that it is entitled to indemnification (which bases  shall not be
conclusive of the final determination of liability for  indemnification and
subsequently may be supplemented or amended as contemplated  by Section
7.6(b)).

 

 

(b) At  any  time after an Indemnified Party has delivered a Claim Notice
satisfying the  content requirements of Section 7.4(a) or 7.5(a), such
Indemnified Party,  in its discretion, may supplement or amend such Claim
Notice by delivery of  any  correspondence, notice or other information
relating to the claim covered by  the  original Claim Notice. For the
avoidance of doubt, the delivery by the  Indemnified Party of one or more
supplements or amendments to a Claim Notice,  to  the extent such
supplements or amendments do not include new Claims being made  after the
expiration of the relevant survival period set forth in  Section 7.1, shall
not be deemed the delivery of a new Claim Notice or the  revocation of the
original Claim Notice, and shall not alter or undermine the  timeliness of
the original Claim Notice, for purposes of  Section 7.1.

 

 

Section  7.7 _Consequential  Damages_.  The  parties hereto acknowledge
that, except with respect to Third-Party Claims,  Losses shall not include
any consequential, punitive, special, incidental and  indirect damages,
including lost profits.

 

 

Section  7.8 _Adjustments  to Losses_.  (a) _Insurance_.  In  calculating
the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually received by the  Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance policy or  pursuant to any
claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other  Person in
each case relating to the Third-Party Claim or the Direct Claim,  net  of
any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection with securing 
or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted, except to the extent that the 
adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage of all or part 
of  such Loss. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts  to  assert any rights or make any claim or demand under any
insurance policy  relating to any Third-Party Claim or Direct Claim or any
occurrence, claim  or  Loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying
Party under this Article  VII.  No Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
be subrogated to any rights of an  Indemnified Party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  70  -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Purchase  Price Adjustment_.  In  calculating the amount of any Loss
for which any Buyer Indemnified Party is  entitled to indemnification
hereunder, the amount of any reserve or other  negative provision reflected
in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement  related to such Loss shall be
deducted.

 

 

(c) _Reimbursement_.  If an  Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a
third party in respect of a Loss  that is the subject of indemnification
hereunder after all or a portion of  such  Loss has been paid by an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VII, the  Indemnified Party shall
promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess  (if  any) of (i) the
amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such  Loss (or, where the
Seller is the Indemnifying Party, any amount paid by the  Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement), plus the amount actually  received from
the third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount  of Loss.

 

 

(d) _Escrow  Agreement_.  If,  pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Buyer
receives an amount from the Escrow  Agent in respect of a Loss that is the
subject of indemnification by the Seller  hereunder, the Buyer shall not be
entitled to seek enforcement of its rights  to  indemnification directly
against the Seller with respect to such  amount.

 

 

Section  7.9 _Payments_.  The  Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts
payable pursuant to this Article VII  by  wire transfer of immediately
available funds, promptly following receipt from  an  Indemnified Party of a
bill, together with all accompanying reasonably detailed  back-up
documentation, for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification  hereunder,
unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Loss, in  which
event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party. In any event, the 
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of 
immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for which it is liable 
hereunder no later than five Business Days following any Final Determination 
of  such Loss and the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor. A " _Final 
Determination_ " shall  exist when (i) the parties to the dispute have
reached an agreement in  writing, (ii) a Government Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have  entered a final and binding order or judgment, or
(iii) an arbitration or  like panel shall have rendered a determination or
award with respect to disputes  the parties have agreed to submit thereto. In
the event that the Indemnifying  Party is the Seller, it shall have the
option to either pay the foregoing amount  of Losses in cash or instruct the
Escrow Agent to release to the Buyer such  portion of the Purchase Price
Shares held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow  Agreement as directed by the
Seller.

 

 

Section  7.10 _Characterization  of Indemnification Payments_.  To the 
extent allowed under applicable Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying
Party  to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to Section
7.2 or  7.3 hereof shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for
Tax  purposes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  71  -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  7.11 _Tax  Indemnification_.  To the  extent that the Buyer has a
claim against the Seller with respect to Taxes  and  the Buyer may pursue
such claim under Section 7.2 or Section 5.4, the  Buyer may bring such claim
against the Seller under either one (but not both)  of  those Sections. If
the Buyer chooses to bring a claim under Section 5.4,  the provisions of this
Article VII shall not apply to such claim.

 

 

Section  7.12 _Effect  of Waiver of Condition_. **** Neither  the Buyer's
nor the Seller's right to indemnity pursuant to this Article VII  shall be
adversely affected by its waiver of a condition to Closing set forth  in 
Article VI, unless such party makes clear by the terms of its waiver that it 
is  foreclosing its right to indemnity with respect to the matter that is
the  subject of the waiver.

 

 

_ARTICLE  VIII_

 

 

_TERMINATION_

 

 

Section  8.1 _Termination_.  This  Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

 

 

(a) by  written agreement of the Buyer and the Seller;

 

 

(b) by  either  the Buyer or the Seller by giving written notice of such
termination to the  other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to  August 31, 2007 so long as the terminating party is not in material
breach  of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

 

(c) by  the  Buyer, by giving five days' written notice of such termination
to the Seller, so  long as the Buyer is not in material breach of its
obligations under this  Agreement, if any condition set forth in Section 6.1
or Section 6.2  shall have become incapable of satisfaction on or prior to
August 31,  2007;

 

 

(d) by  the  Seller, by giving five days' written notice of such termination
to Buyer, so  long as the Seller is not in material breach of its obligations
under this  Agreement, if any condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section
6.3  shall have become incapable of satisfaction on or prior to August 31,
2007;  or

 

 

(e) by  either  party if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to
the tenth Business  Day following the satisfaction of all the conditions set
forth in Article VI  as  a result of any action or inaction by the other
party.

Section  8.2 _Effect  of Termination_.  In the  event of the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1,  this Agreement shall

have any liability to the other party hereto or its  Affiliates, or their
respective Representatives, except for the obligations  of  the parties
hereto contained in this Section 8.2 and in Article IX (and any  related
definitional provisions set forth in Article I), and except that nothing  in
this Section 8.2 shall relieve either party from liability for any  breach of
this Agreement that arose prior to such termination, for which  liability the
provisions of Article VII shall remain in effect in  accordance with the
provisions and limitations of such Article.

be amended or waived if, and only if, such  amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment,  by  all the parties hereto, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom  the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by either party in exercising  any right,

Agreement or  any  Ancillary Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates (but
no such assignment  shall relieve such party of any of its obligations
hereunder). Nothing in this  Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person other  than  the Buyer, the Seller, the Indemnified
Parties and their respective successors,  legal representatives and permitted
assigns, any rights or remedies under or  by  reason of this Agreement.

and the Seller shall be entitled  to designate one arbitrator. The two

arbitrator on or prior to 5:00 P.M. (Hong Kong time) on the twentieth 
Business Day following the date of the appointment of the second arbitrator,

must  be in  writing and state the grounds upon which it is based.

 

 

(c) The  decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the

appeal, review  or  recourse to any state or other judicial authority, in so

an arbitral award rendered  against it under this Agreement may be executed
against its assets in any  jurisdiction.

suit or  proceeding.

with respect  to  the enforceability of the arbitration provisions of this

Dispute to any proper court of competent  jurisdiction for legal suits,
actions or proceedings.
