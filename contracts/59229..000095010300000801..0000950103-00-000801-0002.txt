III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  OF SELLER   As used herein, (i) any
reference to any event, change or effect being "material" with respect to any
Company means an event, change or effect which is material in relation to the
financial condition, properties, business, operations, assets or results of
operations of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and (ii) the term "Material Adverse Effect" on the Companies means (x) a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, business,
operations, assets or results of operations of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) a material adverse effect that would
materially impair the ability of Seller to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or otherwise materially threaten or materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that a
Material Adverse Effect on the Companies shall not include an effect
resulting from (a) any change in Law (as defined in Section 3.5 hereof) or
GAAP (as defined in Section 3.6(b) hereof) or SAP (as defined in Section
3.6(d) hereof) or interpretations thereof that applies to the Companies, the
Company Subsidiaries or any Company or Company Subsidiary, (b) any change or
condition affecting the life insurance industry generally, (c) any change in
general economic, political, regulatory, business or financial market
conditions or (d) any change or condition resulting from the announcement of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;
in the case of (a), (b) and (c), not specific to the Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries or any Company or Company Subsidiary and not having an effect on
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that is
substantially more adverse than the effect on life insurance companies
generally.   Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as set forth in
the Schedules to this Article III (the "Disclosure Schedule") and as
follows:   SECTION 3.1 Organization and Good Standing; Company
Subsidiaries.   (a) Each of Seller, the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization, and
each of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries has all necessary
corporate or similar power and authority to conduct its business as it is now
being conducted and to own or use the properties or assets that it purports
to own or use, and each Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the
properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by
it, requires such qualification or good standing, except for such failures to
be so organized, qualified or in good standing that, individually or in
the    6    aggregate, have not had, do not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies.
Schedule 3.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedule states, with respect to each
Company, its jurisdiction of incorporation and organization and in the case
of each Company engaged in the business of insurance, its jurisdiction of
domicile and "commercial domicile", as applicable.   (b) Seller has made
available or delivered to Buyer a true and complete copy of each Company\'s
and each Company Subsidiary\'s articles or certificate of incorporation and
by-laws (or equivalent documents), each as amended to date (together with the
Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of Seller, collectively, the
"Organizational Documents").   (c) Schedule 3.1(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries (as defined
below) of each Company (each such Subsidiary, other than an Excluded
Subsidiary (as defined in Section 5.9 hereof), hereinafter referred to
individually as a "Company Subsidiary" and, collectively, as the "Company
Subsidiaries") and identifies all Company Subsidiaries engaged in the
issuance of insurance or annuities or otherwise engaged in the business of
reinsurance, including in run-off (each hereinafter referred to individually
as an "Insurance Subsidiary" and collectively as the "Insurance
Subsidiaries"). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" shall
mean with respect to any Person, any corporation or other entity of which
such Person has, directly or indirectly, ownership of securities or other
interests having the power to elect a majority of such corporation\'s or
other entity\'s board of directors (or similar governing body), or otherwise
having the power to direct the business and policies of such corporation or

consolidated group (other than any Company or Company Subsidiary) and less
favorable to any of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries.   SECTION
3.10 Employee Benefits; ERISA.   (a) Schedule 3.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each material, written
profit-sharing, stock option, restricted stock option, deferred compensation,
pension, severance, thrift, savings, incentive, change of control,
employment, retirement, bonus, or equity-based, group life and health
insurance or other employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement or
commitment, which is maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed
to by any Company or any Company Subsidiary on behalf of any current or
former employee, director or consultant of any Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or by Seller on behalf of any Transferred Employee, or pursuant
to which any current or former employee, director or consultant of any
Company or Company Subsidiary or any Transferred Employee is eligible
to receive benefits on account of service with Seller, its Subsidiaries,
any Company or any Company Subsidiary (all of which are hereinafter referred
to as the "Benefit Plans"). Schedule 3.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule
identifies each of the Benefit Plans which constitutes an "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and identifies each of the Benefit Plans
that are sponsored by or are otherwise obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. None of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries has any
formal commitment or intention communicated to employees, to create any
additional Benefit Plan or materially modify or change any existing Benefit
Plan.   (b) With respect to each of the Benefit Plans, Seller has made
available to Buyer true and complete copies of each of the following
documents, if applicable: (i) the plan document (including all amendments
thereto); (ii) trust documents and insurance contracts; (iii) the annual
report filed on Form 5500 for the last two years, if any; (iv) the actuarial
report for the last two years, if any; (v) the most recent summary plan
description, together with each summary of material modifications; (vi) the
most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service;
and (vii) any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the Internal Revenue
Service.   (c) Each Benefit Plan has been operated and administered
substantially in accordance with its terms and with applicable law including,
but not limited to, ERISA and    22    the Code, and all notices,
filings and disclosures required by ERISA or the Code (including notices
under Section 4980B of the Code) have been timely made. Each Benefit Plan
which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service for "TRA" (as defined in Rev. Proc. 93-39), and,
to the knowledge of Seller or the Companies, there are no circumstances that
are likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination
letter. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller or the Companies,
threatened litigation relating to any of the Benefit Plans. None of Seller,
any affiliate of Seller, the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries
has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan that, assuming
the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could
subject any Company or any Company Subsidiary or any Benefit Plan to a Tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA
in an amount which could be material. No action has been taken with respect
to any of the Benefit Plans to either terminate any of such Benefit Plans or
to cause distributions, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business to
participants under such Benefit Plans.   (d) No Benefit Plan is, and no
benefit plan of any entity which is considered one employer with any Company
or any Company Subsidiary under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code is, or has been for the past six years, subject to Title IV of ERISA. No
notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been
required to be filed for any Benefit Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within
the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.   (e) All contributions
required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan have been timely made
when due or have been reflected on the Final Year End Statements.   (f)
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Companies nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligations for retiree
health or life benefits other than coverage mandated by applicable law. The
amounts accrued as of the date hereof by each Company and each
Company Subsidiary in respect of such obligations as of the date hereof are
adequate to satisfy such obligations, and the amounts accrued as of the
Closing Date by each Company and each Company Subsidiary in respect of such
obligations as of the Closing Date will be adequate to satisfy such
obligations as of the Closing Date. There are no restrictions on the rights
of any Company or any Company Subsidiary to amend or terminate any Benefit
Plan without incurring Liability thereunder.   (g) Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.10(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(or will upon termination of employment prior to or after the date hereof)
(i) entitle any employee, director or consultant of any Company or any
Company    23    Subsidiary to severance pay or increase in severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment; (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) or
increase the amount of payment with respect to any compensation due to any
employee, director or consultant; or (iii) meet the definition of a "Change
in Control Event" or otherwise accelerate vesting of any award granted under
the Seller\'s Performance Incentive Compensation Program.   SECTION 3.11

Company or any Company Subsidiary exists or, to the knowledge of Seller and
the Companies, after due inquiry, is threatened.   (b) Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, no Company or Company Subsidiary
has been a party to, or is bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or
other similar labor Contract, nor is any collective bargaining agreement or
other similar labor Contract currently being negotiated, nor, to the
knowledge of Seller and the Companies, are there any activities or
proceedings of any labor union or labor organization to organize any of the
employees of any Company or any Company Subsidiary.   (c) To the knowledge
of the Seller and the Companies, as of the date of this Agreement, none of
the officers of Liberty Life or Liberty Services specified on Schedule 3.11
has advised Seller or any Company of his or her intention to terminate his or
her employment.   SECTION 3.12 Compliance with Laws; Governmental

material respects, with  each Law that is or was at the time thereof

failure on the part of  Seller, with respect to its operation of the
Companies, or any Company or  any Company Subsidiary to comply with, any
Law;    24    except in each case for such failures to comply or

have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies.   (b) Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, Seller, with respect to its
operation of the Companies, and each Company and each Company Subsidiary
holds and maintains in full force and effect all Governmental Authorizations

as it is currently conducted. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule:   (i) no event has occurred or circumstance exists that
(with or  without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both) has
resulted or  would result in the revocation, withdrawal, suspension,
cancellation, or  termination of, or any limitation on the ability of any
Company or Company  Subsidiary to do business under, any such Governmental
Authorization; and   (ii) none of the Seller, with respect to its operation
of the  Companies, the Companies nor any Company Subsidiary has received, at
any  time since January 1, 1997, any notice or other communication (whether

suspension, cancellation, termination of, or modification to  any
Governmental Authorization;  except for those, the absence of which,

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Companies.   (c) Seller and the Companies have made available for inspection
by Buyer all Filings made by Seller, with respect to its operation of the
Companies, and by each Company and each Company Subsidiary, with any
Governmental Entity since January 1, 1997. No deficiencies have been asserted

reported as being written in the Statutory Statements, except in any such
case where the failure to be so licensed or authorized, individually or in

expected to have a Material Adverse    25    Effect on the Companies.
Each Company and Company Subsidiary is, where required, duly licensed or
authorized and appointed as a third party administrator, insurance agency,
managing general agency, or similar service provider, in its jurisdiction of
incorporation and in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so
licensed or authorized except in any case where the failure to be so
licensed, authorized or appointed, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had, does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Companies. Each Company and each Company Subsidiary
and, to the knowledge of Seller or the Companies, its Producers, have
marketed, serviced, administered, sold and issued insurance products

Companies. To the knowledge of Seller and the Companies, no proceeding or
customer complaint has been filed with the insurance regulatory authorities
with respect to possible violations of any applicable Laws which would
reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, failure to renew,
limitation, fine, suspension or restriction of any such Governmental

Liberty Life or any Insurance Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of
Seller and the Companies, threatened against Liberty Life or any Insurance
Subsidiary, by any state insurance guaranty association in connection with
such association\'s fund relating to insolvent insurers, and none of the
Companies nor any Insurance Subsidiary has received notice of any such claim
or assessment, except such claims or assessments that, if
determined adversely, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies.   (e) No
Company or Company Subsidiary conducts activities that would require it to
register as a broker or dealer, as such terms are defined in Section 3(a) of

party client of any Investment Adviser Subsidiary has asserted, or threatened
to assert, any claim against such Investment Adviser Subsidiary or the
Companies relating to the investment advisory services performed for such

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Companies.    27     (g) No Company or Company Subsidiary is an
"investment company" or an adviser to an "investment company" as that term is
defined under the Investment Company Act.   (h) Other than in respect of

the extent permitted by Subsection 5.2(b), (A) discuss  with, (B) negotiate
with, (C) provide any confidential information or data  to, or (D) consider

Person (other than Buyer) relating to any transaction directly or indirectly

Business, five (5) percent or more of the consolidated assets of
the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, or any of the Shares or any
shares of stock of the Company Subsidiaries, the Transferred Property or the
Seller Intellectual Property, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving Seller, any Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or the acquisition of twenty-five (25) percent or more of
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Seller (any such
inquiry, proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition
Proposal"); provided that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Seller
from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, each Company and each Company Subsidiary to, and each shall use
its reasonable best efforts to, cause each Related Person and each of their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received
by, any such information is requested from, or any such negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with or about any
Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly request each Person which has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring any Company or any Company Subsidiary or the
Business or assets (other than in the Ordinary Course of Business) of any
Company or any Company Subsidiary to return all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any Company or any
Company Subsidiary.   (b) At any time prior to the time its shareholders
shall have voted to approve this Agreement, if Seller is not otherwise in
violation of Section 5.22 hereof, of the first sentence of Section 5.23(a)
hereof and of this Section 5.2, Seller may:   (i) if it receives an
unsolicited bona fide written proposal from a  third party regarding an
Acquisition Proposal and the board of directors  of Seller, after
consultation with its financial adviser and outside  counsel, determines that
pursuing such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably  likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined below), engage in the  activities specified in
Subsection 5.2(a)(ii)(A) and (D), if, in the  opinion of the outside counsel
to Seller, such action is required for the  board of directors of Seller to
comply with its fiduciary duties under  applicable Law for the purpose of
determining whether such Acquisition  Proposal is a Superior Proposal,   
45     (ii) further engage in the activities specified in Subsection 
5.2(a)(ii)(C) if Seller has received from such third party an executed 
confidentiality agreement with confidentiality terms at least as stringent 
as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 
10.2 hereof), and if in the opinion of outside counsel to Seller, such 
action is required for the board of directors of Seller to comply with its 
fiduciary duties under applicable Law for the purpose of determining  whether
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and   (iii) further engage
in the activities specified in Section  5.2(a)(ii)(B) regarding such an
unsolicited bona fide written proposal  that its board of directors has
determined is a Superior Proposal, if, in  the opinion of outside counsel to
Seller, such action is required for the  board of directors of Seller to
comply with its fiduciary duties under  applicable Law and Seller has
received from such third party an executed  confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality terms at least as stringent  as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement.   Seller will keep Buyer fully and currently
informed of the status and details of any such unsolicited bona fide written
proposal or Superior Proposal and any related discussions or, in the case of
a Superior Proposal, negotiations. A "Superior Proposal" is a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of Seller determines in good
faith after reasonable investigation, including receiving the opinion of its
financial advisor and consulting with outside legal counsel to Seller and
taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
including any break-up fees or similar devices, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation (i) is more favorable and provides
greater value to all of Seller\'s shareholders than this Agreement and the
Acquisition, taken as a whole, and (ii) is reasonably capable of being, and
is reasonably likely to be, consummated.   (c) Seller hereby agrees that
(i) it shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to United Family Life
Insurance Company ("UFL") pursuant to Section 13.02(b) of the Administrative
Services Agreement, dated November 13, 1997, between UFL, Fortis, Inc., the
Seller and Liberty Services (as amended, the "Fortis Agreement"), no more
than 20 days prior to the Closing, a notice of change of control of Liberty
Services; (ii) it shall not deliver and shall cause the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries not to deliver, any notice pursuant to Section 13.02(c)
of the Fortis Agreement, offering a right of first refusal to UFL to acquire
the issued and outstanding shares of Liberty Services; and (iii) it shall not
deliver any notices arising out of, resulting from, relating to, or in
connection with this Agreement (including the notice referred to in clause
(i) above) to UFL without the prior written approval of Buyer, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld.   SECTION 5.3 Access. Between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including each Company and each Company Subsidiary and each of
their respective Representatives, to, (i) afford Buyer    46    and
its Representatives reasonable access, at all reasonable times during normal
business hours, to each Company and each Company Subsidiary\'s
personnel, premises, properties, Contracts, books and records, and other
documents and data, (ii) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with copies of
all such Contracts, books and records, and other documents and data as have
not previously been furnished to Buyer and as Buyer may reasonably request,
(iii) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with such additional
financial, operating, and other data and information as Buyer may reasonably
request, but only to the extent such data or information exists or can be
generated or produced without disproportionate expense, and (iv) authorize
the Companies\' independent certified public accountants to permit Buyer and
its independent actuaries, auditors, tax consultants and certified public
accountants to examine all accounting records and working papers pertaining
to the Financial Statements and Statutory Statements. No investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by Seller. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.3 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Seller, the Companies or the
Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not have
access to personnel records of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries
relating to medical histories or other information the disclosure of which
would subject Seller, any Company or any Company Subsidiary to liability. The
foregoing shall not require Seller or any Company to permit any inspection,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of Seller
would reasonably be expected to result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if Seller or such Company, as the case may be, shall have
used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 5.3 shall be directed to an executive officer of Seller or any
Company or such other Persons as may be designated by Seller.   SECTION 5.4
Required Approvals.   (a) Each party hereto hereby agrees to cooperate with
the other party and use its reasonable best efforts promptly to prepare and
file all necessary Filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all necessary Consents of all third parties and Governmental

Governmental Entities, advisable, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements. Buyer shall have the right to review
in advance, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, any Filing made by Seller or any Company or Company Subsidiary
with, or other written materials submitted by Seller or any Company or
Company Subsidiary to, any third party or Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. Buyer will consult with Seller about the status of any Consents
required to be obtained by Buyer from any third party or Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer
shall, and covenants and agrees to, promptly notify Seller of all filings,
submissions and correspondence made to or received from any

extent relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary
Agreements). Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and covenants and agrees to
cause each Company and each Company Subsidiary to, provide promptly to Buyer
copies of all filings, submissions and correspondence made to or received
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, and all other material filings,
submissions and correspondence made to or received from any Governmental
Entity. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Buyer and Seller shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Buyer and Seller agree that
they will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.   (b) Without limiting the generality of Section
5.4(a), Buyer agrees to furnish Seller with true and accurate information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.23 hereof) or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.   (c) Without limiting the generality of Section
5.4(a), Seller agrees to furnish Buyer with true and accurate information

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

obligations thereunder to be  satisfied concurrently with the Closing,   
48     and to provide to Buyer documentation in a form reasonably
satisfactory to  Buyer so attesting; and   (ii) Buyer shall reimburse

counterparties of Contracts when such payments  are necessary to obtain the
Consent of such counterparty to the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 5.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, each of the parties hereto shall use their

by way of informing such clients of such subsidiary\'s intention to continue

condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of Seller\'s
representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or if, to
the knowledge of Seller and the Companies, there is the occurrence after the

representation or warranty had such representation or warranty been made as
of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition, other than
representations made as of a specified time. To the knowledge of Seller and
the Companies, should any such fact or condition require any change in the

Company or Company Subsidiary for the purpose of competing with any Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or for the purpose of damaging any Company or any
Company Subsidiary in any way, (ii) cause or encourage any customer of
Liberty Services to terminate, modify or fail to renew any third party

greater than five (5) percent of the equity interest in any company engaged
in any business in the Restricted Area (as defined in Section 5.13(b)
hereof), which competes with the Business; provided that the restrictions of
clause (iv) shall not apply to any company which derives less than ten (10)
percent of its aggregate revenues from engaging in business in the Restricted
Area which competes with the Business; and provided further that any Person
that is not currently a Related Person of Seller that acquires an interest in
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the Closing Date shall not be
subject to clauses (iii) or (iv) of this Section 5.13(a) (it being understood
that such restrictions shall continue to apply to Seller and
its Subsidiaries). Seller specifically agrees that this covenant is an
integral part of the inducement of Buyer to purchase the Shares and that
Buyer (or its successors or assigns) shall be entitled to injunctive relief
in addition to all other legal and equitable rights and remedies available to
it in connection with any breach by Seller of any provision of this Section
5.13 and that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no right, power or remedy
conferred upon or reserved or    51    exercised by Buyer in this
Section 5.13 is intended to be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy,
each and every one of which (now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, by
statute or otherwise) shall be cumulative and concurrent. Each of Seller and
Buyer agrees that in the event that either the length of time or Restricted
Area set forth herein is deemed too restrictive by any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction, the covenants and agreements in this Section 5.13
shall be enforceable for such time and within such geographical area as such
Governmental Entity may deem reasonable or acceptable under the
circumstances.   (b) Restricted Area. The covenants contained in Section
5.13(a) hereof shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for
each county or state of the United States of America and one for each country
in which any Company or any Company Subsidiary conducted business on or prior
to the Closing Date (together, the "Restricted Area").   (c) Non-
Solicitation. Seller hereby covenants and agrees that from the date hereof
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries or Related Persons shall, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, solicit
for employment (it being understood that general employment advertisements in
media of wide distribution, including the Internet and participation in job
fairs not directed to employees of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries,
shall not be a violation of this Section 5.13(c)), or, until after the first
anniversary of the date of such individual\'s termination of employment or
service, hire any current employee or Producer of any Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Transferred Employees.   (d) For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Related Person" shall mean, with respect to any Person,
(i) any Person which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with, such Person, (ii) each Person that serves as a
director, officer, partner, executor, or trustee of such Person (or in any
other similar capacity), (iii) any Person with respect to which such Person
serves as a general partner or trustee (or in any other similar capacity),
and (iv) any Person that has direct or indirect beneficial ownership (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of voting securities or other
voting interests representing at least 20 percent of the outstanding voting
power or equity securities or other equity interests representing at least 20
percent of the outstanding equity interests (a "Material Interest") in such
Person and (v) any Person in which such Person holds a Material Interest.  
SECTION 5.14 Employee and Employee Benefit Matters.   (a) Buyer shall, or
shall cause each Company and each Company Subsidiary to, during the period
commencing at the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
provide to their active and former employees employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements (other than stock option or other plans
involving the    52    potential issuance of securities) which in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to those provided under the applicable
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements of each Company
and each Company Subsidiary in effect as of the Closing; provided, however,
that the requirements of this sentence shall not apply to employees who are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement; provided, further, that no
specific plans, programs, policies or arrangements shall be required to be
provided, except as required by applicable Law. Employees of each Company and
each Company Subsidiary shall be given credit for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under each employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement (and
for purposes of benefit accrual under each vacation or severance benefit
plan, program or arrangement) of Buyer or any of its Related Persons in which
the employees are eligible to participate for all service with any Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any predecessor employer (if such credit was given
by Seller).   (b) If employees of any Company or any Company Subsidiary
become eligible to participate in the year in which the Closing occurs in a
medical, dental or health plan of Buyer or its Related Persons, Buyer shall
cause such plan to (i) waive any pre- existing condition limitations for
conditions covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of
any Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Company Welfare Plans") to the
same extent such pre-existing condition was waived under the Company Welfare
Plans and (ii) honor any deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the employees and their beneficiaries under the Company Welfare Plans during
the portion of the plan year preceding the Closing. If employees of any
Company or any Company Subsidiary become eligible to participate in the year
in which the Closing occurs in a group term life insurance plan maintained by
Buyer or its Related Persons, Buyer shall cause such plan to waive any
medical certification for such employees up to the amount of coverage the
employees had elected under the life insurance plan of any Company or any
Company Subsidiary (but subject to any limits on the maximum amount of
coverage under Buyer\'s life insurance plan).   (c) On the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause each employee set forth on Schedule 5.14 (each, a
"Transferred Employee") to cease to be an employee of Seller and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each Transferred Employee to become an
employee, on substantially the same terms and conditions as he or she is
currently employed by Seller, of the Company listed on Schedule 5.14 with
respect to such Transferred Employee (the "Employee Transfer"), it being
understood that Seller shall not be required to offer any monetary inducement
to such employees to so cause such employees to become employees of a
Company. Seller shall retain responsibility for (i) all claims incurred
with respect to Transferred Employees and (ii) any benefit accrued under a
Benefit Plan, or any other obligation of Seller arising, in each case, with
respect to Transferred Employees, in each case (i) and (ii) for claims
incurred, benefits accrued or obligations arising for the period prior to the
Closing Date; it being understood that Seller may satisfy such liability by
transferring to Liberty Life assets equal in market value to the Liabilities
related to the Transferred Employees. For purposes of this Section 5.14(c), a
claim shall be deemed to be    53    incurred with respect to any
employee benefit welfare plan, when the medical or other service giving rise
to the claim is performed, except that disability claims shall be deemed to
have been incurred on the date the employee becomes disabled.   (d) As soon
as practicable following the date hereof, Seller shall (i) change the
sponsorship of any Benefit Plans designated by Buyer, including The Liberty
Corporation Retirement and Savings Plan, as amended and restated (the "401(k)
Plan"), so that such plans become sponsored by the Company designated by
Buyer not later than the Closing and so that Seller and its
remaining affiliates shall cease to be participating employers in any such
plan effective as of the Closing; (ii) amend the 401(k) Plan so as to
preclude any new contributions to or investments in the Seller stock fund
following the Closing (the "Plan Transfer"); (iii) develop with Buyer
employee communications regarding such changes; and (iv) transfer to the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries, all payroll and personnel records
relating to current and former employees of each Company and Company
Subsidiary, including Transferred Employees, and such related information as
may be reasonably required by Buyer.   (e) All outstanding stock options
held by employees of any Company and any Company Subsidiary and the
Transferred Employees will become fully exercisable as of the Closing and all
other equity based awards of such Persons will fully vest, and Seller shall
take such action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.   SECTION
5.15 Intercompany Agreements and Accounts. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or set forth in Schedule 5.15 of the Disclosure Schedule,
Seller shall take all actions necessary to terminate prior to or concurrent
with the Closing all Intercompany Agreements. From and after the date hereof,
all Seller Parties shall conduct all transactions with any Company or any
Company Subsidiary only in the Ordinary Course of Business. At least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
a preliminary statement setting out in reasonable detail the calculation of
all accounts (including all amounts owed or owing) between any Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Seller or any Seller Party, on
the other hand, as of the Closing and, to the extent reasonably requested by
Buyer, provide Buyer with supporting documentation to verify the
underlying intercompany accounts and transactions. At the Closing Seller
shall deliver a final statement of the calculation of such accounts
determined as of the Closing Date. Subject to Section 5.25, the net amount of
such intercompany accounts as shown on such final statement shall be paid in
full by cash payment from Seller to one or more of the Companies or from one
or more of the Companies to Seller, as the case may be, prior to or
concurrent with the Closing.   SECTION 5.16 Additional Financial
Statements. As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available,
Seller or a Company shall furnish to Buyer any Financial Statements or
Statutory Statements with respect to any period ending subsequent to March
31, 2000 and more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date.   
54     SECTION 5.17 Ancillary Agreements.   (a) Seller shall, and shall
cause each Company and each Company Subsidiary and other relevant Seller
Subsidiaries, as appropriate, to, execute and deliver (at the Closing) the
Ancillary Agreements to be executed and delivered at the Closing by Seller
and by such Subsidiary of Seller and shall perform, and cause its
Subsidiaries to perform, their respective obligations under each
Ancillary Agreement.   (b) Buyer shall execute and deliver (at the Closing)
the Ancillary Agreements to be executed and delivered by it at the Closing
and shall perform, and cause its Subsidiaries to perform, its obligations
under each Ancillary Agreement.   (c) The parties hereto agree to work
together from the date hereof through the Closing Date to reach agreement on
the terms and conditions of a transitional services agreement (the "Services
Agreement") pursuant to which Buyer shall cause the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries to provide to the Seller and its Subsidiaries, and Seller and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and Company Subsidiaries) shall
provide to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, certain transitional
services for the period from and after the Closing Date to December 31,
2001.   SECTION 5.18 Retention of Records.   (a) Seller may retain (i) one
copy of the materials included in the data room organized by Seller in
connection with the Acquisition, together with a copy of all documents
referred to in such materials, (ii) all internal correspondence and

from others in connection with the Acquisition, (iii) a copy of all
consolidating and consolidated financial information and all other accounting
records prepared or used in connection with the preparation of the Financial

relating to any action or suit involving both (x) a Company or Company
Subsidiary and (y) the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries other than
the Companies and Company Subsidiaries. Seller shall deliver to Buyer all
other books and records relating to each Company and each Company Subsidiary
and in its possession or control, and such books and records shall include
all actuarial investigations, studies, audits, tests, reviews or other
analyses conducted by, or relating to, Liberty Life, Liberty Bermuda or any
Insurance Subsidiary, if any, in its possession or control.   (b)
Notwithstanding this Section 5.18, the parties\' agreement with respect to
books, records and files relating to Taxes is set forth in Section
7.4(b) hereof.   SECTION 5.19 Liberty Mark. (a) Seller agrees that, from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, it will not
(without the prior written consent of Buyer):    55     (i) Enter
into, terminate or make any adverse change in any Contract  relating to the
use of the Liberty mark as used in the Business; or   (ii) Settle or
authorize, commit or enter into any agreement to  settle any claim, action or
proceeding involving any restrictions with  respect to the use of the Liberty
mark.   (b) Seller agrees that it will, and will cause its affiliates to,
use its reasonable best efforts, but only to the extent consistent with
Seller\'s past practices with respect to the Liberty mark, or if not
consistent with Seller\'s past practices, then, upon request and at the
expense of Buyer (so long as such steps do not adversely affect the use of
the Liberty mark by the Seller other than in the Business), take all steps
necessary to protect the value of the Liberty mark prior to the Closing Date,
including maintaining all registrations relating to the Liberty mark,
prosecution of all pending applications for trademark or service mark
registration relating to the Liberty mark, opposing or continuing to oppose
all third party applications for registration of confusingly similar
trademarks or service marks and pursuing actions against all third parties
that are infringing, misappropriating or diluting the Liberty mark, provided
that Seller will not be required to register any unregistered trademarks or
trade names unless such application to register is upon request and at the
expense of Buyer and so long as such registration would not adversely affect
the use of the Liberty mark by the Seller other than in the Business.  
SECTION 5.20 Forbearances of Seller and Buyer. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall
knowingly take any action intended or reasonably likely to (i) result in any

set forth in Section 6.1 not being satisfied, (iii) materially breach any of
its covenants under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (iv)

Environmental Testing. Seller shall permit and assist Buyer in the
performance of any environmental surveys, sampling and assessments of the
Real Property and of the soil from the Real Property it deems appropriate for

pay all costs associated with such surveys, sampling and assessments.  
SECTION 5.22 Shareholder Approval.    56     (a) Seller shall take, in
accordance with South Carolina Law and the Restated Articles of Incorporation
and By-Laws of Seller, all action necessary to convene an appropriate meeting

Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by shareholders of

Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including any adjournment or

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.22, the board
of directors of Seller (i) shall at all times recommend approval of

that is a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of Seller shall be
excused from its obligations under clauses (i) to (iii) of this Subsection
5.22(b) and shall be permitted to withdraw, modify or qualify its
recommendation to its shareholders if, but only if, (w) in the opinion
of Seller\'s outside counsel, such withdrawal, modification or qualification
is required in order for the board of directors of Seller to comply with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) Seller has given Buyer five
(5) Business Days\' prior notice of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal
and Seller\'s board of directors has considered in good faith and consistent
with its fiduciary duties any proposed changes to this Agreement (if any)

57     (b) Each of Buyer and Seller agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it

therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in the
Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto. Each of Buyer and

and Seller shall take the necessary steps to amend or supplement the Proxy

and Company Subsidiaries to the same extent as currently insured.   (b)
Seller shall have provided written notice to all insurance
companies providing insurance coverage as specified in Subsection (a) above

Taxes and Related Matters.   (a) Seller shall be liable for and shall
indemnify Buyer and each Buyer Indemnified Person (as defined in Section 9.2
hereof) for all Taxes (including, without limitation, any obligation to
contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined or
unitary basis with respect to a group of corporations that includes or
included any Company or any Company Subsidiary and Taxes resulting from any
Company or any Company Subsidiary ceasing to be a member of any affiliated,
combined or consolidated group of which such Company or such Company
Subsidiary is now a member or attributable to the election to be made under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any state, local or foreign law
equivalents) (i) imposed on any Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
for which any Company or any Company Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, for
any Pre- Closing Tax Period, including without limitation, any Taxes
triggered by a dividend of shares pursuant to Section 5.9 of this Agreement,
the dividends contemplated by Section 3.7(b) of this Agreement or pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and including any Taxes on Phase III income
as a result of an election made under Section 338), provided that with
respect to Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods not reported on a consolidated,
combined or unitary basis with Seller, Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify    64    Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Persons only to the
extent such Taxes are in excess of the respective Liability for such Taxes as
set forth in the Financial Statements of the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, (ii) imposed with respect to any
corporation (other than any Company or any Company Subsidiary) that was a
member of an affiliated, combined or consolidated group of which any Company
or any Company Subsidiary was a member prior to the Closing Date, for any
taxable year, or (iii) attributable to Seller\'s breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in Section 3.9 hereof or this
Article VII of this Agreement, provided that Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Persons for matters covered by the
indemnity provisions of Section 7.11 hereof only to the extent provided in
and pursuant to Section 7.11 hereof. Seller shall be entitled to any refund
of Taxes of any Company or any Company Subsidiary (net of Taxes payable by
such Company or such Company Subsidiary thereon) received in respect of any
Pre-Closing Tax Period except to the extent such refund (i) relates to Taxes
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods not reported on a consolidated, combined or
unitary basis with Seller, and (ii) is not in excess of the respective Tax
Liability set forth on the Financial Statements provided pursuant to Section
3.6 hereof.   (b) Buyer shall be liable for and shall indemnify Seller for
all Taxes of any Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than Taxes for
which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 7.1(a) hereof) for any Post-
Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of any
Company or any Company Subsidiary received in respect of any Post-Closing Tax
Period except to the extent such refund relates solely to Taxes for which
Seller has indemnified Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Party.   (c) Whenever
it is necessary for purposes of this Section 7.1 to determine the liability
for Taxes of any Company or any Company Subsidiary for a taxable year or
period that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date,
the determination shall be made by assuming that such Company or such
Company Subsidiary had a taxable year or period which ended at the close of
business on the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as the deduction for
depreciation) shall be apportioned on a time basis.   (d) Any payment by
Buyer to Seller, or by Seller to Buyer, under this Agreement (other than
interest payments) shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price paid to or received by such party, as the case may be.   (e)
Buyer shall be liable for all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and similar taxes arising from the Acquisition and
the transactions contemplated herein, other than transfer taxes arising from
the transfer of the Real Property pursuant to Section 5.25 of this
Agreement.    65     (f) The indemnities provided in this Section 7.1
shall continue until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
and are not subject to any limitations on time for notice of claim set forth
in Article IX.   SECTION 7.2 Tax Returns and Reports.   (a) Seller shall
prepare and file or cause to be filed (i) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed on or before the Closing Date with respect to each Company and
each Company Subsidiary for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, and (ii) all income Tax Returns that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date on a combined or consolidated basis with Seller, with respect to
each Company and each Company Subsidiary for taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any
such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past
practice.   (b) Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to each Company and
each Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date other than income Tax Returns
described in Section 7.2(a) hereof and shall remit any Taxes due in respect
of such Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax Return that covers a taxable
year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to Seller at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date (including applicable extensions) for the filing
thereof, and Seller shall have the right to approve (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) such Tax Return to the extent that it
relates to the portion of the taxable year or period ending on the Closing
Date. Seller shall pay Buyer the amount of any Taxes for which Seller is
liable pursuant to Section 7.1(a) hereof but which are payable with Tax
Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) within ten (10)
days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns.   (c) With
respect to the taxable year of each Company and each Company Subsidiary
ending on December 31, 1999 and any subsequent taxable year of any Company or
any Company Subsidiary ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
promptly cause the Companies to prepare and provide to Seller a package of
tax information materials (the "Tax Package"), which shall be completed
in accordance with past practice including past practice as to providing
the information, schedules and work papers and as to the method of
computation of separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income of
each Company and each Company Subsidiary.   (d) Nothing in this Section 7.2
shall reduce Seller\'s obligations under Section 7.1(a) hereof.   
66     SECTION 7.3 Contest Provisions.   (a) Buyer shall promptly (and
in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) notify Seller in writing upon
receipt by Buyer, any of its affiliates or any Company or any Company
Subsidiary of notice of any pending or threatened Federal, state, local or
foreign audits or assessments relating to Taxes which may affect the Tax
liabilities of any Company or any Company Subsidiary for which Seller would
be required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(a) hereof; provided,
however, that no failure or delay in giving any such notice shall relieve
Seller of its obligations under this Agreement. Seller shall have the sole
right to represent the Companies\' interests in any audit or administrative
or court proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided
that with respect to any Company or Company Subsidiary for which Buyer and
Seller have not made a valid election under Code Section 338(h)(10),
Buyer shall be given notice of, and have the right to monitor all proceedings
and to review in advance and comment on all submissions made by Seller in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller agrees not to
take any position or enter into any agreement, settlement or arrangement
related to the treatment under the Code of any insurance or annuity policies,
plans, or contracts, any financial products and any similar related policies,
contracts, plans or products, whether individual, group or otherwise issued,
entered into or sold by Liberty Life, Liberty Bermuda or any Insurance
Subsidiary that is inconsistent with the intended treatment under the Code of
such polices, plans, contracts or products or take any other action that
would affect their intended treatment under the Code without the consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   (b) Seller shall
be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of any claim for
Taxes for a year or period ending after the Closing Date which may be the
subject of indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(a) hereof and,
with the written consent of Buyer, and at its sole expense, may assume the
entire defense of such claim. None of Buyer, the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries may agree to settle any claim for Taxes for the portion of the
year or period ending on the Closing Date which may be the subject of
indemnification by Seller under Section 7.1(b) hereof without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.   SECTION 7.4 Cooperation; Records.   (a) After the Closing
Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall:   (i) assist (and cause their
respective affiliates to assist) the  other party as necessary in preparing
any Tax Returns which such other  party is responsible for preparing and
filing in accordance with Section  7.2 hereof;    67     (ii)
cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with  taxing
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Company or any  Company
Subsidiary and in administering this Agreement;   (iii) make available to
the other party and to any taxing authority  as reasonably requested all
books and records, documents, financial,  operating and accounting data and
other information relating to Taxes of  each Company and each Company
Subsidiary;   (iv) provide timely notice to the other party in writing of
any  pending or threatened audits or assessments of any Company or any
Company  Subsidiary for taxable periods for which the other party may have
a  liability under this Article VII;   (v) furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondence  received from any taxing authority in
connection with any Tax audit or  information request with respect to any
such taxable period; and   (vi) execute and deliver such powers of attorney
and other documents  as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Article
VII.   (b) Each of Seller, Buyer and its Subsidiaries, the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries shall retain or cause to be retained all Tax
Returns, schedules, workpapers, and all material books and records or other
documents relating thereto, until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any waivers or extensions thereof) for the taxable
years to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate or as otherwise
required by any record retention agreement with any taxing authority that
relates to any Company or any Company Subsidiary. Prior to transferring,
discarding or destroying any such Tax Returns, records or other documents
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller or Buyer as the case may be
shall notify the other and, if the other so requests, provide the other with
the opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns, records or documents
solely at the other\'s expense.   SECTION 7.5 Disputes. If Seller and Buyer
cannot agree on any calculation required to be made under this Article VII
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, such calculation shall be made by
an independent public accounting firm of national standing selected by Seller
and reasonably acceptable to Buyer. The decision of such firm shall be final
and binding, and the fees and expenses charged or incurred by it in
connection with such calculation shall be shared equally by Seller and
Buyer.    68     SECTION 7.6 Section 338(h)(10) Election.   (a) At
the request of Buyer, Seller shall make a joint election with Buyer under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and under any similar provisions of state,
local or foreign law) with respect to the purchase of the Shares of those
Companies and Company Subsidiaries for which Buyer wishes to make such
an election. Seller represents that its sale of the Shares is eligible for,
and Buyer represents that it is qualified to make, such election. If the
election will be made, Seller and Buyer shall, on the Closing Date (or such
later date as may be determined by Buyer), exchange completed and executed
copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023-A, required schedules thereto,
and any similar state, local or foreign forms. If any changes are required in
these forms as a result of information that is first available after the
Closing Date, the parties will promptly agree on such changes.   (b) If an
election will be made under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, Buyer shall, as
promptly as practical following the Closing Date, prepare a schedule showing
the allocation of the purchase price among the assets of each of the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries that are deemed to have been
acquired pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or any corresponding
election under state, local or foreign law), after giving effect to the
allocations described in Section 7.7 below. Buyer shall provide Seller with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the allocation schedule.
Such allocation shall be made in accordance with all relevant provisions of
the Code and shall be subject to the consent of Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller and Buyer shall use the asset values
determined from such allocation for purposes of all reports and returns with
respect to Taxes, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 or any
equivalent statement.   SECTION 7.7 Allocation. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among the Shares and the Seller Intellectual Property, as specified
by Buyer and agreed to by Seller and attached hereto as Schedule 7.7. Seller
and Buyer shall use such allocation (after giving effect to the allocations
under Section 7.6(b)) for purposes of all reports and returns with respect to
Taxes.   SECTION 7.8 Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements.   (a) Any
tax allocation or sharing agreement or arrangement, whether or not written,
that may have been entered into by Seller or any member of Seller\'s Group
and any of the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries shall be terminated as
to the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and
no payments which are owed by or to any of the Companies or the
Company Subsidiaries pursuant thereto shall be made thereunder.   (b) From
the date hereof until Closing, the Companies shall pay to Seller their share
of any quarterly estimated income Taxes related to any federal, state or
local    69    income Tax Liabilities reported on a consolidated,
combined or unitary basis with Seller with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods. The amount of such share of estimated taxes shall be calculated on a
basis that is consistent with past practice and the principles of the Tax
Liability Allocation Agreement, provided that such estimate shall not take
into account the effects of any Section 338(h)(10) election (or any similar
provision of state or local law and including any Taxes on Phase III income
as a result of an election under Section 338) made with respect to any of the
Companies or Company Subsidiaries, any dividend of shares pursuant to Section
5.9 of this Agreement, or the dividends contemplated by Section 3.7(b) of
this Agreement or the sale of any assets for the purpose of funding the
Special Dividend contemplated by Section 3.7(b) (other than in the Ordinary
Course of Business). With respect to any Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods beginning no earlier than January 1, 1999 that are to be filed by
Seller prior to the Closing Date, the Companies and Company Subsidiaries
shall pay to Seller the Tax Sharing Amount for such period. Within ten (10)
Business Days after filing a final income Tax Return for the Pre-Closing
Period, Seller shall provide Buyer with its calculation of the Companies\'
and Company Subsidiaries\' Tax Sharing Amount and all documentation
reasonably necessary for Buyer to confirm such calculations. With respect to
Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are to be filed by Seller after
the Closing Date, within ten (10) Business Days after filing a final income
Tax Return for the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall provide Buyer with its
calculation of the Companies\' and Company Subsidiaries\' Tax Sharing Amount
and all documentation reasonably necessary for Buyer to confirm
such calculations. If Buyer disagrees with Seller\'s calculation, it must so
notify Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days of receiving all of the
required documentation. If Buyer so notifies Seller, Buyer and Seller shall
promptly choose an independent accounting firm, reasonably acceptable to both
parties, to calculate the Tax Sharing Amount. The cost of such services shall
be allocated equally between the parties. Each of Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate with and provide all necessary information to the accounting firm
and the determination of the accounting firm shall be final and binding on
the parties. If Buyer does not notify Seller of its disagreement within the
prescribed time, Seller\'s determination shall be final and binding on Buyer.
If the total amount paid for estimated Taxes by the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries exceeds the Tax Sharing Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer the
difference between the amount paid for estimated Taxes and the Tax Sharing
Amount within five (5) business days of when a determination has become
final. If the total amount paid for estimated Taxes is less than the Tax
Sharing Amount, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the difference
between the amount paid for estimated Taxes and the Tax Sharing Amount within
five (5) business days of when a determination has become final.   SECTION
7.9 Section 1445. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an affidavit
of Seller, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, stating
under penalties of perjury the Seller\'s U.S. taxpayer identification number
and that Seller is not a foreign person within the meaning of Section
1445(b)(2) of the Code.    70     SECTION 7.10 Survival of
Obligations. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.1(f) the obligations
of the parties set forth in this Article VII shall be unconditional and
absolute and shall remain in effect until all applicable statutes of
limitations have expired. The limitations contained in Section 9.4 shall not
apply to any indemnification obligations under Section 7.1 or 7.11.  
SECTION 7.11 Indemnification for Sections 7702, 7702A, 72, 101(f) and 817(h)
Liability. Seller shall indemnify Buyer and each Buyer Indemnified Person
from, against and in respect of one half of all costs arising from or
in connection with (i) any life insurance Contract or annuity Contract
issued, entered into, reinsured, or sold by Liberty Life, Liberty Bermuda or
any Insurance Subsidiary failing, at any time prior to Closing, to qualify as
a life insurance contract or annuity contract as applicable under the federal
Tax laws including, without limitation, under Sections 72, 101(f), 817(h) and
7702 of the Code and their underlying regulations, and (ii) any life
insurance Contract issued, entered into, reinsured, or sold by Liberty Life,
Liberty Bermuda or any Insurance Subsidiary qualifying at any time prior to
Closing as a modified endowment contract within the meaning of 7702A of the
Code (each event described in clause (i) or (ii) hereinafter referred to as a
"Contract Failure"). For purposes of this Section 7.11 costs arising from or
in connection with a Contract Failure include, without limitation, all
amounts paid or incurred to remedy any such Contract Failure including: (a)
all amounts paid pursuant to any closing agreements entered into with the
Internal Revenue Service (or any other taxing authority) with respect to any
Contract Failure as well as all related expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses of counsel), (b) to the extent that Buyer is unable or
unwilling to enter into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service
(or any other taxing authority) that eliminates the Tax liability of its
policyholders arising from such Contract Failure, all amounts paid to
policyholders to reimburse them for their Tax liability arising from such
Contract Failure as well as all expenses incurred to arrange and administer
such payments (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of counsel) and
(c) the costs of any other reasonable method by which Buyer may choose to
compensate such policyholders for Taxes arising from a Contract Failure,
provided that (i) Seller shall only be obligated to indemnify Buyer and the
Buyer Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.11 to the extent that such
costs exceed the amount set forth in Schedule 7.11 of the Disclosure Schedule
and (ii) Seller\'s maximum liability under this Section 7.11 shall be limited
to $2,500,000. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the indemnity provided
in this Section 7.11 shall be the sole remedy of the Buyer and the Buyer
Indemnified Persons for any costs arising from or in connection with a
Contract Failure, including without limitation, any damages arising from or
in connection with the breach of any of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.20(c)(ii), (iii), (v) or (vi) and, solely
to the extent any such damages arise from or in connection with a Contract
Failure and therefore are indemnifiable under this Section 7.11 (or would be
indemnifiable under this Section but for the limitation in the proviso to the
preceding sentence), a breach of any of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.20(c)(i) and Section 3.12.    71     ARTICLE
VIII  TERMINATION   SECTION 8.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement and the Acquisition
contemplated hereby will be terminated, in cases (a) through (f) below, by
written notice given at any time prior to the Closing (whether before or
after the date of approval by the shareholders of Seller), and automatically,
in case (g) below:   (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;  
(b) by either Buyer or Seller, if the Closing has not occurred on or  before
December 31, 2000 (the "Stated Termination Date"); provided that  the Stated
Termination Date shall be automatically extended for three  months if, on
December 31, 2000 (i) any of the Consents of Governmental  Entities described
in Section 3.4 have not been obtained or waived, (ii)  each of the other
conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition has  been satisfied or
waived or remains capable of satisfaction and (iii) any  such Consent that
has not yet been obtained is being pursued diligently  and in good faith;
provided further that the right to terminate this  Agreement shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any  provision of this Agreement shall
have proximately contributed to the  failure of the Closing to have occurred
by such time;   (c) by either Buyer or Seller, if a material breach of any
provision  of this Agreement has been committed by the other party, such
breach has  not been waived and, if such breach is capable of being cured,
the other  party has not cured such breach fifteen (15) Business Days
following  receipt of notice of such breach from either Buyer or Seller, as
the case  may be; provided, however, that termination pursuant to this
Section  8.1(c) shall not relieve the breaching party of liability for such
breach  or otherwise;   (d) by either Buyer or Seller, if any Governmental
Entity shall have  issued, enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced any
Order, or taken any  other action restraining, enjoining, disapproving,
denying or otherwise  prohibiting the Acquisition or the consummation of any
other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and such Order or other
action shall have  become final and non-appealable, provided that the right
to terminate  this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) shall not be
available to  any party that has failed to fully comply with its obligations
hereunder  in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the
occurrence of  such Order;    72      (e) by either Buyer or Seller,
if the approval of the shareholders of  Seller shall not have been obtained
at the Shareholders Meeting;   (f) by Buyer, if the board of directors of
Seller shall have failed  to recommend or shall have withdrawn or adversely
modified or qualified  its recommendation of this Agreement, shall have
failed to reconfirm its  recommendation of this Agreement within five
business days after a written  request by Buyer to do so, or shall have
recommended to shareholders of  Seller an Acquisition Proposal; or   (g) at
any time prior to the shareholder approval of this Agreement,  automatically
if (i) Seller is not then in violation of Sections 5.2 and  5.22 and of the
first sentence of Section 5.23 (a) and (ii) Seller is  entering into a
legally binding agreement to give effect to a Superior  Proposal.   SECTION
8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination and abandonment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 of this Agreement, this Agreement
(other than Section 5.8 (Expenses), Section 8.3 (Termination Fee), Section
10.5 (Governing Law) and Section 10.6 (Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial) hereof which shall remain in full force and effect)
shall forthwith become null and void and no party hereto (or any of their
respective Representatives or Related Persons) shall have any Liability or
further obligation to any other party hereto, except as provided in this
Section 8.2; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a
party because of the deliberate or intentional breach of this Agreement by
the other party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating
party\'s obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the
other party\'s deliberate or intentional failure to fully comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, the terminating party\'s rights to pursue
all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.   SECTION 8.3

effect of  transferring, directly or indirectly, a material portion of, any
of the  Business, the aggregate assets of the Companies and the Company   
73     Subsidiaries, or the Shares, which fee shall be payable immediately
upon  such occurrence.   (iii) $5,000,000, if no Acquisition Proposal has

Acquisition  Transaction occurs, as long as such Acquisition Transaction has
the effect  of transferring, directly or indirectly, a material portion of,
any of the  Business, the aggregate assets of the Companies and the Company 
Subsidiaries, or the Shares, which fee shall be payable immediately upon 
such occurrence.   It is understood that Seller shall not be required to pay

the Representatives of each of them (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified

Indemnified Persons for, any and all losses, Liabilities, Actions,
deficiencies, diminution of value, expenses (including costs of investigation
and defense and reasonable attorneys\' and accountants\' fees and expenses),
or damages (including punitive damages) of any kind or nature whatsoever,
whether or not involving a third-party claim (collectively, "Damages"),

excluding (i) any such Damages relating to Taxes (as to which indemnification
is provided under Section 7.1), (ii) indemnification for any facts or

7.11 hereof and (iii) the amount of any such Damages to the extent that such

inaccuracy in any representation or warranty  made by Seller in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, the Disclosure  Schedule, or any other
certificate or document delivered by, or on behalf  of, Seller pursuant to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, other  than those, if any, that

indemnification from Seller pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof, any breach of
or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Seller shall be determined
without regard to any materiality qualifications set forth in such

similar terms shall be ignored for purposes of determining whether such
representation or warranty was true and correct when made.   SECTION 9.3
Indemnification and Reimbursement by Buyer.   (a) From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against, and
shall reimburse Seller for, any and all Damages incurred thereby or caused

writing by Seller, or (ii) any breach or violation of or failure to fully
perform any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation of Buyer set forth

representation or warranty, or covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation
to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, unless on or

one half of the sum of (i) the Purchase Price and (ii) the Special
Dividend.   SECTION 9.5 Limitations on Amount - Buyer.   (a) Buyer shall

(a) Notice. The party entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX
(the "Indemnitee") shall promptly notify the party liable for indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX (the "Indemnifying Party") and shall provide to
the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter all information and
documentation necessary to support and verify any Damages that the Indemnitee
shall have determined to have given or may give rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder and such other information and documentation as may
be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party
shall be given access to all books and records in the possession or under the
control of the Indemnitee which the Indemnifying Party reasonably determines
to be related to such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
Liability that it may have to any Indemnitee, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it is prejudiced by the Indemnitee\'s
failure to give such notice.   (b) Payment. In the event an action for
indemnification under this Article IX shall have been finally determined, the
amount of such final determination, subject to the limitations of Sections
9.4 and 9.5, shall be paid to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, on   
78    demand in immediately available funds. An action, and the liability
for and amount of Damages therefor, shall be deemed to be "finally
determined" for purposes of this Article IX when the parties to such action
have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final non-
appealable Order shall have been entered.   (c) Interest. Any amounts not
paid when due pursuant to this Article IX shall bear interest from the date
thereof until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate of Wachovia
Bank, N.A.   SECTION 9.7 Procedure for Indemnification - Third Party
Claims.   (a) Upon receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of
any Action by a third party (a "Third Party Claim") against it, such
Indemnitee shall, if a claim is to be made against an Indemnifying Party
under this Article IX, give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such Third Party Claim as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than ten (10) days after the Indemnitee shall have received
notice of such Third Party Claim, but the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
that it may have to any Indemnitee, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the Indemnitee\'s failure to give such
notice.   (b) If a Third Party Claim is brought against an Indemnitee and it
gives proper notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in
such Third Party Claim (unless the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such
Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee determines in good faith that joint
representation would be inappropriate) and, to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and
appoint lead counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee and provides
notice to the Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, as long as it conducts such
defense in a reasonable manner, be liable to the Indemnitee under this
Article IX for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the defense of such Third Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim,
other than reasonable costs of investigation.   If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise, discharge or
settlement of, or admission of Liability in connection with, such claims may
be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnitee\'s written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless
(A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation
of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be
made against the Indemnitee, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have no Liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of    79    such claims effected without its written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iii) the
Indemnitee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying
Party in connection with such defense, and shall have the right to
participate, at the Indemnitee\'s sole expense, in such defense, with counsel
selected by it. If proper notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of any Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not
give timely notice to the Indemnitee, but in no event later than twenty (20)
days after the Indemnitee\'s notice is given, of its election to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim (or if the Indemnitee is not entitled to
assume such defense pursuant to the first paragraph of this subsection (b)),
the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any determination made in such Third
Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnitee to
which the Indemnifying Party has consented (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnitee, which shall be promptly reimbursed for any such fees and
expenses, as and when incurred.   (c) The Indemnifying Party hereby consents
to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Third Party Claim
is brought against the Indemnitee for purposes of any claim that the
Indemnitee may have under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party
Claim or the matters alleged therein, and agrees that process may be served
on the Indemnifying Party with respect to such a claim anywhere in the
world.   (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Related
Persons to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim
and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.   SECTION 9.8 Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments. Seller and
Purchaser agree that any payment made under Article IX hereof will be treated
by the parties on their Tax returns as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.   SECTION 9.9 Remedies Exclusive. Absent a good faith claim of fraud
or wilful misconduct, the rights accorded to any Indemnitee under this
Agreement shall be the exclusive remedy available to such Indemnitee for any
breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant or any
other claim under or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer acknowledges that absent fraud, misrepresentation,
nondisclosure or any breach of this Agreement, the indemnification rights
provided under this Article IX constitute Buyer\'s sole remedy with respect
to any release of any Hazardous Substance prior to Closing and Buyer waives
any cause of action it may have under CERCLA with respect to such
release.    80     ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION 10.1
Assignments; Successors; No Third Party Rights. Neither party may assign any
of its rights under this Agreement (including by merger or other operation of
law) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which may
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void, except that Seller hereby agrees that
Buyer may assign all and/or any of its rights under this Agreement or
any Section of this Agreement to one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of
Buyer but any assignment will not relieve Buyer of its obligations under this
Agreement. In particular, one or more such Subsidiaries of Buyer may receive
certain of the Shares, the Transferred Property and/or the Seller
Intellectual Property. Upon Buyer\'s sale, disposition or other transfer, in
whole or in part, of the Business or assets or properties of any Company or
any Company Subsidiary, Seller hereby agrees that Buyer may assign, in whole
or in part, any of Buyer\'s indemnification rights related thereto set forth
in Section 7.1, 7.11 or Article IX hereof without the consent of Seller.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall apply to, be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their successors and permitted assigns and the parties indemnified
pursuant to Article IX hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, other than any Person entitled
to indemnity under Article IX hereof. This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their successors and permitted assigns.

Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 1, 2000, between Buyer and Seller (the

and supersede all other prior covenants, agreements, undertakings,
obligations, promises, arrangements, communications, representations and
warranties, whether oral or written, by any party hereto or by any director,
officer, employee, agent, Related Person or Representative of any party
hereto.   SECTION 10.3 Amendment or Modification. This Agreement may be
amended or modified only by written instrument signed by the parties
hereto.   SECTION 10.4 Notices. All notices, requests, instructions,

Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision or provisions shall be ineffective only to the extent
of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or provisions or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained herein,
unless such a construction would be unreasonable.   SECTION 10.8 Waiver of

party; (ii) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (iii) no notice to or
demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.   (b) The rights and remedies of
the parties hereto are cumulative and not alternative. Except where a
specific period for action or inaction is provided herein, neither the
failure nor any delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power

the part of any party of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single
or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. The failure of a party to exercise any right conferred herein

the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not to any
such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances.   SECTION 10.9 Actions of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries. Whenever this Agreement requires any Company or any Company

undertaking on the part of Seller to cause such Company or such Company
Subsidiary to take such action.   SECTION 10.10 Descriptive Headings;
Construction. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of

hereto, this Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all
such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.   SECTION

Premises at any reasonable time and without unreasonably interfering with
Lessee\'s business, after 24 hour advance notice to Lessee, emergencies
excepted, for the purpose of inspecting the same.   (e) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, if Lessee has actual knowledge of any condition
reasonably requiring any repair to the Premises or requiring the performance

insurance premiums.  12. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS   (a) Lessee shall, at
its expense, comply with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations and
insurance requirements in its use of the Premises, subject to the provisions
of the article hereof entitled "Repairs and Maintenance".   (b) Lessee

OF THE PREMISES   Should the Premises be destroyed or damaged in whole or in
part at any time during the Term by fire, earthquake, act of God, or acts of
the public enemy, or by any other casualty, the rights and duties of the
parties with respect to reconstruction, rebuilding or repair thereof, and
with respect to the continuance or termination of this Lease, shall be as
follows:   (a) If the cost of reconstructing, rebuilding or repairing is
less than fifty percent (50%) of the total value of all improvements,
excluding personal property and improvements made by Lessee, Lessor shall
reconstruct, rebuild or repair the Premises with no unreasonable delay, at
Lessor\'s sole cost and expense. During the period of such reconstruction,
rebuilding or repairing, the Base Rent herein provided to be paid by Lessee
shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in the same proportion that the area of
the Premises not able to be occupied by Lessee during such period bears to
the area of Premises prior to such casualty.   (b) If the cost of
reconstructing, rebuilding or repairing is fifty percent (50%) or more of the
total value of all improvements, excluding personal property and improvements
made by Lessee, either Lessee or Lessor may terminate this Lease at any time
within thirty (30) days from the date of such casualty upon notice to the
other. In the event this Lease is not so terminated, Lessor shall
reconstruct, rebuild or repair said Premises, exclusive of improvements made
by Lessee, without unreasonable delay, at Lessor\'s sole cost and expense. In
this event, the Base Rent shall be prorated during the period of such
reconstruction, rebuilding or repairing in the manner provided in
subparagraph (a) above.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions if,
in Lessee\'s reasonable opinion, the damage caused by any such casualty
cannot be repaired within ninety (90) days after the date    -8-    of
such casualty and in addition, such damage makes the use of said Premises
by Lessee impracticable, Lessee shall have the right at its option, to cancel
this Lease upon notice to Lessor within twenty (20) days from and after the
date of such casualty.   (d) Any such termination shall be deemed effective
as of the date of the casualty and each of the parties hereto shall be
relieved of all further obligations hereunder not accrued before said date,
except such obligations as, by their terms, must be performed or completed
after such termination.  15. DEFAULT   All the provisions of this Lease
are conditions precedent to be faithfully and fully performed and observed by
Lessee to entitle Lessee to continue its possession of the Premises, and:

Lessee to Lessor under this Lease, and if such default is not  rectified
within ten (10) days after written notice thereof is given  Lessee by Lessor
or if Lessee shall fail to keep in effect any  insurance required pursuant to
the terms of this Lease; or   (ii) if Lessee fails to perform any other
condition, covenant or  provision in this Lease (except the payment of rent)
and fails to  rectify said default within thirty (30) days after notice
thereof is  given to Lessee by Lessor, provided, however if such default
cannot  with reasonable diligence be rectified within said thirty (30) day 
period then it shall be deemed rectified if Lessee shall have  commenced to
rectify such default within said thirty (30) day period  and shall diligently
continue its efforts until such default is fully  rectified; or   (iii) if
Lessee shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or  insolvency, or shall
be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or shall  file any petition or answer
seeking any    -9-     reorganization, readjustment, liquidation,
dissolution or similar  relief under the present or any future federal
bankruptcy act or any  other present or future applicable federal, state or
other statute or  law (foreign or domestic), or shall make a general
assignment for the  benefit of creditors or shall seek or consent to or
acquiesce in the  appointment of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of
Lessee or of all  or any substantial part of Lessee\'s property; or   (iv)
If, within ninety (90) days after the commencement of any filing  by a third
party against Lessee of any proceeding of the nature  referred to in
subsection (iii) above, whether by the filing of a  petition or otherwise,
such proceeding shall not have been dismissed,  or if, within ninety (90)
days after the appointment of any trustee,  receiver or liquidator of Lessee
or of all or any substantial part of  Lessee\'s property, without the consent
of Lessee, such appointment  shall not have been vacated or otherwise
discharged, or if any  execution or attachment shall be issued against Lessee
or any of  Lessee\'s property pursuant to which the Premises shall be taken
or  occupied or attempted to be taken or occupied;  Lessor can avail itself
of all rights and remedies available to it, including, without limitation,
Lessor\'s right to evict Lessee and to collect all rent for the remainder of
the term of this Lease.   In the event Lessor commences any summary
proceeding or action for non-payment of rent, Lessee covenants and agrees not
to interpose, by consolidation of actions or otherwise, any counterclaim in
any such proceeding, it being agreed that nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to prevent Lessee from interposing a counterclaim if failure to do so
would constitute a waiver of the counterclaim or from bringing a separate
proceeding with respect to such counterclaim to be deemed a waiver thereof.
To the extent permitted by law, Lessor and Lessee hereby waive trial by jury
in any matter arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease. The
provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this
Lease.    -10-    16. QUIET ENJOYMENT   (a) If, and so long as,
