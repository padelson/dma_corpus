Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter. Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall cooperate with the Accountant and promptly provide all
documents and information requested by the Accountant. In making
such calculation, the Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts
in the Closing Statement and Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital
Adjustment as to which the Sellers Representative has disputed (and are

pursuant to Section 2.5(c). Such calculation shall be based solely on written
submissions by Buyer and the Sellers Representative and not by independent
review. In resolving any disputed items, the Accountant shall be bound by the
provisions of Section 2.5(b) and may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Accountant
shall deliver to the Sellers Representative and Buyer, as promptly as
practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days from the date of
engagement of the Accountant), a written report setting forth
such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Sellers and

the Sellers, and neither the Sellers nor the Sellers Representative shall
seek further recourse to courts or other tribunals, other than to enforce
such report. Judgment may be entered to enforce such report in any court of

Closing Documents to which he, she or it is a party. The execution, delivery
and performance by those Sellers that are institutional Sellers of this

Rata Share;  _provided_ , _however,_ that the Sellers Representative shall
not be entitled to indemnification for losses to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction has finally determined that the actions or omissions
of the Sellers Representative both (i) were taken or omitted not in good
faith and (ii) constituted willful default under this Agreement; _provided_
,  _however,_ that in no event shall Buyer or its Affiliates be responsible
for the Sellers Representatives actions or omissions in connection with
this Agreement or be responsible for indemnity or any amount claimed by the
Sellers Representative. Accordingly, the Sellers Representative shall not
incur any such liability with respect to (A) any action taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith upon advice of counsel given with respect to any
questions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Sellers
Representative under this Agreement or the related agreements or (B) any
action taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon any document,
including any written notice or instructions provided for in this Agreement
or any related agreements, not only as to its due execution and to the
validity and effectiveness of such documents provisions, but also as to the
truth and accuracy of any information contained in such document, which
the Sellers Representative does in good faith believe to be genuine, to have
been signed or presented by the purported proper Person or Persons and to
conform with the provisions of this Agreement or the related agreements. The
limitation of liability provisions of this Section 10.9(b) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Sellers
Representative. 

   

 (c) In carrying out its duties hereunder, Sellers Representative shall first utilize the Holdback Amount. In the event that the Sellers Representative incurs costs or expenses above such amount and within fifteen (15) days of delivery of invoices or other documentation setting forth in reasonable detail such costs or expenses, each of the remaining Sellers shall reimburse the Sellers Representative for his, her or its Pro Rata Share of such expenses. Upon termination of all indemnification obligations of Sellers hereunder and resolution of any pending indemnification claims, Sellers Representative shall pay to each Seller his, her or its Pro Rata Share of any remaining amount of the Holdback Amount.

class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in
the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on any
national or regional securities exchange or have been registered under
Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such Noncompete Party
agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its
duration, geographical area, and scope. 

   

 (ii) such Noncompete Party shall not, directly or indirectly, either for itself, himself or herself or any other Person, (A) induce or attempt to induce any employee of an Acquired Company to leave the employ of such Acquired Company, (B) in any way interfere with the relationship between an Acquired Company and any employee of such Acquired Company, (C) employ, or otherwise engage as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, any employee of an Acquired Company, or (D) induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee, or business relation of an Acquired Company to cease doing business with such Acquired Company, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any customer, supplier, licensee, or business relation of an Acquired Company. 

   

 (iii) such Noncompete Party shall not, directly or indirectly, either for himself or any other Person, solicit the business of any Person known to such Noncompete Party to be a customer of an Acquired Company, whether or not such Noncompete Party had personal contact with such Person, with respect to products or activities which compete in whole or in part with the products or activities of the Acquired Companies; 

  

 (b) In the event of a breach by such Noncompete Party of any covenant set forth in Section 10.10(a) of this Agreement, the term of such covenant shall be extended by the period of the duration of such breach; and 

  

 (c) such Noncompete Party shall not, at any time during or after the above-stated period, disparage Buyer or the Acquired Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates, shareholders, members, directors, governors, officers, employees, or agents. 

  

 (d) Buyer shall be entitled to seek a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of this Section 10.10 without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section 10.10 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity. 

  

 10.11 SCC MATTERS 

  

 (a) As of the Closing Date, SCC shall have no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether known or unknown and whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise) except for the SCC Liabilities. 

  

 (b) In the event that the 2006 Tax Return has not been filed by the Closing Date as a result of filing a request for extension thereof, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (" _PwC_ ") shall prepare the 2006 Tax Return no later than April 30, 2007. Buyer and Sellers shall review and comment on the 2006 Tax Return. The Sellers Representative shall approve the 2006 Tax 

   ##### 

  

 

Return prior to filing thereof, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The 2006 Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practices. 

   

 (c) As promptly as practicable, but within 30 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative shall deliver a written statement of the calculation of the SCC Assets and the SCC Liabilities the to the Buyer. If the Buyer disagrees with the calculation of the SCC Assets and the SCC Liabilities, the parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Sections 2.5(c) and 2.5(d) herein. 

  

 (d) If the Final SCC Assets are less than the Final SCC Liabilities, the Sellers Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer out of the Escrow Amount, within the later of (i) three (3) business days after determination of such amounts and (ii) receipt of the 2006 Tax Refund (if any) by SCC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of such difference. If the Final SCC Assets are greater than the Final SCC Liabilities, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers Representative, for the benefit of the SCC Sellers on a pro-rata basis (based on ownership of SCC), within the later of (i) three (3) business days after determination of such amounts and (ii) receipt of the 2006 Tax Refund (if any) by SCC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 11.5 JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS 

  

 Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement may be brought against any of the parties in the courts of the County of Cook, State of Illinois or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the federal courts located in the County of Cook, State of Illinois. Each of the parties expressly and irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the County of Cook, State of Illinois (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding, waives any objection to venue laid therein and agrees that each state and federal court located in the County of Cook, State of Illinois shall be deemed to be a convenient forum. Process in any such action or proceeding may be served by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 11.4. Nothing in this Section, however, affects the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Each of the parties hereby waives its rights to jury trial of any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that this waiver is a material inducement to enter into this Agreement, and that each party will continue to rely on the waiver in their future dealings. 

  

 11.6 FURTHER ASSURANCES 

  

 The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement. 

  

 11.7 WAIVER 

  

 The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, 

   ##### 

  

 

power, or privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party shall be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or
demand on one party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

Any disclosure related to a particular Section of this Agreement shall not be restricted solely to the representations and warranties in such Section as long as the information contained in the Part of the Disclosure Letter is reasonably apparent (by cross-reference or otherwise) that such information also constitutes a disclosure to a different Section of the Agreement. The numbering or references herein to Sections of this Agreement are for convenience and do not limit the disclosure concerning such numbered or referred to Section. 

  

 (b) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Letter (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Letter with respect to a specifically identified representation or warranty), the statements in the body of this Agreement shall control.

expressed or referred to in this Agreement shall be construed to give any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right,
remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement. Except as set forth in Article X, this Agreement and all of
its provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns. 

   

 11.11 SEVERABILITY 

  

 If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof must arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
