</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising
out of, this Agreement may be brought against any of the parties in the courts of the County of
Cook, State of Illinois or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the federal courts located in
the County of Cook, State of Illinois. Each of the parties expressly and irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the County of Cook, State of Illinois
(and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding, waives any objection to
venue laid therein and agrees that each state and federal court located in the County of Cook,
State of Illinois shall be deemed to be a convenient forum. Process in any such action or
proceeding may be served by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served
at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section&nbsp;11.4. Nothing in
this Section, however, affects the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law. Each of the parties hereby waives its rights to jury trial of any claim or cause
of action based upon or arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that
this waiver is a material inducement to enter into this Agreement, and that each party will
continue to rely on the waiver in their future dealings.

this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right,
