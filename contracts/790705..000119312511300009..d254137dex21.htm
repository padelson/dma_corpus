ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01. _The Merger._

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged
(the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with California Law,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place in Los Angeles, California at the offices of
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, as soon as possible, but in any event no later
than two (2) Business Days after the date on which the conditions set forth
in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the
extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the "Closing Date").

 



9 (c) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of California, in such form
as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of California Law. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of California (or at such later time as permitted by
California Law as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall be specified in
the Articles of Merger).

 

(d) The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement
and in the applicable provisions of California Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all the properties, rights, powers,
privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger
Subsidiary, all as provided under California Law.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares. _At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary,
the Company or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04,
each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash,
without interest (such per share amount, the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and each
uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (each, an "Uncertificated Share")
which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on
the stock transfer books of the Company, shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration;

 

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or owned by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank
or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying
Agent") to act as paying agent for the purpose of paying the Merger
Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock and shall enter into a
paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent,
for the

 



10  benefit (from and after the Effective Time) of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, for payment in accordance with this Section 2.03 through
the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.02. All cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
this Section 2.03(a) shall be referred to as the "Payment Fund." Promptly
after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2) Business Days
following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying
Agent to send, to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02(a) a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Paying Agent in accordance with the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal) for use in such payment. The Payment Fund may be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in short term obligations of the
United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days,
short term obligations guaranteed by the United States of America, commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.02 shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive only
the Merger Consideration to the extent provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 



11 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_ _. _Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly demanded that the Company purchase such shares in accordance with
Chapter 13 of California Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Holders
of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
Chapter 13 of California Law. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to dissent under Chapter 13 of
California Law, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
for payment of any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Chapter 13 of
California Law, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.05. _Stock Options and Other Equity Awards_ _._

 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Stock Option, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall become fully
vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Company Stock
Option, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. As used herein, the term "Company Stock Option" shall mean any
outstanding option under the Stock Plans to purchase shares of capital stock
of the Company. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option for which
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock equals or exceeds the
Merger Consideration shall be canceled and have no further effect, with no
right to receive any consideration therefor. As of the Effective Time, all
other Company Stock Options shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist and shall become only the right to receive
the option consideration

 



12  described in this Section 2.05(a), and, without limiting the foregoing, the
Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall
take all reasonable actions to effectuate the terms of this Section 2.05(a),
including obtaining any required participant consent.

 

(b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company or the
compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company will adopt
such resolutions and take such other reasonable actions as may be required to
provide that with respect to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP"): (A) participants in the ESPP may not alter their payroll deductions
from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue
their participation in the ESPP), (B) no offering period will be commenced
after the date of this Agreement, (C) any offering period under the ESPP that
is in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall terminate on the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement and all
amounts credited to the accounts of participants shall be used to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP (and
such shares shall be treated as other outstanding shares in accordance with
Section 2.02 of this Agreement); and (D) the ESPP shall be terminated,
effective as of the Effective Time.

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit shall become fully vested and
be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, less any applicable taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Board of Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee thereof
shall take all reasonable actions to effectuate the terms of this Section
2.05(c), including obtaining any required participant consent.

(d) _Company Share Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding share appreciation right entitling the holder thereof the right to
receive shares of Company Common Stock (or a cash payment determined in
relation to the value thereof) upon exercise issued pursuant to any
applicable Stock Plan (each, a "Company Share Appreciation Right"), whether or
not exercisable or vested, for which the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock is less than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled, and the
Company shall pay each holder of any such right at or promptly after the
Effective Time for each such Company Share Appreciation Right surrendered an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such right by (ii)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Share
Appreciation Right (assuming full vesting of all Company Share Appreciation
Rights). As of the Effective Time, each Company Share Appreciation Right for
which the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock equals or exceeds
the Merger Consideration shall be canceled and have no further effect, with no
right to receive any consideration therefor. As of the Effective Time, all
other Company Share Appreciation Rights shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist and shall become only the right to receive
the consideration described in this Section 2.05(d), and, without limiting
the foregoing, the Board of Directors of

 



13  the Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall take all reasonable
actions to effectuate the terms of this Section 2.05(d), including obtaining
any required participant consent. 

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate,
effective as of the Effective Time, the Stock Plans and any other plan,
program or arrangement (or provision thereof) for the issuance or grant of any
interest in respect of shares of Company Common Stock and ensure that neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will, as of and following the
Effective Time, be bound by any rights under the Stock Plans or any other
plan, program or arrangement (or provision thereof) providing for the issuance
or grant of any interest in respect of shares of Company Common Stock.

Section 2.06. _Adjustments_ _. _If, during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock shall occur, as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split),
merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other
similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of
such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights. _Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law, and if any such amounts are
deducted and withheld, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, as the case may be, timely pay such amounts to the appropriate Government
Authority. If the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates. _If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or
Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

documents required to be filed or furnished by the Company since January 1,
2008 (collectively, including those that the Company may file after the date
hereof until the Closing, together with any exhibits and schedules thereto
and other information incorporated therein, the "Company SEC Documents").

(b) As of its respective filing date (or, if amended or superseded, on

the date of such subsequent filing), each Company SEC Document filed pursuant
to the 1934 Act did not, or will not at the time it is filed, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of
the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. 

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it

to materially adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, known to management that involves management or other employees who

Company as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or

 



20  procedure. Since January 1, 2008, neither the Company nor any of its

so qualified, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an
application for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and the
Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter should
be revoked or not be issued or reissued. The Company has made available to
Parent prior to date of this Agreement copies of the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such Employee
Plan. Each Employee Plan has been maintained, administered and funded in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA, the Code
and the Applicable Laws of the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction which are

4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code. There are (i) no material pending or,

Agreement, with respect to each current or former employee, director or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its

Agreement will not, either alone or together with any other event: (i) entitle
any such person to severance pay, bonus amounts, retirement benefits, job
security benefits or similar benefits, (ii) trigger or accelerate the time of
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation
or benefits payable to any such person, (iii) accelerate the vesting of any
compensation or benefits of any such person (including any stock options or
other equity-based awards, any incentive compensation or any deferred
compensation entitlement) or (iv) trigger any other material obligation to
any such person. Except as set forth in Section 4.16(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no Contract or plan (written or otherwise)
covering any current or former employee or independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively
with other such Contracts or plans, could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or
162(m) of the Code. Section 4.16(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
(A) all agreements, arrangements and other instruments which give rise to an

correct copies of the fully executed commitment letters, dated as of the date
hereof, between each of Siris Partners II, L.P. and the other investors party
thereto (collectively, the "Sponsors"), on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand (collectively, the "Equity Financing Commitments" and, together
with the Debt Financing Commitment, the "Financing Commitments"), pursuant to
which the investor parties thereto have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to invest in Parent the cash amounts set forth

"Financing"). None of the Financing Commitments have been amended or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, and as of the date hereof no
such amendment or modification is contemplated and the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect and, to the knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission is
contemplated. Except for fee letters relating to fees with respect to the

without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge
of Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments.
Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary are, as of the date hereof, aware of any
fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements
set forth in the

the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 4.05, the performance in all material respects by the
Company of its obligations under this Agreement, and the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article 9, Parent has no reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will
not be satisfied. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Financing Commitment, the accuracy of the representations and warranties set

Subsidiaries made available to Parent have been prepared in good faith upon
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, as of the Effective
Time, after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the payment of all fees, costs and expenses payable with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and in any loans or financing
agreements in connection herewith, the Surviving Corporation shall be solvent

Section 6.02. _Shareholder Meeting; Proxy Material_ _. _The Company
shall cause a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Meeting")
to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable following
confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments to the Company Proxy
Statement for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall recommend approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Companys shareholders. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, an Adverse Recommendation Change permitted
by Section 6.03(b) will not constitute a breach by the Company of this
Agreement. In connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting, the Company
shall (i) after consultation with Parent, promptly prepare and file with the
SEC, use its reasonable best efforts to respond to the SECs comments or
requests for additional information regarding and thereafter mail to its
shareholders as promptly as practicable the Company Proxy Statement and all
other proxy materials for such meeting, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, including soliciting proxies from
its shareholders, and (iii) otherwise comply in all material respects with
all legal requirements applicable to such meeting; _provided, however,_ that
the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the Company
Shareholder Meeting (but not beyond the End Date) (a) if and to the
extent necessary to obtain a quorum (either in person or by proxy) of its
shareholders to take action at the Company Shareholder Meeting, (b) if and to
the extent the Company determines in good faith that such delay, adjournment,
or postponement is required by Applicable Law and/or (c) if in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof
(after consultation with its legal counsel) such delay or postponement is
necessary or appropriate, including in order to give the Companys
shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any new information or disclosure
that the Company has sent them or otherwise made available to the Companys
shareholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC, or
otherwise. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon receipt of any
comments or requests for information from the SEC or its staff or any other
Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to the Company Proxy
Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, its
staff or any other Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to
the Company Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
above, prior to filing or mailing the Company Proxy Statement (including any
amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement) or responding to any
comments or requests for additional information by the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority with respect thereto, the Company

 



38  shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such documents or responses and shall include in such documents or responses
comments reasonably proposed by Parent. 

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct its and their officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other
authorized agents, advisors or representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, any Third Party that to the knowledge of the Company is
seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw, qualify
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or publicly propose to withdraw,
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation, or recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose to
recommend, adopt or approve an Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in
this clause (iii), whether taken by the Companys Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) terminate, amend,
modify, grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce any standstill,
confidentiality or similar agreement with respect to any equity or voting
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or publicly propose to
do any of the foregoing, or (v) enter into any agreement in principle, letter
of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar instrument constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct their
respective Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall instruct any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors)
in possession of confidential information about the Company that was
furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy all such
information.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders, the Board of Directors of
the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(c), and Section
6.03(d), (i) engage in negotiations or discussions (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal or counter offer to) with any Third Party
that, subject to the Companys compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made after
the date of this Agreement a Superior Proposal or an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company believes in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party nonpublic
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes
specifically necessary for the Company to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement and it being understood that the Company may enter into a
confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision); _provided_ that all
such information (to the extent that such

 



39  information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party, and (iii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but in each
case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel to the Company, that failure to take such action could reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from (x) disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under
the 1934 Act or Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act or (y) making any required
disclosure to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of
such Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to violate
its obligations under Applicable Law.

(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the
actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 6.03(b) unless the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent
that it intends to take such action, and the Company shall continue to advise
Parent after delivery of such notice of the status and material terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 48 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry that would be reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that to the knowledge of the Company may be considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall
identify the Person making and material terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request (including all related transaction
document(s) and any material changes thereto). 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not be permitted to approve or
recommend another Acquisition Proposal unless (i) it has in all material
respects complied with the provisions of this Section 6.03, (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel to the Company, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (iii) prior to any such approval or recommendation of another
Acquisition Proposal, the Company has provided a written notice to Parent (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal") that the Company intends to take such action
and describing the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal
that is the basis of such action, including with such Notice of Superior
Proposal a copy of the relevant proposed transaction document(s) related to
the Superior Proposal, (iv) during the three (3) Business Day period
following Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors, to negotiate with
Parent and Merger Subsidiary (to the extent Parent and Merger Subsidiary
desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, (iv) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent to the Company in response to the 

 



40  Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving
rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this Section 6.03(d) (provided that references to the three
(3) Business Day period above shall be deemed reference to a forty-eight hour
period).

 

(e) "Superior Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal (with
the percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 20% to
50%) made in writing and not solicited in violation of Section 6.03(a) that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal would result in a transaction (i) that if
consummated, is more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger or, if applicable, any binding proposal by
Parent capable of being accepted by the Company to amend the terms of this
Agreement taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, taking into account any governmental and other approval
requirements), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on the
terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the Person making the
proposal, any approval requirements and all other financial, legal and other
aspects of such proposal, and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company.

 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_ _. _From the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice and
request, (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to its offices, properties, books and records, (ii) furnish to Parent,
its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives
such financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may
reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate with
Parent in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall
be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this
Section shall, prior to the Effective Time, require the Company to take any
action that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company, constitute a
waiver of the attorney-client or similar privilege or trade secret protection
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or violate
confidentiality obligations owing to third parties; provided, however, that
the Company shall make a good faith effort to accommodate any request from
Parent for access or information pursuant to this Section in a manner that
does not result in such a waiver or violation. All information furnished
pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement,
dated as of May 19, 2011 (as amended as of August 15, 2011), between Parent
and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). The Company hereby
consents to include the Sponsors and the Financing Sources as permitted
"Representatives," co-bidders, co-investors and/or financing sources under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Section 7.01. _Director and Officer Liability_ _. _Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each current and former
officer and director of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each Person who
served as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an "Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by California Law or any
other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys amended and
restated articles of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and
indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, each in effect on
the date hereof; provided, however, that such advance shall be conditioned
upon the Surviving Companys receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined
by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified
Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.01(a)),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
arbitration, proceeding or investigation in respect of or arising out of acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by California Law or any other
Applicable Law or provided under the Companys amended and restated
articles of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and indemnification
agreements with its officers and directors, each in effect on the date hereof;
provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under Applicable Law. In the event of any such action,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such action.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full
force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time the
provisions in existence in the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective
Organizational Documents and the Companys indemnification agreements with its
officers and directors in effect on the date of this Agreement regarding
elimination of liability of directors, indemnification and exculpation of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses.

 

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide officers and directors liability,
fiduciary liability and similar insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each Indemnified Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the
Companys DandO Insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount
no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date of this
Agreement, as well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person
under ERISA (or a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to Parent providing coverage benefits and terms 

 



42  no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than the Companys current such
policies, as well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person
under ERISA; for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may purchase such "tail
policy" at its option prior to the Effective Time, and in such case, Parent
shall cause such policy to be in full force and effect for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation);
_provided_ that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.01(c), the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in the
aggregate in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement; _provided further_ that, if the aggregate
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a DandO Insurance policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or the Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.01.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.01
shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
California Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

Section 7.02. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain
employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time (the "Current Employees") will be provided with (i) base
salary and cash bonus opportunities (excluding long-term incentive
opportunities and transaction or retention bonuses) which are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the aggregate base salary and cash bonus
opportunities (excluding long-term incentive opportunities and transaction or
retention bonuses) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) retirement and welfare benefits and
perquisites (excluding equity and equity-based benefits and defined benefit
pension benefits, except as required by Applicable Law) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than those set forth in any employment or
severance agreement between the Company and any such Current Employee or any
severance policy or practice of the Company or its Subsidiaries (as
applicable) with respect to the Current Employees in effect on the date hereof
listed on Section 7.02(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and made
available to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that the
terms and conditions of employment of

 



43  any employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements or
otherwise represented for purposes of collective bargaining by labor
organizations shall be as provided in such collective bargaining agreements
and applicable law.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Current
Employee first becomes eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time
(the "New Company Plans"), Parent shall (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Current Employee under any health and welfare
New Company Plans in which such Current Employee may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time and (ii) recognize service of Current
Employees (or otherwise credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries) accrued
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate in and
vesting credit under (but not for the purposes of benefit accrual) any
New Company Plan in which such Current Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, provided, however, that in no event
shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

(c) Parent agrees to cause the Company following the Closing
to maintain, and fulfill all of its obligations under, the Companys 2007
Officer Severance Plan, as amended, and 2011 Officer Severance Plan, in each
case as in effect as of the date hereof.

 

(d) No provision of this Section 7.02 (i) creates any third-party
beneficiary or other rights, including any rights of continued employment or
rights to a particular term of employment, for any employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) other than
Parent, the Company and their respective successors and assigns, or (ii)
constitutes an employment agreement or an amendment to or adoption of any
employee benefit plan of or by any member of Parent, the Company or their
Subsidiaries. Provided that Parent shall, in all events, continue to perform
and satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.02, no provision of this
Section 7.02 shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate
any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them in accordance with the
terms of such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and Applicable Law.

ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly
as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may
be requested pursuant to the Antitrust Filings and to use their reasonable
best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the grant of
clearance or the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
with respect to the Antitrust Filings as soon as practicable. In addition,
Parent shall use its best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain any consent, waiver, approval or
authorizations relating to the HSR Act or similar non-U.S. laws that are
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which efforts shall include, without limitation, the proffer by
Parent of its willingness to accept an order providing for the divestiture by
Parent of such of its assets and businesses as are necessary to fully
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and an offer to
hold separate such assets and businesses pending such divestiture. In the
event that the FTC or the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority requires the
divestiture or the holding separate by Parent of any assets, no adjustment
shall be made to the Merger Consideration and Parent shall be required to
hold such assets separate, or to divest them, as the case may be, following
the Closing.

 

Section 8.02. _ Certain Filings_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in
connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement, (ii) in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Contracts to which
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith or with the Company Proxy Statement and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 



45 (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other
party of any communication it receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority and shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
representatives and any Governmental Authority. Neither Parent nor the Company
shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting.

 

Section 8.03. __ _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment in the most expeditious manner possible, but in any event on or
prior to the End Date, and shall not amend, modify or permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification or waiver would (x)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or
similar fee) to the extent that Parent would then not have sufficient funds
to pay the Merger Consideration, or (y) impose new or additional conditions,
or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the
Debt Financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (1) impair, delay or prevent the Closing, (2) make the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing)
less likely to occur, or (3) adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.03 and provided that the
representations set forth in Section 5.06 shall be true and correct giving
effect to such replacement or amendment, Parent and Merger Subsidiary may
replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, unless the addition of such
additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would be likely to
result in Parent not having sufficient funds to pay the Merger Consideration
or adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby on or prior to the End Date or the
likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the
availability of the Financing on or prior to the End Date. For purposes of
this Section 8.03, references to "Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments as permitted to be amended or
modified by this Section 8.03 and references to "Financing Commitments" or
"Debt Financing Commitment" shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended or modified by this Section 8.03. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in full force and effect the Debt Financing Commitment in accordance
with its terms until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary in the Debt 

 



46  Financing Commitment (including by consummating the financing pursuant to
the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments) and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder, in each case, that are within Parents or any of its
Affiliates control, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions (including any flex provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or on such other terms as shall
be acceptable to Parent and the Financing Sources (as long as such terms do
not adversely affect the amount of financing to be provided or cause the
funding of the Debt Financing to be less likely to occur), (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (v) fully enforce their
rights under the Debt Financing Commitment, including by bringing legal action
or other appropriate proceedings, against any Financing Source to enforce
their respective rights under the Debt Financing Commitment and, as may be
appropriate, to fund in accordance with their respective commitments if all
conditions to funding the Debt Financing in the applicable document have been
satisfied or waived, and (vi) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, cause the lenders and
other Persons providing Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing
contemplated to be funded on the Closing Date by the Debt Financing
Commitment (or such lesser amount as may be required to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the
Company prompt written notice: (A) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
any Financing Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing of
which Parent or its Affiliates becomes aware; (B) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to
any (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to
the Financing or any provisions of the Financing Commitments or any definitive
document related to the Financing or (y) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or any definitive
document related to the Financing which would create a risk that the funding
of the Debt Financing would be less likely to occur (but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms
of the Financing or any definitive agreement with respect thereto); and (C) if
for any reason Parent or Merger Subsidiary believes in good faith it will not
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms or in the
manner contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents
related to the Financing; _provided,_ that in no event will Parent or Merger
Subsidiary be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall have used their reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. If any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on substantially the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions that are no less favorable to
Parent, taken as a whole, than those set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent will furnish to the Company correct and
complete copies of any Debt Financing Commitment and ancillary documents
thereto (redacted to the extent necessary to comply with confidentiality
agreements, provided that such redacted information does not relate to the
amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the
funding of the Debt Financing).

 



47 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to use its reasonable best efforts to provide
to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, at Parents sole expense, all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and
causing the conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment to be satisfied,
including, without limitation, (i) furnishing Parent and Merger Subsidiary and
their Financing Sources with the financial statements and financial data of
the Company required by paragraph 5 of Exhibit C of the Debt Financing
Commitment, (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or
agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and
the executive chairman, chief executive officer, chief operating officer,
chief financial officer and general counsel of the Company and other members
of senior management and Representatives of the Company), presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) assisting Parent and its
Financing Sources in the preparation of customary offering memoranda, bank
information memoranda, authorization letters, confirmations and undertakings
in connection with the offering memoranda and the bank information memoranda
and lender presentations relating to the Debt Financing, (iv) providing and
executing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (A)
documents requested by the Parent or its Financing Sources relating to the
repayment of the existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the release of related Liens, including customary payoff letters and (to the
extent required) evidence that notice of such repayment has been timely
delivered to the holders of such debt; (B) all documentation and other
information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-
your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
Patriot Act; (C) a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company
with respect to solvency matters; and (D) agreements, documents or
certificates that facilitate the creation, perfection or enforcement of Liens
securing the Debt Financing (including original copies of all certificated
securities (with transfer powers executed in blank), control agreements,
surveys, title insurance, landlord consent and access letters) as are
reasonably requested by the Parent or its Financing Sources, (vi) executing
and delivering any pledge and security documents and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of collateral, (vii) cooperating with the Financing
Sources due diligence investigation and evaluation of the Companys assets
for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements, to the extent
customary and reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with the business
of the Company, and (viii) providing any other documents, instruments,
certificates or information as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the Debt Financing; _provided, however,_ that, (1) irrespective of the above,
no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate,
document or instrument (other than the authorization and representation
letters referred to above) shall be effective until the Effective Time and
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any
action under any certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent
upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement that is effective
before the Effective Time) or that would be effective prior to the Effective
Time and (2) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs)
in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the
Effective Time. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;  __

 



48   _provided_ that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not
intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If this Agreement is terminated prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section
8.03(b).

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition
to Closing.

 

Section 8.04. _Public Announcements_ _._ Except with respect to the
announcement of any Adverse Recommendation Change (or proposed Adverse
Recommendation Change) in accordance with Section 6.03, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any
other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or
association, shall not issue any such press release, make any such other
public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call
before such consultation.

 

Section 8.05. _Stock Exchange De-listing_ _._ Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
Applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the de-listing by
the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the 1934 Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date.

Section 8.06. _Further Assurances_ _. _ At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

Section 8.07. _Notices of Certain Events_ _._ Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly notify the other of:

 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to a risk of termination set forth in Section
10.01(c)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(ii), as the case may be; and

 



49 (c) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of termination set forth
in Section 10.01(c)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(ii), as the case may be;

_provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
8.07 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving that notice.

Section 8.08. _Director Resignations_ _. _The Company shall obtain and
deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of
the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company designated by Parent to the Company
in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

Section 8.09. _Takeover Statutes_ _. _If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions. Neither the Company nor its Board
of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall take any action to permit any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 8.10. _Shareholder Litigation_ _. _In the event that any
shareholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought against the Company

Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof. The Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with respect
to the defense or settlement of any such shareholder litigation. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company shall compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding any such shareholder litigation or consent to
the same unless Parent shall have consented in writing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 8.11. _Rule 16b-3_ _. _The Company shall, and shall be permitted
to, take all actions as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to
cause any dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities)
of the Company by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company,

exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act.

Tekelec International, SPRL, and the lenders party thereto (the "Credit

Subsidiaries securing such Obligations shall be, upon the payment of the
Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, released and terminated. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to deliver all notices and take all other actions, including with
respect to the backstop or termination of any letters of credit issued under
the Credit Agreement and any hedging or swap obligations secured under the
Credit Agreement, to facilitate the termination of commitments under the
Credit Agreement, the repayment in full of all Obligations then outstanding
thereunder (using funds arranged by Parent or Merger Subsidiary) and the
release of all Liens and termination of all guarantees in connection therewith
on the Closing Date (such termination, repayment and release, the "Credit

Subsidiary set forth in the Equity Financing Commitments that are within their

inaction), any term of the Equity Financing Commitments without the prior

notify the Company promptly if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the
Equity Financing Commitments expire or are terminated for any reason (or if
any person attempts or purports to terminate the Equity Financing Commitments,
whether or not such attempted or purported termination is valid), (ii) the
investor parties thereto refuse to provide or express an intent in writing to
refuse to provide the full Equity Financing on the terms set forth in the

cash in excess of the reasonable needs of the non-U.S. Subsidiaries prior to
Closing, as requested by the Parent, in as tax- and cost-efficient manner as
reasonably practicable effective immediately prior to the Closing; provided
however that the Company (i) may undertake any action it reasonably believes
necessary to mitigate risk to the Company and its Subsidiaries from such
repatriation should the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not Close
and (ii) shall not be required to undertake any action that in its reasonable
belief would create a material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries
or any officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

reasonable efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, file a claim for a refund of U.S. federal income taxes paid by the

56 Section 11.04. _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as contemplated by Section 8.03(b) or this Section 11.04,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be

or, if the Company Payment Event is pursuant to clause (y) below, the Company
Termination Fee shall be paid within two (2) Business Days following the

Event.

 

"Company Payment Event" means the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
(x) Section 10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(d)(i), (y) Section 10.01(b)(i), but
only in the case of clause (y) if the Company Shareholder Meeting has not been
held by the End Date, or (z) Section Section 10.01(b)(iii) or Section
10.01(c)(ii), but only in the case of clause (y) or clause (z) (A) prior to
such termination under Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(c)(ii) or the
taking of a vote to approve this Agreement at the Company Shareholder Meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of a termination

made to the shareholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise been
publicly disclosed or proposed by a Third Party and not withdrawn prior to
such termination under Section 10.01(b)(i), Section 10.01(c)(ii) or vote to
approve this Agreement, as applicable, and (B) within twelve (12) months
following the date of such termination the Company consummates a transaction

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section

Days following such termination.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledge, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
without these agreements, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company would not
enter into this Agreement, and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, any amount payable pursuant to this Section 11.04 is not a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate (x) Parent and Merger Subsidiary in the circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is payable and (y) the Company in the circumstances in
which the Parent Termination Fee is payable, for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the

 



57  transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision,

(e) In the event that the Company Termination Fee becomes payable and
is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 11.04, the right to receive
the Company Termination Fee shall constitute each of Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys and each of their respective Affiliates and representatives
sole and exclusive remedy.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to effect the Closing or otherwise
breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder, then, except as and only
to the extent expressly permitted by Section 11.13, the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against the Parent Related Parties in respect of this Agreement,
any Contract executed in connection herewith (including the Equity Financing
Commitments, the Limited Guarantee and the Debt Financing Commitment, but
excluding the Confidentiality Agreement) and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
(and subject to the conditions of) Article 10 and collect, if due, the Parent
Termination Fee and any reimbursement obligations under Section 8.03(b) and
the Limited Guarantee from Parent or Guarantor pursuant to the Limited
Guarantee, and upon payment of such amounts in accordance with Section 8.03(b)
and this Section 11.04, except as provided in Section 11.13, (A) no Parent
Related Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith
(including the Equity Financing Commitments, the Limited Guarantee and the
Debt Financing Commitment, but excluding the Confidentiality Agreement) or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (B) neither the Company
nor any other Company Related Party shall be entitled to bring or maintain
any Action against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other Parent Related Party
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any Contract executed in
connection herewith (including the Equity Financing Commitments, the Limited
Guarantee and the Debt Financing Commitment, but excluding the Confidentiality
Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination, and (C) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause any Actions pending in connection with this Agreement, any Contract
executed in connection herewith (including the Equity Financing Commitments,
the Limited Guarantee and the Debt Financing Commitment, but excluding the
Confidentiality Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, to the extent maintained by the Company or another Company Related
Party against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other Parent Related Party, to
be dismissed with prejudice promptly following the payment of any such
amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) under no circumstances shall the
Company be entitled to collect the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion and (y) under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the obligation to
close contemplated by Section 11.13 that results in the Merger occurring and
any money damages, including the Parent Termination Fee. In connection with
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith, in each case, other than in a circumstance in which the
Company is permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 11.04 or any reimbursement
obligations under Section 8.03(b) or the

 



58  Limited Guarantee, the Company agrees that the maximum aggregate liability
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be limited to an amount equal to the
amount of the Parent Termination Fee plus any reimbursement obligations under
Section 8.03(b) and the Limited Guarantee, and in no event shall the Company
seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount. In no event shall
the Company seek equitable relief or to recover monetary damages from any
Parent Related Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than (i) Parent and Merger Subsidiary pursuant to (and subject
to the conditions of) this Agreement and (ii) monetary damages from the
Guarantor pursuant to (and subject to the conditions of) the Limited
Guarantee.

Section 11.05. _Disclosure Schedule References._ If and to the extent any
information required to be furnished in any Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is contained in this Agreement or in any other Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, such information shall be deemed to be included in all
Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule in which the information would
otherwise be required to be included to the extent that the disclosure is
reasonably apparent from its face to be applicable to such other Sections of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Section
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be considered an admission by the
Company that such item or fact (or any non-disclosed item or information of
comparable or greater significance) represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, that such item or
fact will in fact exceed any applicable threshold limitation set forth in the
Agreement and shall not be construed as an admission by the Company of any
non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party rights (including but
not limited to any intellectual property rights) or any Applicable Law of any
Governmental Authority, such disclosures having been made solely for the
purposes of creating exceptions to the representations made herein or of
disclosing any information required to be disclosed under the Agreement.

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except
as provided in Section 7.01, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto

intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein, upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns, except (i) as provided in Section
7.01, (ii) for the provisions of Section 11.04(f) and Section 11.08(b), which
shall also be for the benefit of the Financing Sources and their respective
Affiliates, employees, directors, controlling persons, officers, agents,
attorneys, stockholders or partners or assignees of any of the foregoing and
(iii) for the provisions of Article 2 which, from and after the Effective
Time, shall be for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company
Restricted Stock Units, Company Stock Options and Company Share Appreciation
Rights as of the Effective Time.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of each other party hereto; _provided, however,_ that Parent or Merger
Subsidiary may assign its rights, interests or obligations under

 



59  this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the other
parties hereto, but no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of
its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 11.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state; provided, that the laws of
the State of California shall govern with respect to the Merger.

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction_.

(a)  Subject to Section 11.08(b) below, the parties hereto agree that
any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in Delaware (the
"Chosen Courts"), so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, and that any such Action arising out of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the
State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such Action in any such court or that any such
Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or Action may be served on any party anywhere
in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

 

(b) Each party to this Agreement acknowledges and irrevocably agrees
(i) that any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, involving any of the Financing Sources or any Affiliate
thereof arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Debt Financing
Commitment or the performance thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in
the City and State of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof (it
being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the selection of such
exclusive jurisdiction, the interpretation of "Material Adverse Effect" and
whether there shall have occurred a "Material Adverse Effect" shall be
determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflict of laws rules of such state), (ii) not to bring or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any
such Action in any other court and (iii) to waive any right to trial by jury
in respect of any such Action.

Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. Delivery of a signed counterpart

 



60  of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or by PDF file (portable
document format file) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when
each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of
the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 11.12. _Severability_ _. _If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled, without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen Courts, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the provisions of Section 11.04(f), however, the parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause
Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary (A) to enforce the terms of the Debt Financing
Commitment (including by demanding Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary to file
one or more lawsuits against the sources of Debt Financing to fully enforce
such sources obligations thereunder and Parents, Holdings and Merger Subs
rights thereunder) and (B) to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity
Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Financing
Commitments and to cause Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary to effect the Closing
in accordance with Section 2.01, in each case, if and only if (a) all
conditions in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(and which are, at the time that the Company seeks specific performance
pursuant to this Section 11.13, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were
to occur at such time) or the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable
primarily to a breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement), (b) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the
date the Closing is required to have

 



61  occurred pursuant to Section 2.01(b) upon delivery of a drawdown notice by
Parent, Holdings or Merger Subsidiary and/or notice from Parent that the
Equity Financing will be funded at such date, (c) Parent and Merger
Subsidiary fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to Section 2.01(b), (d) the Company has confirmed in
writing to Parent that all conditions set forth in Section 9.03 have been
satisfied or that it would be willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in
Section 9.03 for purposes of consummating the Merger, and (e) such specific
performance would result in the consummation of the Merger in accordance with
this Agreement substantially contemporaneously with the consummation of the
Debt Financing and the Equity Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, (y) in no
event shall the exercise of the Companys right to seek specific performance
or other equitable relief pursuant to this Section 11.13 reduce, restrict or
otherwise limit the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(iii) and be paid the Parent
Termination Fee; _provided_ , that under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that
results in the Merger occurring pursuant to this Section 11.13 and the
payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee, and (z) the
Companys right to seek specific performance pursuant to this Section 11.13
shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Subsidiary
to fully enforce the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments, including by
requiring Parent and Merger Subsidiary to file one or more lawsuits against
any Sponsor to fully enforce the obligations of such Sponsor under an Equity
Financing Commitment. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity.
