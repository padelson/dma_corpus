Exhibit B

 |  | Joinder Agreement 
   | 
  

Exhibit C

 |  | Forms of Merger Sub and NewCo Organizational Documents AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of July 15, 2018, by and between: TIDEWATER INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and GULFMARK OFFSHORE, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company" and, together with Parent, the "Parties"). Certain capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

 

 _R ECITALS _

 

A. In order to effect this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions,
including the Mergers, Parent will (i) form or cause to be formed a new
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent in the form of a corporation organized in
the State of Delaware ("Merger Sub"), and another new wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent in the form of a limited liability company organized in the State
of Delaware ("NewCo"), and (ii) cause both Merger Sub and NewCo to become
parties to this Agreement promptly following each such entitys formation by
virtue of the execution and delivery of one or more Joinder Agreements
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

 

B. The Parties intend that, at the First Merger Effective Time, Merger Sub
be merged with and into the Company (the "First Merger") in accordance with
this Agreement and the DGCL. Upon consummation of the First Merger, Merger Sub
will cease to exist and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation") and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

C. As part of the Integrated Transaction, immediately following the First
Merger, the Surviving Corporation will merge with and into NewCo (the "Second
Merger," and together with the First Merger, the "Mergers") in accordance with
this Agreement, the DGCL and the DLLCA. Upon consummation of the Second
Merger, the Surviving Corporation will cease to exist and NewCo will continue
as the surviving company (the "Surviving Company") and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent.

 

D. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the
Mergers and other Contemplated Transactions to be consummated, certain
stockholders of the Company are executing voting and support agreements in
favor of Parent concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
(the "Voting Agreements").

 

E. The Company Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Mergers are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (ii)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, including the Mergers; and (iii) recommended that the Companys
stockholders adopt this Agreement.

 

F. The Parent Board has unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of its stockholders for Parent to enter into this Agreement; (ii)
approved this Agreement and the Parent Share Issuance; and (iii) recommended
that Parents stockholders approve the Parent Share Issuance.

 

G. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended (i) that the First
Merger and the Second Merger, taken together, will constitute an integrated
plan (the "Integrated Transaction") and qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations to
which each of Parent, Merger Sub, NewCo and the Company are to be parties
under Section 368(b) of the Code, and (ii) this Agreement is intended to
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354, 361
and 368 of the Code. _A GREEMENT _

 

The Parties agree as follows:

 

Section 1. THE MERGERS

 

1.1 Pre-Mergers Steps. Prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting,
Parent shall form, or cause to be formed, each of Merger Sub and NewCo, in
each case pursuant to the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit C, and shall
take, or cause to be taken, all necessary corporate or limited liability
company actions for each of Merger Sub, NewCo and Parent (as sole equityholder
of each of Merger Sub and NewCo) to adopt and approve this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including the Mergers.

1.2 The Mergers.

 

(a) At the First Merger Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company in accordance with the DGCL and upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the First Merger Effective Time, all the
property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation and all of the debts,
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, obligations, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

(b) At the Second Merger Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall be
merged with and into NewCo in accordance with the DGCL and DLLCA and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the
separate existence of Surviving Corporation shall cease and NewCo shall be the
Surviving Company. From and after the Second Merger Effective Time, all the
property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of the Company, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation shall be vested in Surviving Company and all of
the debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall become the debts, obligations,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under the
DGCL and the DLLCA.

 

1.3 Closing; First Merger Effective Time; Second Merger Effective Time.

 

(a) The closing of the Mergers (the "Closing") shall take place on the date
that is the later of (x) the third Business Day after the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements) waiver of the last
to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements) waived of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ (other
than the conditions, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver at Closing of each of such
conditions) and (y) January 3, 2019, so long as all of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ (other than the conditions, which by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
at Closing of each of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived.
Notwithstanding the foregoing if, on the date established by the foregoing
clause (x), there is an Extension Event, then closing shall take place on the
earlier of (1) the next Business Day that no Extension Event shall exist and
(2) January 3, 2019, so long as, in each case of the previous clause "(1)" and
"(2)", all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ (other than the
conditions, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver at Closing of each of such conditions)
have been satisfied or waived. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) so long as all
of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ (other than the conditions,
which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver at Closing

 



2  of each of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived, the Closing shall
not take place later than January 3, 2019 and (ii) nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 1.3(a)_ shall affect the rights of the Parties under _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)_. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP, 200 Crescent Court, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas, unless another place is
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing
actually takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date."

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, concurrently with or as
soon as practicable following the Closing, the Parties shall cause a
certificate of merger with respect to the First Merger (the "First Merger
Certificate") to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by the
DGCL in connection with effecting the First Merger. The First Merger shall
become effective at the time when the First Merger Certificate has been duly
filed with and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in
the First Merger Certificate (the "First Merger Effective Time").

 

(c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, immediately following the
First Merger Effective Time, the Parties shall cause a certificate of merger
with respect to the Second Merger (the "Second Merger Certificate") to be duly
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL and DLLCA in
connection with effecting the Second Merger. The Second Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Second Merger Certificate has been duly filed
with and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such later time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in
the Second Merger Certificate (the "Second Merger Effective Time"), which,
unless the Parties agree otherwise, shall be immediately following the First
Merger Effective Time.

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Certificate of Formation and
Limited Liability Company Agreement.

(a) As of the First Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any further action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any
other Person, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended
to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time (except the
name shall remain GulfMark Offshore, Inc. and the provisions relating to the
incorporator shall be omitted), and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(b) As of the First Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any further action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any
other Person, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended to conform to the
bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(c) As of the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger
and without any further action on the part of the Surviving Corporation,
NewCo or any other Person, the certificate of formation and limited liability
company agreement of NewCo in effect immediately prior to the Second Merger
Effective Time shall be the certificate of formation and limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company from and after the Second Merger
Effective Time until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Legal Requirements.

 



3 1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation; Managers and
Officers of the Surviving Company.

(a) The Parties shall take all requisite action so that, from and after
the First Merger Effective Time, until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements: (i)
the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the First Merger Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation; and (ii) the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) From and after the Second Merger Effective Time, until their successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable
Legal Requirements: (i) the managers of NewCo immediately prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time shall be the managers of the Surviving Company; and (ii)
the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company.

 

1.6 Conversion of Securities. At the First Merger Effective Time, by virtue
of the First Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

 

(a) all shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the Companys
treasury or held, directly or indirectly, by any Parent Entity immediately
prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist
and no consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof;

 

(b) except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, and subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_, _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.13_ each
share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock
that are held, directly or indirectly, by any Company Entity (other than the
Company)) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.100 of a fully paid,
validly issued and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (as such number
may be adjusted in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, the "Exchange
Ratio"); and

 

(c) each share of Merger Sub common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. __

 

1.7 Certain Adjustments. If, during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the First Merger Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur
during such period, then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action.

 

1.8 Company Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a) Effective as of the First Merger Effective Time, each Company RSU with
respect to which shares of Company Common Stock remain unvested or unissued
as of the First Merger Effective Time and each right of any kind, contingent
or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured in
whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock
granted by the Company and outstanding as of the First Merger Effective Time
(each, a "Company Stock-Based Award"), shall, in each case, be converted
automatically into a substantially similar award for, or with respect to,
Parent Common Stock, and shall remain subject to the vesting and other
conditions in effect on such date with respect to such award, except to the
extent that such vesting schedule is accelerated or otherwise affected as a
result of the Contemplated Transactions, and the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each such assumed award shall be determined by
multiplying: (i) __ the

 



4  number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time; by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock with any fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock resulting from such rounding converted into a
right to receive a cash payment calculated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
1.11_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board or a committee thereof
shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any
committee thereof with respect to each such assumed Company Stock-Based
Award.

(b) Immediately following the First Merger Effective Time, no holder of
Company Stock-Based Awards, nor any participant in any Company Equity Plan,
Company Employee Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company Entities,
or any individual party to an employment agreement or arrangement with the
Company Entities shall have any right hereunder or thereunder to acquire any
equity interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation right) or
to receive cash in respect of any equity interest in any of the Company
Entities or the Surviving Corporation. 

(c) The Company shall take further actions as may be required to cause the
conversion of each Company Stock-Based Award as is set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_ to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the
Code, as may be reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall reserve for
issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to the Company
Stock-Based Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 1.8_.

 

1.9 Treatment of Certain Company Common Stock. If any shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or
other Contract with the Company or under which the Company has any rights,
then (except to the extent provided in any binding agreement between the
Company and the holder thereof): (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition;
and (ii) the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock (or
non-certificated shares of Parent Common Stock represented by book entry
positions) may accordingly be marked or noted with appropriate legends. Prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that, from and after the First Merger Effective
Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right
set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract.

 

1.10 Treatment of Company Warrants. Effective as of the First Merger
Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to
the First Merger Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire
Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a warrant
representing a right to acquire Parent Common Stock, on substantially the
same terms and conditions as applied to such Company Warrant immediately prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, except that: (i) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each assumed Company Warrant shall
be determined by multiplying: (A) __ the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the First
Merger Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
with any fractional share of Parent Common Stock resulting from such rounding
converted into a right to receive a cash payment (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent), without interest and subject to any required Tax withholding,
determined by multiplying such fractional share of Parent Common Stock by the
closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
on the trading day immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder); and (ii) the strike price shall not be

 



5  modified; _provided, however,_ that (1) the Parent Board or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board
or any committee thereof with respect to each such assumed Company Warrant,
and (2) Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the First Merger
Effective Time, provide notice of such conversion, together with all material
terms thereof (including the number and type of the securities issuable upon
exercise) to the applicable warrant agent and the holders of the Company
Warrants. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that will be subject to the Company Warrants as a result of the actions
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.10_. In connection with the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, Parent will reasonably
cooperate with the Company with respect to the notification and related
requirements under the agreements governing the Company Warrants.

 

1.11 No Fractional Shares.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the First Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued.

(b) Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in
lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holders Company
Stock Certificate(s) or cancellation of such holders Book Entry Shares of
Company Common Stock, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent), without interest and subject to any required Tax
withholding, determined by multiplying such fractional share of Parent Common
Stock by the average closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange for the 10 most recent trading days that Parent Common
Stock has traded ending on the trading day one day prior to the Closing Date.
The Parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

1.12 Closing of Transfer Books. At the First Merger Effective Time:

 

(a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and all holders of Company Stock Certificate(s) and of
Book Entry Shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company, except the right to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ and
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13(c)_;
and

(b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect
to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
First Merger Effective Time and no further transfer of any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
First Merger Effective Time. If, after the First Merger Effective Time, a
valid Company Stock Certificate or a Book Entry Share of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share of Company Common Stock
shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section_ __ _
1.13_.

 



6 1.13 Exchange of Certificates and Cancellation of Book Entry Positions.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select Parents transfer agent
or another bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Company to act as exchange agent in the First Merger (the "Exchange Agent")
and shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to be performed by
the Exchange Agent. Prior to the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent: (i) subject to _Section_ __ _
1.9_, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_; and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.11_. The
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.13(a)_, together with any dividends
or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares
of Parent Common Stock, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."

 

(b) As soon as practicable after the First Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who were record holders
of Company Stock Certificates or holders of Book Entry Shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time: (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify and the Company shall reasonably approve prior
to the First Merger Effective Time (including a provision (A) confirming that
delivery of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Company Common
Stock shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares of
Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent, and (B) requiring certification
by the holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Company
Common Stock of their status as a U.S. citizen, as is reasonably necessary and
contemplated by the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
or cancellation of Book Entry Shares of Company Common Stock in exchange for
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ and any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13(c)_. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Exchange Agent or cancellation of Book Entry Shares of
Company Common Stock for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _
1.6_ (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 1.11_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 1.13(c))_; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share of
Company Common Stock so surrendered shall be cancelled. Until surrendered or
cancelled as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.13(b)_, each Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share of Company Common Stock shall be deemed, from
and after the First Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ (and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.11_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.13(c)_). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, shares of
Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Company Common
Stock, as applicable, so surrendered are registered, if such Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Company Common Stock, as applicable, so
surrendered are registered, shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form and with proper evidence for transfer and the person requesting
such issuance shall pay any transfer, stamp or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than
the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares
of Company Common Stock, or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. If any Company

 



7  Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in
its reasonable discretion and as a condition to the issuance of any shares of
Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a
bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the First Merger Effective Time
shall be paid or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share of Company Common Stock with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive in the First Merger until the later to occur of: (i) the date on which
the holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share of
Company Common Stock in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.13_; and (ii)
the payment date for such dividend or distribution with respect to Parent
Common Stock (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the
effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, to receive
all such dividends and distributions, without interest).

 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Company Common Stock as
of the date that is six months after the date on which the First Merger
becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand. Any holders of
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares of Company Common Stock who
have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
1.13_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and be entitled to receive
from Parent, shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ and any dividends
or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section _ 1.13(c)_.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or
other similar Legal Requirement.

1.14 Corporate Governance Matters. Unless otherwise agreed to by Parent
and the Company prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause the Parent Board, at
the First Merger Effective Time, to consist of the ten members identified on
_Schedule 1.14_ in each case to hold office from and after the First Merger
Effective Time until the earliest to occur of the appointment or election of
his or her respective successor, resignation or proper removal in accordance
with applicable Legal Requirements. Parent shall cause each of the Company
Designated Directors to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by
the Parent Board to Parents stockholders for election as directors at the
next annual meeting of Parent stockholders to occur following the First Merger
Effective Time and shall use no less rigorous efforts to solicit proxies in
favor of the Company Designated Directors than the manner in which Parent
supports all other nominees proposed by the Parent Board. Each of the Company
Designated Directors shall receive compensation from Parent for his or her
service as a director that is consistent with the compensation of other non-
employee members of the Parent Board. If, following the Closing, (i) the
Parent Board determines in good faith that including a Company Designated
Director in the slate of nominees for election as a director at the next
annual meeting in accordance with the provisions above would be a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirement, or (ii) any Company
Designated Director resigns or is unable to serve for any other reason prior
to the first anniversary following the next annual meeting (in each case, a
"Removed Designee"), then, in each case, the remaining Company Designated
Directors shall select a replacement for such Removed Designee that is
reasonably

 



8  satisfactory to the Parent Board, consistent with the standards and
processes followed by the Parent Board in connection with the appointment of
directors in accordance with past practice, including with respect to
independence requirements.

1.15 Further Action.

 

(a) If, at any time after the First Merger Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action

 

(b) If, at any time after the Second Merger Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Company to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Company with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub and the Company, the
officers, directors and member(s) (as applicable) of the Surviving Company and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Surviving Corporation, in the
name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take
such action.

1.16 Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Surviving Company and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and remitted to
the applicable Governmental Body, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

 

1.17 Conversion of Surviving Corporation Stock in the Second Merger. As of
the Second Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without
any further action on the part of the Surviving Corporation, NewCo or any
other Person, each share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

submitted, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC or any member of
its staff.

 

(b) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all material information concerning the
Company Entities required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
it is required to file, submit or furnish under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing requirements

any non-compliance with the listing requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange.

 

(c) The financial statements (including any related notes) contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i) complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the

form under the Exchange Act, and except that the unaudited financial
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments); and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results

12 (d) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and
procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company Entities; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
assets of the Company Entities that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. The Companys management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and such assessment
concluded that, as of the date thereof, such controls were effective. To

nor any of its Subsidiaries nor the Companys independent registered
accountant has identified or been made aware of: (A) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting utilized by any of the Company Entities that
would be reasonably likely to adversely affect such Company Entitys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information; (B) any
illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Companys
management or other employees; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing.

 

(e) None of the Company Entities has any obligation or other commitment to
become a party to any material "off-balance sheet arrangements" in the future.

Disclosure Schedule, between December 31, 2017 and the date of this Agreement:

 

(a) there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect, and no event
has occurred or circumstance has arisen that would, in combination with any
other events or circumstances, reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

 

(b) none of the Company Entities has: (i) declared, accrued, set aside or
paid any dividend or made any other distribution (whether in cash, stock or
otherwise) in respect of any shares of capital stock (other than dividends or

or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company); or (ii)
repurchased, redeemed or otherwise reacquired any shares of capital stock or
other securities;

 

(c) the Company has not amended or waived, in any material respect, any of
its rights under, or acted to accelerate the vesting under, any provision of
any Company RSU (whether under the Company RSU agreement or the Company
Employee Plan under which the Company RSU was granted);

 

(d) none of the Company Entities has effected or been a party to any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, reclassification of shares, stock split, reverse stock split

Requirements. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter as to its
qualified status under the Code or is a prototype or volume submitter plan
entitled, under applicable IRS guidance, to rely on the favorable opinion or

or Company Employee Agreement. Neither the terms nor the performance of any

Company Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the
financial statements of the Company in accordance with GAAP.

reflects or represents any material liability of any of the Company Entities
or any Company Affiliate to provide, post-termination or retiree life
insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-
termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason,
except: (i) as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements; (ii) benefits through the end of the month of termination of
employment; (iii) death benefits attributable to deaths occurring at or prior
to termination of employment; (iv) disability benefits attributable
to disabilities occurring at or prior to termination of employment; and (v)
conversion rights.

 

(h) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions will or could reasonably be expected to (either
alone or in combination with a termination of employment) constitute an event
under any Company Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement, trust, loan or
otherwise that will or may result in (either alone or in combination with a
termination of employment) any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
material increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to
any Company Associate.

(i) None of the Company Entities or Company Affiliates is a party to any
agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any Company

be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (or any comparable provision under state or
foreign Tax laws). No Company Entity is a party to or has any obligation
under any Contract to compensate any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant

Requirement affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or
operating units within any site of employment or facility of any of the
Company Entities that would reasonably be expected to result in any
consequences for any Company Entity under the WARN Act, except for
consequences that either individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expect not to cause a Company Material Adverse Effect.

superseded on or prior to the date of this Agreement, by the filing or

its staff.

(b) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and

processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing requirements

form under the Exchange Act, and except that the unaudited financial
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments); and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the

(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Parent Entities; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only

unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Parent
Entities that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Parents system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2017, and such assessment concluded that, as of the

involves Parents management or other employees; or (C) any claim or

or otherwise that will or may result in (either alone or in combination with

otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,

stockholders, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys stockholders,
as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement
is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of the Parties shall
promptly furnish the other Parties all information concerning such Party, its
Subsidiaries and stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_. For the
avoidance of doubt, no filing of the Form S-4 Registration Statement will be
made by Parent without providing the Company with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. If any Party becomes aware of any information that
should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, then such Party: (i) shall
promptly inform the other Party thereof; (ii) shall provide the other Party
(and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior to it being filed with the SEC; (iii) shall
provide the other Party with a copy of such amendment or supplement promptly
after it is filed with the SEC; and (iv) if mailing is appropriate, shall
cooperate in mailing such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the
Company or the stockholders of Parent.

 

(b) Prior to the First Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all other action
required to be taken under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder, or any applicable state securities or
"blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, in connection with
the issuance, exchange and listing of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
First Merger, including the Parent Common Stock to be issued upon
the exercise of converted Company Warrants and upon the vesting of converted
Company RSUs; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to
qualify to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified
or file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.

5.2 Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

(a) The Company: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable
Legal Requirements to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act, call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
Company Common Stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement (the
"Company Stockholders Meeting"); and (ii) shall submit such proposal to, and,
unless the Company Board has effected a Company Change in Recommendation
in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such proposal from, such holders at the
Company

 



58  Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any other proposals to such
holders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting (other than (x) a
customary proposal regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
and (y) a proposal to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements to
approve compensation arrangements for the Executive Officers of the Company)
without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company, in consultation
with Parent, shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to
vote at, the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not change such record
date without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company Stockholders
Meeting shall be held on a date mutually selected by the Company and Parent,
within 45 days following the date upon which the Form S-4 Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement: (A) the Company shall not postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent, other
than: (1) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is required by applicable Legal
Requirements is disclosed to the Companys stockholders within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting; or (2) if as of
the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be
conducted at the Company Stockholders Meeting, to the extent necessary to
obtain such a quorum; and (B) the Company shall adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting if Parent reasonably requests such adjournment in order
to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in
which case, the Company shall, unless the Company Board has effected a Company
Change in Recommendation in compliance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_, use its
reasonable best efforts during any such adjournment to solicit and obtain such
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to this clause "(B),"
Parent shall be entitled to request such adjournment twice and, in any event,
for no more than 7 days in each instance and in no event shall such
adjournment be extended to a date that would necessitate the Company setting
a new record date under applicable Legal Requirements. Subject to applicable
Legal Requirements: (x) the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be held
on the same date as the Parent Stockholders Meeting; and (y) if,
notwithstanding such efforts, the Parent Stockholders Meeting is held prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its meeting to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_: (i) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the Company
Board recommends that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement
at the Company Stockholders Meeting (such recommendation of the Company Board
that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement being referred
to as the "Company Board Recommendation"); (ii) the Company Board
Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Parent; and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:
(A) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (B) fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation,
or fail to publicly state that the First Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are in the best interest of the Companys
stockholders, within 10 Business Days after Parent reasonably requests (which
requests shall be limited to no more than once every 30 days) in writing
that such action be taken, (C) fail to publicly announce, within 10 Business
Days after a tender offer or exchange offer with respect to the securities of
a Company Entity shall have been commenced by the filing of a Schedule TO with
respect thereto, a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (D) fail to issue, within 10
Business Days following a request by Parent after an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to a Company Entity is publicly announced, a press release announcing
its opposition to such

 



59  Acquisition Proposal; or (E) resolve or publicly propose to take any action
described in clauses "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this sentence (each of the foregoing
actions described in clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)" being referred to as a
"Company Change in Recommendation").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may
effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may be, a Company Change
in Recommendation and not include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (which shall constitute a Company Change in
Recommendation):

 

(i) if: (A) the Company has not materially breached its obligations under 
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ in connection with the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in the following clause "(B);" (B) after the
date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (C) the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Company Superior Offer; (D) the Company Board does not effect, or cause the
Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation at any time within five
Business Days after Parent receives written notice from the
Company confirming that the Company Board has determined that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Company Superior Offer (together with a written
summary of the Company Superior Offer and setting forth the identity of the
Person making such Company Superior Offer and all the material terms and
conditions of such Company Superior Offer in reasonable detail) (it being
understood and agreed that any revision or modification in any material
respect to such Company Superior Offer after such written notice shall
require a new written notice by the Company to Parent in compliance with this
clause "(D)" and a new matching period under clause "(E)" below, except that
such written notice and matching period shall be three Business Days); (E)
during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company
engages in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives and
directs its financial advisors and outside legal advisors to engage in good
faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives, the intent and
purpose of which is to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a Company Superior
Offer no longer constitutes a Company Superior Offer, so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected; (F) at the end of such five
Business Day period, such offer has not been withdrawn and continues to
constitute a Company Superior Offer (taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations
required by clause "(E)" or otherwise); and (G) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that,
in light of such Company Superior Offer, the failure to make a Company Change
in Recommendation could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements; or

(ii) if: (A) a material development or change in circumstances that is not
related to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to a Company Entity occurs or
arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known by, nor reasonably
foreseeable to, the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (such
material development or change in circumstances being referred to as a
"Company Intervening Event"); (B) at least seven Business Days prior to making
a Company Change in Recommendation, the Company provides Parent with
a written notice specifying the material information with respect to such
Company Intervening Event and that it intends to make a Company Change in
Recommendation; (C) during such seven Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives and directs its financial advisors and outside legal advisors
to engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives, to
amend this Agreement in such a 

 



60  manner that obviates the need for the Company Board to effect, or cause the
Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation as a result of such
Company Intervening Event; and (D) at the end of such seven Business Day
period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after having consulted
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Intervening
Event, the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation could
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the holders of the Companys Common Stock at
the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of
this Agreement and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of such obligation.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Company Board or any
committee thereof from: (i) issuing any "stop-look-and-listen" communication
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act; (ii) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; or
(iii) if required by applicable Legal Requirements, issuing a press release
disclosing that the Company has received a bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board has determined in compliance with  _Section_
__ _ 4.4(a)_ could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior
Offer ( _provided_ , that (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
material breach of _Section_ __ _ 4.4_, and (B) the Company provides Parent,
at least one Business Day prior to release of such press release, a copy of
such press release); _provided_ , that, in the case of clause "(ii)" and
"(iii)" of this sentence, any such disclosure shall be deemed to be a
withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation if the Company
Board fails to expressly and publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure or communication.

(a) Parent: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal

such efforts, the Company Stockholders Meeting is held prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

date of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_: (i) the Joint Proxy

Acquisition Proposal referred to in the following clause "(B);" (B) after the
date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition

maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Company Stock-Based Awards remain
outstanding and are required to be registered.

 

(b) At the First Merger Effective Time, Parent may (if Parent determines
that it desires to do so) assume any or all of the Company Equity Plans. If
Parent elects to assume a Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity
Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent
permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of
such Company Equity Plan as of the First Merger Effective Time (including any
shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of
Company Stock-Based Awards that are assumed and converted by Parent pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 1.8_), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards
shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company
Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common
Stock by the Exchange Ratio and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the Parent
Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility
of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to the
administration of such Company Equity Plan. 

(c) Prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all
action that may be necessary (under any Company Equity Plan and otherwise) to
effectuate the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ and to ensure that, from and
after the First Merger Effective Time, holders of Company Stock-Based Awards
have only those rights with respect thereto specifically provided in
_Section_ __ _ 1.8_.

5.5 Employee Benefits.

(a) For a period of at least one year following the First Merger Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Company and any of its Subsidiaries) to (i) provide each Continuing
Employee with a base salary or wage rate and cash incentive opportunities that
are no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and cash incentive
opportunities

 



64  provided to similarly situated Parent Associates, and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee with retirement, welfare, and severance benefit plans,
programs, arrangements and agreements, including with respect to historic
funding and contribution levels, that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to those provided to similarly situated Parent Associates.

 

(b) All service of the Continuing Employees shall be recognized for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual and
level of benefits, other than in respect of accrual and level of benefits
under a defined benefit pension plan, with respect to each Parent Employee
Plan in which any Continuing Employee participates after the First Merger
Effective Time to the same extent such service was recognized under the
analogous Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time, except to the extent such recognition would result in the
duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent or Parents Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), as applicable,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Employee Plan
that is a welfare benefit plan to: (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, actively-at-work requirements, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements other than
preexisting condition limitations, actively-at-work requirements, exclusions
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to each Continuing
Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents and that have
not been satisfied or waived as of the First Merger Effective Time under the
analogous welfare benefit plan maintained for such Continuing Employee and his
or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents immediately prior to the First
Merger Effective Time; and (ii) recognize for each Continuing Employee and his
or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents for purposes of applying annual
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Employee
Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the
Continuing Employee or his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents
under an analogous Company Employee Plan during the plan year of such plan in
which occurs the later of the First Merger Effective Time and the date on
which the Continuing Employee begins participation in such Parent Employee
Plan.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to create: (i) a right in any
Company Associate to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent or any Parent Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the
extent prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements or expressly provided
otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates and the Continuing Employee; or (ii) other than
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_ with respect to any Company Associate, or any other
Person other than the Parties, any third-party rights, benefits or remedies of
any nature whatsoever. Nothing herein shall constitute an amendment to any
Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement or Parent Employee Plan or
Parent Employee Agreement or be construed to limit the right of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any
Parent Employee Plan, any Company Employee Plan or any other employee benefit
plan in accordance with its terms and applicable Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall create any third party rights in any current
or former service provider of the Company or any of Company Affiliates (or
any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) and nothing in this _Section_ __ _
5.5_ shall limit the scope and effectiveness of _Section_ __ _ 5.6_.

 

(d) The Parties shall cooperate with one another to determine whether any
Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended
to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "401(k) Plan") will be
terminated effective prior to the First Merger Effective Time. If the Company
is required to terminate any 401(k) Plan as a result of such cooperation,
then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written
evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of resolutions authorizing the
termination of such 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions
shall be subject to the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



65 (e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements
are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any of the
Contemplated Transactions, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to ensure
that such requirements are complied with prior to the First Merger Effective
Time.

 

(f) The Company and the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
further resolutions, deliver any required notices, and take all further
actions that are necessary to cause (i) the Companys Deferred Compensation
Plan (the "DCP"), the rabbi trust associated with the DCP, and the GulfMark
Offshore, Inc. 2015 Share Incentive Plan (the "UK ESPP") to be terminated,
(ii) all payments, distributions and share issuances in respect of deferred or
contributed amounts under the DCP and the UK ESPP to be made, distributed,
issued or otherwise finally settled, in each case, effective prior to the
First Merger Effective Time and in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements and the terms of such documents. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide to Parent (i) written evidence of the adoption by the
Company Board of resolutions authorizing the termination of the DCP and its
associated rabbi trust and the UK ESPP, and (ii) documentary evidence of the
termination of such plans and trusts and final settlement of all obligations
thereunder, in each case of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)", in accordance with Legal

5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the First Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and from and
after the Second Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries, to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, the current or former directors and officers and
any person who becomes a director or officer of any of the Company Entities
prior to the First Merger Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") to the
fullest extent that applicable Legal Requirements permit such company to
indemnify its own directors and officers. For six years after the First Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect
the provisions in (i) the organizational documents of each Company Entity;
and (ii) any other agreements of any Company Entity with any of Indemnified
Parties, in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are
in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such provision shall be
amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
First Merger Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions).

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, for a period of six years following the
First Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation or
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall cause to be maintained in effect the
existing policy of the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
(or a comparable replacement policy) (the "DandO Policy") covering claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the First Merger
Effective Time to the extent that such claims are of the type covered by the
DandO Policy (and including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to the extent
such acts or omissions are covered by the DandO Policy) and covering each
Indemnified Party who is covered as of the First Merger Effective Time by the
DandO Policy, in any case on terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are
no less favorable in the aggregate to the insured persons than those terms in
effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to

 



66  expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the larger of the
current annual premium paid by the Company (which annual premium is set forth
on Part 5.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the
larger such 250% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"); and _provided further_
, _however_ , that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds
the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest comparable coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated
under the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_, Parent shall cause
to be purchased prior to Closing and, upon Parents consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall be
entitled to purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Policy on
terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate
to the insured persons than the DandO Policy, and in the event that Parent or
the Company shall purchase such a "tail" policy, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Surviving Company, as applicable, shall maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation or Surviving Company, as applicable, in
lieu of all other applicable obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation or Surviving Company, as applicable, under the first sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) The obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under
the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ and
any of such persons heirs and representatives) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ (and, after the death of any of the foregoing persons,
such persons heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ (and, after the death of any of the
foregoing persons, such persons heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy
referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirements (whether
at law or in equity).

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
successors or assigns) shall (i) consolidate or merge with any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer or convey all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then in each case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable) shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_.

5.7 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

(a) Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as soon
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and
other documents required to be filed by such Party with any Governmental Body
with respect to the Mergers and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to
submit as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any additional
information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall, promptly after the
date of this Agreement, prepare and file any notifications required under any

 



67  Legal Requirement in connection with the Mergers in the United States of
America that is designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively,

use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
and advisable to any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney
general, antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with
antitrust or related matters. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate
the Mergers and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions.

(b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality

(including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its
obligations set forth in) _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, Parent shall (i) have the principal responsibility for devising
and implementing the strategy of the Parties with respect to seeking any
actions or Consents of any Governmental Body with respect to the Mergers and
coordinating any contacts, where permitted, with any Governmental Body; and
(ii) take the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental
Body in connection with obtaining any such action or Consent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements or
any Governmental Body (in which case, the Parties shall take appropriate
actions to address such prohibitions, such as redacting documents or providing
on an "outside counsel basis only"), and subject to the
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company shall: (A) consult with the other in good faith prior to
taking a position with respect to any such filing; (B) permit the other to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or
submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of
any Party in connection with any Legal Proceeding related solely to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions (including any such Legal
Proceeding relating to any antitrust, competition or fair trade Legal
Requirement); (C) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such
information; and (D) promptly provide the other Parties (and their counsel)
with copies of all filings, notices, analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, white papers, opinions, proposals and other submissions (and a
summary of any oral presentations) made or submitted by such Party with or to
any Governmental Body related solely to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of: (i) any material communication from any official of any
Governmental Body in connection with any filing made pursuant to this
Agreement; (ii) knowledge of the commencement or threat of commencement of any

status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat); and (iii) any request by any
official of any Governmental Body for any amendment or supplement to
any filing made pursuant to this Agreement or any information required to
comply with any Legal Requirements applicable to the Contemplated
Transactions. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.7(a)_, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall (promptly upon
learning of the occurrence of such event) inform the other of the occurrence
of such event and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Body
such amendment or supplement.

(d) In furtherance of the foregoing, if such actions are required by a
Governmental Body in order to satisfy the condition set forth in Section
6.1(c), the obligations of Parent and the Company under this _Section_ __ _
5.7_ shall include agreeing to: (i) dispose of, transfer or exclusively
license, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of, transfer or
exclusively license, any assets to any Person, or to

 



68  commit to (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to commit to) dispose of,

(or cause any of its Subsidiaries to commit to) make any commitment (to any

operations of any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that such actions do not
have a materially adverse impact on the benefits that Parent expects to
recognize in connection with the Contemplated Transaction; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to hold separate or to divest
any of the material businesses, services or properties or assets of either
Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand.

the Parent Entities to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire
any assets, business or any Person, whether by merger, consolidation,
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any Person or
by any other manner or engage in any other transaction or take any other
action, if the entering into of an agreement relating to or the consummation
of such acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other transaction or
action would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any
delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorization, consent, clearance, approval or order of a Governmental Body
necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any approvals and expiration of waiting periods
pursuant to the Antitrust Laws or any other applicable Legal Requirements, or
