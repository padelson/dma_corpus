Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by 1.0383 (rounded to the nearest whole share) under the

Options, the " _Rollover Awards_ "). Each Rollover RSU shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting, expiration and

right to receive the Longview Common Stock to which such share of Company
Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(viii)_.

  



  

(h)  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers of Company Stock that

(i)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed

Company Stockholder who has not exchanged his, her or its Company Stock for
the applicable Longview Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.5_
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Longview for the issuance of
the applicable Longview Common Stock, without any interest thereon. None of
Longview, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, unclaimed property,
escheat, or similar Law. Any Longview Common Stock remaining unclaimed by the
Company Stockholders immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Longview
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

Section 2.6   _Withholding_. Longview, the Group Companies, the
Exchange Agent and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld under applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Other than in respect of any compensatory
payment subject to payroll withholding, the Parties shall cooperate in good
faith to eliminate or reduce any such deduction or withholding (including
through the request and provision of any statements, forms or other documents
to reduce or eliminate any such deduction or withholding).

  



  

Section 2.7   _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by a holder who is entitled
to demand and has properly demanded appraisal of such shares in accordance
with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive Longview Common Stock, and shall instead represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective
Time, (a) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, extinguished and cease to
exist and (b) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such holder's right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive Longview
Common Stock upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement applicable to holders that have not properly demanded appraisal
rights. The Company shall give Longview prompt notice (and in any event
within two Business Days) of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and
Longview shall have the right to participate in and, following the
Effective Time, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Longview, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise comply
with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree or commit to do
any of the foregoing.

the Longview Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall give counsel for the Company (in the case of any Longview Party) or
Longview (in the case of the Company), a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents. Each of the Parties agrees not to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unless it consults with, in the case of any Longview Party, the Company, or,
in the case of the Company, Longview in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives, in the case of any
Longview Party, the Company, or, in the case of the Company, Longview, the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement,
in the event that this _Section 5.2_ conflicts with any other covenant or

control solely to the extent of such conflict.

  



  

(d)  From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier

Longview, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall each

thereto (collectively, the " _Transaction Litigation_ ") commenced against,
in the case of Longview, any of the Longview Parties or any of their
respective Representatives (in their capacity as a representative of an
Longview Party) or, in the case of the Company, any Group Company or any of
their respective Representatives (in their capacity as a representative of an
Longview Party). Longview and the Company shall each (i) keep the other
reasonably informed regarding any Transaction Litigation, (ii) give the other

other Group Company or any of their respective Representatives settle or
compromise any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of
Longview (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, 
_provided_ that it shall be deemed to be reasonable for Longview to withhold,
condition or delay its consent if any such settlement or compromise (A) does
not provide for a legally binding, full, unconditional and irrevocable release
of each Longview Party and Representative that is the subject of such
Transaction Litigation, (B) provides for (x) the payment of cash any portion
of which is payable by any Longview Party or Representative thereof or would
otherwise constitute an Longview Liability or (y) any non-
monetary, injunctive, equitable or similar relief against any Longview Party

or any of its Representatives). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall Longview, any of the Longview Parties or any of

this Agreement, in the event that this _Section 5.3(a)_ or either

of the Group Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal
business operations of the Group Companies). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Group Companies shall be required to provide to Longview or any of
its Representatives any information (i) if and to the extent doing so would
(A) violate any Law to which any Group Company is subject, including any
Privacy Law, (B) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties in breach of any Contract with such third party, (C) violate any
legally-binding obligation of any Group Company with respect to
confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy or (D) jeopardize protections
afforded to any Group Company under the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine ( _provided_  that, in case of each of
_clauses (A)_ through _(D)_ , the Company shall, and shall cause the other
Group Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) provide such
access as can be provided (or otherwise convey such information regarding the
applicable matter as can be conveyed) without violating such privilege,
doctrine, Contract, obligation or Law and (y) provide such information in a

is reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ that the Company shall, in the
case of _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ , provide prompt written notice of the
withholding of access or information on any such basis.

  



  

(c)  From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable advance written notice,
Longview shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Company and its
Representatives during normal business hours reasonable access to the
directors, officers, books and records of the Longview Parties (in a manner
so as to not interfere with the normal business operations of the Longview
Parties). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Longview shall not be required to
provide, or cause to be provided to, the Company or any of its Representatives
any information (i) if and to the extent doing so would (A) violate any Law
to which any Longview Party is subject, (B) result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties in breach of any Contract with such third
party, (C) violate any legally-binding obligation of any Longview Party with
respect to confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy or (D) jeopardize

the applicable matter as can be conveyed) without violating such privilege,
doctrine, Contract, obligation or Law and (y) provide such information in
a manner without violating such privilege, doctrine, Contract, obligation or
Law), or (ii) if an Longview Party, on the one hand, and any Group Company,
any Company Non-Party Affiliate or any of their respective Representatives, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such information is
reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ that Longview shall, in the case of

5.8_, none of the Parties or any of their respective Representatives shall
issue any press releases or make any public announcements with respect to this

consent of, prior to the Closing, the Company and Longview or, after the
Closing, Longview; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Party may make any such
announcement or other communication (i) if such announcement or other
communication is required by applicable Law, in which case (A) prior to the
Closing, the disclosing Party and its Representatives shall use reasonable
best efforts to consult with the Company, if the disclosing party is any
Longview Party, or Longview, if the disclosing party is the Company, to
review such announcement or communication and the opportunity to comment
thereon and the disclosing Party shall consider such comments in good faith,
or (B) after the Closing, the disclosing Party and its Representatives shall
use reasonable best efforts to consult with Longview and the disclosing Party
shall consider such comments in good faith, (ii) to the extent such
announcements or other communications contain only information previously

previously approved in accordance with this _Section 5.4_ and (iii) to
Governmental Entities in connection with any Consents required to be made
under this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or in connection with the

(b)  The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release in the form
agreed by the Company and Longview prior to the execution of this Agreement
and such initial press release (the " _Signing Press Release_ ") shall be
released as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement on the day thereof. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement,
Longview shall file a current report on Form 8-K (the " _Signing Filing_ ")
with the Signing Press Release and a description of this Agreement as required
by, and in compliance with, the Securities Laws, which the Company shall have
the opportunity to review and comment upon prior to filing and Longview shall
consider such comments in good faith. The Company, on the one hand, and
Longview, on the other hand, shall mutually agree upon (such agreement not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by either the Company or
Longview, as applicable) a press release announcing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing Press Release_ ")
prior to the Closing, and, on the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause the
Closing Press Release to be released. Promptly after the Closing (but in any
event within four (4) Business Days after the Closing), Longview shall file a
current report on Form 8-K (the " _Closing Filing_ ") with the Closing Press
Release and a description of the Closing as required by Securities Laws. In
connection with the preparation of each of the Signing Press Release, the
Signing Filing, the Closing Press Release and the Closing Filing, each Party

Section 5.5   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Tax Treatment_.

  



  

(i)  The Parties intend that the Transactions shall be treated as a
transaction that qualifies under Section 351(a) of the Code or that the
Merger shall be treated as a transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and each Party shall, and
shall cause its respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to so
qualify. The Parties shall file all Tax Returns consistent with, and take no
position inconsistent with (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise), the
treatment described in this _Section 5.5(a)(i)_ unless required to do so
pursuant to a "determination" that is final within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if,
after the date hereof but prior to the time at which the Required Longview
Stockholder Approval has been obtained Longview and the Company mutually
determine in good faith that the Transactions are not expected to qualify as a
transaction under Section 351(a) of the Code and that the Merger is not
reasonably expected to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to restructure the transactions contemplated hereby
(such restructured transactions, the " _Alternative Transaction Structure_ ")
in a manner that is reasonably expected to cause the Alternative Transaction
Structure to so qualify, including by adding a second merger to take place
immediately after the Merger whereby the surviving company in the Merger
would merge with and into a new limited liability company that is a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Longview (" _Newco_ "), with Newco being the surviving
company in such merger.

  



  

(ii)  Longview and the Company hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). From the date hereof through the Closing, and
following the Closing, the Parties shall not, and shall not permit or cause
their respective Affiliates to, take any action, or knowingly fail to take any
action, which action or failure to act prevents or impedes, or would
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger qualifying for the
Intended Tax Treatment.

  



  

(iii)  If, in connection with the preparation and filing of the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, the SEC requests or requires that
tax opinions be prepared and submitted in such connection, Longview and the
Company shall deliver to Ropes and Gray LLP and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,
Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., respectively, customary Tax representation letters
satisfactory to each counsel (the " _Tax Letters_ "), dated and executed as
of the date the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement shall have been
declared effective by the SEC and such other date(s) as determined reasonably
necessary by such counsel in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, and, if required, Mintz, Levin,
Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. shall furnish an opinion, subject to
customary assumptions and limitations and receipt of the Tax Letters, to the
effect that the Intended Tax Treatment should apply to the Merger.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b)   _Tax Matters Cooperation_. Each of the Parties shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by another Party, in connection with the filing of
relevant Tax Returns, and any audit or tax proceeding.

  



  

(c)   _Transfer Taxes_. The Surviving Company shall be responsible
for any sales, use, real property transfer, stamp or other similar transfer
Taxes imposed in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage (including by means of furnishing or disclosing
information), facilitate, discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, any
inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) with respect to a Company

participate in, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by
any Person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing. The Company agrees to
(A) notify Longview promptly upon receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal
by any Group Company, and to describe the material terms and conditions of
any such Company Acquisition Proposal in reasonable detail (including the
identity of the Persons making such Company Acquisition Proposal) and (B)
keep Longview reasonably informed on a current basis of any modifications
to such offer or information.

  



  

(b)  From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Longview Parties shall not, and each of them shall cause their

encourage (including by means of furnishing or disclosing information),
facilitate, discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, any inquiry,
proposal or offer (written or oral) with respect to an Longview Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information to any Person

knowingly facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to do
or seek to do any of the foregoing. Longview agrees to (A) notify the
Company promptly upon receipt of any Longview Acquisition Proposal by any
Longview Party, and to describe the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal in reasonable detail (including the identity of any
person or entity making such Longview Acquisition Proposal) and (B) keep the
Company reasonably informed on a current basis of any modifications to such
offer or information.

to the other all information concerning such Party, its Non-Party Affiliates
and their respective Representatives that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 5.7_
or for including in any other statement, filing, notice or application made by
or on behalf of Longview to the SEC or the NYSE in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents, including delivering customary tax representation letters to

Longview Party, the Company, or, in the case of the Company,
Longview, thereof; (ii) such Party shall prepare and mutually agree upon

Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement is
initially filed with the SEC, at each time at which it is amended, or at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. From and
after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Longview
Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall give
counsel for the Company (in the case of any Longview Party) or Longview (in

(D) if the holders of Longview Class A Common Stock have elected to redeem a
number of Class A Common Stock as of such time that would reasonably be

satisfied; _provided_  that, without the consent of the Company, in no event
shall Longview adjourn the Longview Stockholders Meeting for more than
fifteen (15) Business Days later than the most recently adjourned meeting or

exculpation now existing in favor of the directors and officers of each
Longview Party, as provided in the applicable Longview Party's Governing
Documents or otherwise in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective

to the Effective Time shall survive the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect from and after the
Effective Time for a period of six (6) years and (ii) Longview will perform

Longview shall advance, or caused to be advanced, expenses in connection with
such indemnification as provided in the applicable Longview Party's Governing
Documents or other applicable agreements as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time. The indemnification and liability limitation or
exculpation provisions of the Longview Parties' Governing Documents shall
not, during such six (6)-year period, be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would
materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, or at any time prior to such
time, were directors or officers of any Longview Party (the " _Longview DandO
Persons_") entitled to be so indemnified, have their liability limited or be
exculpated with respect to any matters occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time and relating to the fact that such Longview DandO Person was a director or
officer of any Longview Party immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless
such amendment, repeal or other modification is required by applicable Law.

  



  

(b)  Longview shall not have any obligation under this _Section
5.14_ to any Longview DandO Person when and if a court of competent

DandO Person in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(c)  For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Longview shall maintain, without any lapses in coverage, directors' and
officers' liability insurance for the benefit of those Persons who
are currently covered by any comparable insurance policies of the Longview
Parties as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring on
or prior to the Effective Time. Such insurance policies shall provide coverage
on terms (with respect to coverage and amount) that are substantially the
same as (and no less favorable in the aggregate to the insured than) the
coverage provided under Longview's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies as of the date of this Agreement. Alternatively, Longview

that affords coverage which is comparable to Longview's existing directors'

have their liability limited or be exculpated with respect to any
matters occurring prior to Closing and relating to the fact that such Company
DandO Person was a director or officer of any Group Company prior to the

(b)  None of Longview or the Group Companies shall have any
obligation under this _Section 5.15_ to any Company DandO Person when and if a

liability insurance policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that
none of the Company, Longview or any of their respective Affiliates shall pay
a premium for such "tail" policy in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the most recent annual premium paid by the Group Companies prior to the date
of this Agreement and, in such event, the Company, Longview or one of their
respective Affiliates shall purchase the maximum coverage available for three

Company Disclosure Schedules or in the Longview Disclosure Schedules
corresponding to any Section or subsection of _Article 3_ (in the case of

Disclosure Schedules) shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to
every other section and subsection of _Article 3_ (in the case of

Law, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the

acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are

Schedules or _Section 8.12(b)_ of the Longview Disclosure Schedules shall
have any personal Liability or obligations regarding such knowledge.

  



  

Section 8.13   _No Recourse_. Except for claims pursuant to any
Ancillary Document by any party(ies) thereto against any Company Non-Party
Affiliate or any Longview Non-Party Affiliate (each, a " _Non-Party
Affiliate_ "), and then solely with respect to claims against the Non-Party
Affiliates that are party to the applicable Ancillary Document, each Party
agrees on behalf of itself and on behalf of the Company Non-Party Affiliates,
in the case of the Company, and the Longview Non-Party Affiliates, in the case
of Longview, that (a) this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
action for breach of this Agreement may only be made against, the Parties, and
no claims of any nature whatsoever arising under or relating to this
Agreement, the negotiation hereof or its subject matter, or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be asserted against any Non-Party
Affiliate, and (b) none of the Non-Party Affiliates shall have any Liability

any of the agreements or conditions set forth herein. Any agreement on the
part of any such Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if

of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  



  

   

85

 



    



  

Section 8.15   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF

HERETO OR THERETO OR ANY FINANCING IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS

BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _Section 8.15_.

  



  

Section 8.16   _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction, any state or federal court
within State of New York, New York County), for the purposes of any
Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action (a) arising under this
Agreement or under any Ancillary Document or (b) in any way connected with or
related or incidental to the dealings of the Parties in respect of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, and irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
Proceeding in any such court, and further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding claim,
demand, action or cause of action against such Party (i) arising under this
Agreement or under any Ancillary Document or (ii) in any way connected with
or related or incidental to the dealings of the Parties in respect of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, (A) any claim that
such Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts as
described in this _Section 8.16_ for any reason, (B) that such Party or such
Party's property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court
or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service
of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (C) that (x) the
Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action in any such court is
brought against such Party in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such
Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action against such Party is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced against such Party in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered mail to
such party's respective address set forth in _Section 8.4_ shall be

or cause of action.

  



  

   

86

 



    



  

Section 8.17   _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity
upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform
their respective obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without posting a bond or
undertaking and without proof of damages and this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  



  

Section 8.18   _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final
prospectus of Longview, filed with the SEC (File Nos. 333-237960) on May 22,
2020 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company acknowledges and agrees and
understands that Longview has established a trust account (the "
_Trust Account_ ") containing the proceeds of its initial public offering
(the " _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously
with the IPO (including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the
benefit of Longview's public stockholders (including overallotment shares
acquired by Longview's underwriters, the " _Public Stockholders_ "), and
Longview may disburse monies from the Trust Account only in the express
circumstances described in the Prospectus. For and in consideration of
Longview entering into this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself and
its Representatives that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company nor any of it Representatives
does now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions
therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result
of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any
proposed or actual business relationship between Longview or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and, the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to
hereafter as the " _Trust Account Released Claims_"). The Company, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Representatives, hereby irrevocably waives any
Trust Account Released Claims that it or any of its Representatives may have
against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in
the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, or Contracts
with Longview or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the
Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason
whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of any agreement with Longview or
its Affiliates).

of shares of New Butterfly Class A common stock will be entitled to cast one
vote per share of New Butterfly Class A common stock and holders of shares of
New Butterfly Class B common stock will be entitled to cast 20 votes per
share of New Butterfly Class B common stock on each matter properly submitted
to New Butterfly's stockholders entitled to vote, as opposed to the Current
Charter, which provides that each share of Longview Class A common stock and
Longview Class B common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter
properly submitted to Longview's stockholders entitled to vote;

  



  

Advisory Charter Amendment Proposal C - Under the Proposed Charter, any
action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of New Butterfly
may be taken by written consent until the time the issued and outstanding
shares of New Butterfly Class B common stock represent less than 50% of the
voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of New
Butterfly that would be entitled to vote for the election of directors, as
opposed to the Bylaws of Longview, which permit holders of Longview capital
stock to take stockholder action by written consent;

  



  

Advisory Charter Amendment Proposal D - Amendments to certain provisions of
the Proposed Charter relating to the rights of New Butterfly Class A common
stock and New Butterfly Class B common stock will require (i) so long as any
shares of New Butterfly Class B common stock remain outstanding, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of New Butterfly Class B common stock, voting as a
separate class, (ii) so long as any shares of New Butterfly Class A
common stock remain outstanding, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of New Butterfly Class A common stock,
voting as a separate class, and (iii) the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the then outstanding capital stock of New
Butterfly entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, as opposed to the Current Charter, which only
requires such an amendment to be approved by stockholders in accordance
with Delaware law (except that, prior to Longview's initial business
combination, amendments to those provisions of the Current Charter relating
to an initial business combination require the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 65% of shares of Longview Class A common stock and Longview Class
B common stock (collectively, " _Longview common stock_ ") then outstanding);

  



  

   



 



    



  

Advisory Charter Amendment Proposal E - The New Butterfly Bylaws may be
amended, altered or repealed or adopted either (x) by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the board of directors of New Butterfly (the " _New Butterfly
Board_ ") present at any regular or special meeting of the New Butterfly
Board at which a quorum is present or (y) (i) when outstanding New Butterfly
Class B common stock represents less than 50% of the voting power of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of New Butterfly that would be entitled
to vote for the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least two-thirds of the voting power of the capital stock of New Butterfly
that would be entitled to vote in the election of directors or, prior to such
time, (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of the outstanding capital stock of New Butterfly that would be
entitled to vote in the election of directors, as opposed to the Bylaws of
Longview, which may be amended by the approval of a majority of the board of
directors of Longview (the " _Longview Board_ ") or by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of
Longview common stock entitled to vote general in the election of directors;

  



  

Advisory Charter Amendment Proposal F - The Proposed Charter provides that
the number of directors will be fixed and may be modified by the New
Butterfly Board, provided that the number of directors cannot exceed a certain
threshold without the affirmative vote of the holders of (x) at least two-
thirds of the voting power of the capital stock of New Butterfly that
would be entitled to vote in the election of directors when outstanding New
Butterfly Class B common stock represents less than 50% of the voting power
of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of New Butterfly that would be
entitled to vote for the election of directors, or, prior to such time, (y) a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of New Butterfly
that would be entitled to vote in the election of directors, as opposed to

Shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be treated equally, identically and ratably, on a per share basis, with respect to any dividends or distributions as may be declared and paid from time to time by the Board out of any assets of the Corporation legally available therefor; _provided, however_ , that in the event a dividend is paid in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (or rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such shares), then holders of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive shares of Class A Common Stock (or rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such shares, as the case may be), and holders of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive shares of Class B Common Stock (or rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such shares, as the case may be), with holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock receiving, on a per share basis, an identical number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (or rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such shares, as the case may be), as applicable.

6.   _Certain Transactions_.

  



  

6.1   _Merger or Consolidation_. In the case of any distribution
or payment in respect of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common

consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other entity,

Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock have the right to receive, or
the right to elect to receive, shall be made ratably on a per share basis
among the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as a
single class; _provided, however_ , that shares of such classes may receive,
or have the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate
distribution, payment or consideration in connection with such consolidation,
merger or other transaction in order to reflect the special rights, powers and
privileges of holders of shares of Class B Common Stock under this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may include,
without limitation, securities distributable to the holders of, or issuable
upon the conversion of, each share of Class B Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such transaction having not more than twenty (20) times
the voting power of any securities distributable to the holders of, or
issuable upon the conversion of, each share of Class A Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such transaction or any other share of stock

Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock than those
contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

6.2   _Third-Party Tender or Exchange Offers_. The Corporation
may not enter into any agreement pursuant to which a third party may by
tender or exchange offer acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock unless the holders of (a) the Class A Common Stock shall have
the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of
consideration and the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as

receive, or the right to elect to receive, the same form of consideration and

_provided, however_ , that shares of such classes may receive, or have the
right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate consideration in
connection with such tender or exchange offer in order to reflect the special
rights, powers and privileges of the holders of shares of the Class B Common
Stock under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which may
include, without limitation, securities exchangeable for each share of
Class B Common Stock having twenty (20) times the voting power of any
securities exchangeable for each share of Class A Common Stock or any other
share of stock then outstanding) or such other rights, powers, privileges or
other terms that are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the holders of
the Class B Common Stock relative to the holders of the Class A Common Stock

7.   _Conversion_.

  



  

7.1   _Optional Conversion of Class B Common Stock_. Each share
of Class B Common Stock shall be convertible into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder
thereof at any time upon written notice to the Corporation (an " _Optional
Class B Conversion Event_ "). Before any holder of Class B Common Stock
shall be entitled to convert any shares of Class B Common Stock into shares
of Class A Common Stock, such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor (if any), duly endorsed, at the principal corporate
office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Class B Common
Stock, and shall provide written notice to the Corporation at its principal
corporate office, of such conversion election and shall state therein the
name or names (i) in which the certificate or certificates representing the
shares of Class A Common Stock into which the shares of Class B Common Stock
are so converted are to be issued (if such shares of Class A Common Stock are
certificated) or (ii) in which such shares of Class A Common Stock are to be
registered in book-entry form (if such shares of Class A Common Stock are
uncertificated). If the shares of Class A Common Stock into which the shares
of Class B Common Stock are to be converted are to be issued in a name or
names other than the name of the holder of the shares of Class B Common Stock
being converted, such notice shall be accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the holder. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder, or to the
nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates representing
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock to which such holder shall be
entitled upon such conversion (if such shares of Class A Common Stock are
certificated) or shall register such shares of Class A Common Stock in book-
entry form (if such shares of Class A Common Stock are uncertificated). Such
conversion shall be deemed to be effective immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Class B Common Stock
to be converted following or contemporaneously with the provision of
written notice of such conversion election as required by this Subsection
7.1, the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall
be deemed to be outstanding as of such time, and the Person or Persons
entitled to receive the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion shall be deemed to be the record holder or holders of such shares
of Class A Common Stock as of such time. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, shares of Class B Common Stock represented by a lost, stolen or
destroyed stock certificate may be converted pursuant to an Optional Class B
Conversion Event if the holder thereof notifies the Corporation or its
transfer agent that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and
makes an affidavit of that fact acceptable to the Corporation and executes an
agreement acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any
loss incurred by it in connection with such certificate.

7.2   _Automatic Conversion of Class B Common Stock_. To the
extent set forth below, each applicable share of Class B Common Stock shall
automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class
A Common Stock upon the occurrence of an event described below (a "
_Mandatory Class B Conversion Event_ "):

  



  

(a)   _Transfers_. Each share of Class B Common Stock that is
subject to a Transfer (as defined in Section 11), other than a Permitted
Transfer (as defined in Section 11), shall automatically, without further
action by the Corporation or the holder thereof, convert into one (1) fully
paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon the occurrence of
such Transfer (other than a Permitted Transfer).

  



  

(b)   _Reduction in Voting Power_. Each outstanding share of
Class B Common Stock shall automatically, without further action by the
Corporation or the holder thereof, convert into one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon the first date on which the
Founder, together with all other Qualified Stockholders, collectively cease to
beneficially own at least 20% of the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
(as such number of shares is equitably adjusted in respect of any
reclassification, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or
recapitalization of the Class B Common Stock) collectively held by the Founder
and his Permitted Transferees as of the Effective Date.

  



  

(c)   _Affirmative Vote_. Each outstanding share of Class B
Common Stock shall automatically, without further action by the Corporation
or the holder thereof, convert into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share
of Class A Common Stock upon the date specified by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of
Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class.

  



  

7.3   _Certificates_. Each outstanding stock certificate (if
shares are in certificated form) that, immediately prior to the occurrence of
a Mandatory Class B Conversion Event, represented one or more shares of Class
B Common Stock subject to such Mandatory Class B Conversion Event shall, upon
such Mandatory Class B Conversion Event, be deemed to represent an equal
number of shares of Class A Common Stock, without the need for surrender or
exchange thereof. The Corporation shall, upon the request of any holder whose
shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A
Common Stock as a result of an Optional Class B Conversion Event or a
Mandatory Class B Conversion Event (either of the foregoing, a " _Conversion
Event_ ") and upon surrender by such holder to the Corporation of the
outstanding certificate(s) formerly representing such holder's shares of
Class B Common Stock, if any (or, in the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon such holder providing an affidavit of that fact acceptable
to the Corporation and executing an agreement acceptable to the Corporation to
indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with
such certificate), issue and deliver to such holder (or such other Person
specified pursuant to Subsection 7.1) certificate(s) representing the shares
of Class A Common Stock into which such holder's shares of Class B Common
Stock were converted as a result of such Conversion Event (if such shares are
certificated) or, if such shares are uncertificated, register such shares in
book-entry form. Each share of Class B Common Stock that is converted
pursuant to Subsection 7.1 or 7.2 shall thereupon automatically be retired
and shall not be available for reissuance.

  



  

7.4   _Policies and Procedures_. The Corporation may, from time
to time, establish such administrative policies and procedures, not in
violation of applicable law or the other provisions of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation, relating
to the conversion of the Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, as it
may deem necessary or advisable in connection therewith (it being understood,
for the avoidance of doubt, that this sentence shall not authorize or empower
the Corporation to expand upon the events that constitute a Mandatory Class B
Conversion Event).

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

8.   _Reservation of Stock_. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Class B Common Stock, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.

  



  

9.   _Protective Provisions_. Unless such action is first approved by the affirmative vote (or written consent) of the holders of two-thirds (2/3rd) of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting as a separate class, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, prior to the Final Conversion Date, the Corporation shall not, whether by merger, consolidation, certificate of designation or otherwise (i) amend, alter, repeal or waive any provision of Part A of this _Article IV_ (or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith), or (ii) except for the shares of Class B Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger and as provided in Section 10 below, authorize, or issue any shares of, any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation entitling the holder thereof to more than (1) vote for each share thereof or entitling any class or series of securities to designate or elect directors as a class or series separate from the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

  



  

10.   _Issuance of Additional Shares_. From and after the Effective Date, additional shares of Class B Common Stock may be issued only to a Qualified Stockholder.

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
continuing to own voting securities of the Corporation, the surviving entity
or its parent immediately following the recapitalization, liquidation,

Class B Common Stock by a holder thereof to any other Person shall qualify as
a "Permitted Transfer" within the meaning of this Section, if such Transfer
could have been completed indirectly through one or more transactions
involving more than one Transfer, so long as each Transfer in such transaction
or transactions would otherwise have qualified as a "Permitted Transfer"
within the meaning of this Section. For the further avoidance of doubt, a
Transfer may qualify as a "Permitted Transfer" within the meaning of this
Section under any one or more than one of the clauses of this Section as may
be applicable to such Transfer, without regard to any proviso in, or
requirement of, any other clause(s) of this Section.

  



  

" _Permitted Transferee_ " means, as of any date of determination, a Person

otherwise), including, without limitation, the transfer of a share of Class B
Common Stock to a broker or other nominee or the transfer of, or entering into
a binding agreement with respect to, Voting Control over such share by proxy

respect to a share of Class B Common Stock beneficially held by a Person that
received shares in a Permitted Transfer if there occurs any act or
circumstance that causes such Person to no longer be a Permitted Transferee.
In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, a Transfer shall be deemed to have
occurred if a holder that is a partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability company or corporation distributes or otherwise transfers its
shares of Class B Common Stock to its partners, stockholders, members or
other equity owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not

designated manner; for the avoidance of doubt, any voting trust, agreement or
arrangement entered into prior to the Effective Date shall not constitute a
Transfer;

  



  

(c)  the pledge of shares of Class B Common Stock by a
stockholder that creates a mere security interest in such shares pursuant to
a bona fide loan or indebtedness transaction for so long as such stockholder

such distribution qualifies as a Permitted Transfer at such time);

  



  

(f)  any Transfer of shares of Class B Common Stock, whether by
a Qualified Stockholder or a Permitted Entity, to a broker or other nominee
for so long as the transferor retains (i) Voting Control, (ii) sole
dispositive power over such shares of Class B Common Stock, and (iii) the
economic consequences of ownership of such shares of Class B Common Stock;

  



  

(g)  entering into a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with a broker or other

Stock pursuant to such plan shall constitute a "Transfer" at the time of such
sale;

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(h)  in connection with a Change of Control Transaction (1) the
entering into a support, voting, tender or similar agreement or arrangement,

of Class B Common Stock possesses or obtains an interest in such holder's
shares of Class B Common Stock arising solely by reason of the application of
the community property laws of any jurisdiction, so long as no other event or
circumstance shall exist or have occurred that constitutes a "Transfer" of
such shares of Class B Common Stock; _provided_ that any transfer of shares by
any holder of shares of Class B Common Stock to such holder's spouse,
including a transfer in connection with a divorce proceeding, domestic
relations order or similar legal requirement, shall constitute a "Transfer"

definition of Transfer, or (2) in connection with such divorce proceeding,
domestic relations order or similar legal requirement, a Qualified
Stockholder is entitled to retain (and for so long as a Qualified Stockholder

dispositive power over such shares of Class B Common Stock; and

  



  

(j)  entering into a support, voting, tender or similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding (with or without granting a proxy) in
connection with a Liquidation Event or consummating the actions or
transactions contemplated therein (including, without limitation, tendering
shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with a Liquidation Event, the
consummation of a Liquidation Event or the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, hypothecation or other transfer or disposition of shares of Class
B Common Stock or any legal or beneficial interest in shares of Class B
Common Stock in connection with a Liquidation Event), _provided_ that

granted to the Board from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock in one or
more series, and in connection with the creation of any such series, by
adopting a resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of the shares

accordance with the DGCL (a  " _Preferred Stock Designation_ "), to determine
and fix the number of shares of such series and such voting powers, full or
limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences and relative
participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications,

amendment, or through merger, recapitalization, consolidation or otherwise
amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any provision of this Amended and

(x) the specific approval requirement by the stockholders (or any class of
capital stock of the Corporation) contemplated in such provision, and (y) the

any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware or this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The stockholders may not

its directors and stockholders.

  



  

(A)   _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, except as otherwise
provided by law.

  



  

(B)   _Number of Directors_. Subject to the rights of holders of any
series of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the number of the directors of
the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by the Board; _provided,
further_ , that unless otherwise approved by the Requisite Stockholder

(C)   _Tenure_. The directors shall be elected or appointed for a
term of office continuing until the next annual meeting of stockholders of
the Corporation. Each director shall hold office until such director's

transmission permitted in the Corporation's Bylaws or in accordance with
applicable law.

  



  

(D)   _Vacancies; Newly Created Directorships_. Subject to the rights
of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any newly created directorship
that results from an increase in the number of directors or any vacancy on the
Board that results from the death, disability, resignation, disqualification
or removal of any director or from any other cause shall be filled: (i)
prior to the Voting Threshold Date, solely by the stockholders of the
Corporation with the Requisite Stockholder Consent; or (ii) on or after the
Voting Threshold Date solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the

of Preferred Stock expressly set forth in a Preferred Stock Designation

notice of stockholder nominations for election of directors and other
business to be brought by stockholders before a meeting of stockholders shall
be given in the manner provided by the Bylaws.

(H)   _Preferred Stock Directors_. During any period when the holders
of any series of Preferred Stock have the right to elect additional directors
as provided for or fixed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of
_Article IV_ hereof or any Preferred Stock Designation, then upon
commencement and for the duration of the period during which such right
continues: (i) the then otherwise total number of authorized directors of the
Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of
directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect
the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to said
provisions, and (ii) each such additional director shall serve until such
director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until
such director's right to hold such office terminates pursuant to
said provisions, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his earlier death,
disqualification, resignation or removal. Except as otherwise provided for or
fixed pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of _Article IV_ hereof
or any Preferred Stock Designation, whenever the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested
of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, all such additional
directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected or appointed to
fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or
removal of such additional directors shall automatically cease to be
qualified as directors, the terms of office of all such directors shall
forthwith terminate and the total authorized number of directors of the
Corporation shall be reduced accordingly.

  



  

ARTICLE IX

Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot. The
vote required for election of a director by the stockholders at a meeting of
stockholders shall, except in a contested election, be the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast in favor or against the election of a nominee
at a meeting of stockholders. In a contested election, (i) the directors
shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders
by the holders of stock entitled to vote in such election, and (ii)
stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. An election
shall be considered contested if, as of the tenth (10th) day preceding the
date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to
the stockholders of the Corporation, there are more nominees for election than
directorships on the Board to be filled by election at the meeting.

ARTICLE X 
  
 LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY

  



  

To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or as may
hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be
personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director; _provided, however_ , that
nothing contained in this _Article X_ shall eliminate or limit the liability
of a director (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith
or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)
pursuant to the provisions of Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No
repeal or modification of this _Article X_ shall apply to or have any adverse

director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal
or modification.

  



  

ARTICLE XI

permitted by law, any person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be

Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

  



  

ARTICLE XII 
  
 CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS IN LIEU OF MEETING

  



  

Subject to the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, any action required or
permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be
effected at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be
effected by written consent in lieu of a meeting; _provided_ , that prior to
the Voting Threshold Date, any action required or permitted to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by
the holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted
and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or

Person or Persons; _provided_ that, prior to the Final Conversion Date,
special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may also be
called by or at the request of stockholders of the Corporation collectively
holding shares of capital stock of the Corporation with voting power
sufficient to provide the Requisite Stockholder Consent. Business transacted

Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction,
the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts
of the State of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the Corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any other wrongdoing by, any current or
former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation,
(3) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation arising pursuant to

determine the validity of any provisions of this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or (5) any other action asserting
a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and (ii) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the foregoing provisions of
this _Article XIV_ , the federal district courts of the United States shall
be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any action, suit or
proceeding asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which is within the
scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than the applicable
courts specified in the immediately preceding sentence (a " _Foreign Action_
") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have consented to (a) the
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the
State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to
enforce the preceding sentence and (b) having service of process made upon
such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholder's counsel
in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder. This provision will not
apply to claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal
jurisdiction. Any Person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or
holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this _Article
XIV_.

Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as
applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity,
legality and enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and
of the remaining provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself

ARTICLE I. 
 STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

1.1. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of stockholders shall be held
at such place, if any, as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors (the " _Board_ ") of Butterfly Network, Inc. (the " _Corporation_
"), the Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or, if not so
designated, at the principal office of the Corporation.

  



  

1.2. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders for the
election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the
transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the
meeting shall be held on a date and at a time designated by the Board, the
Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer. The Corporation may
postpone, recess, reschedule or cancel any previously scheduled annual
meeting of stockholders.

  



  

1.3. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by only the Board, the
Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, and may not be
called by any other person or persons; _provided_ that, prior to the Final
Conversion Date (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), special
meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may also be called by or
at the request of stockholders of the Corporation collectively holding shares
of capital stock of the Corporation with voting power sufficient to provide
the Requisite Stockholder Consent (as defined in the Certificate of
Incorporation). Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders
shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the
notice of meeting. The Corporation may postpone, reschedule or cancel any
previously scheduled meeting of stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to any special meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation previously scheduled at the request of the Requisite Stockholder
Consent, the Corporation shall not postpose, reschedule or cancel any such
special meeting without the prior written consent of the stockholders who
comprised the Requisite Stockholder Consent.

  



  

1.4. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, notice of each meeting of
stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than ten (10)
nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Without
limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to
stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation shall be
effective if given by electronic transmission in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). The notices of all
meetings shall state the place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting,
and the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting (if such date is different from the record date for stockholders
entitled to notice of the meeting). The notice of a special meeting shall
state, in addition, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at
such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If
notice is given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed given
at the time specified in Section 232 of the DGCL.

  



  

1.5. _Voting List_. The Corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10)
days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10)
days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder; _provided_ , that
such list shall not be required to contain the electronic mail address or
other electronic contact information of any stockholder. Such list shall be
open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (a) on
a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then such list shall also be open to the examination of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be
provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law,
the stock ledger contemplated by this _Section 1.5_ shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of
stockholders required by this _Section 1.5_ or entitled to vote in person or
by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

  



  

   

1

 



    



  

1.6. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders the
holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of the capital stock of
the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that where a separate vote
by a class or classes or series of capital stock is required by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of
the shares of such class or classes or series of the capital stock of the
Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on such matter,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled
to take action with respect to the vote on such matter. A quorum, once
established at a meeting, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough
votes to leave less than a quorum.

  



  

1.7. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned
from time to time to any other time and to the same or some other place at
which a meeting of stockholders may be held under these Bylaws by the Board,
the chairperson of the meeting or, if directed to be voted on by the
chairperson of the meeting, by a majority of the votes cast by stockholders
present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, although
less than a quorum. It shall not be necessary to notify any stockholder of any
adjournment of thirty (30) days or less if the time and place of the
adjourned meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which adjournment
is taken, unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting (in
which case the Board shall fix the same or an earlier date as the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting and
shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as
of such date). At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

  



  

1.8. _Voting and Proxies_. Each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person or may authorize another
person or persons to vote for such stockholder by proxy. Except as otherwise
limited therein, proxies shall entitle the persons authorized thereby to vote
at any adjournment of such meeting. Proxies shall be filed with the Secretary
of the Corporation. No such proxy shall be voted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period. A proxy
may be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as
long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled
is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation
generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by
attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in
writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later
date with the Secretary of the Corporation.

  



  

1.9. _Action at Meeting_. When a quorum is present at any meeting,
any matter other than the election of directors to be voted upon by
the stockholders at such meeting shall be decided by a majority of the votes
cast by the holders of all of the shares of stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and voting affirmatively or negatively on
such matter (or if one or more class, classes or series of stock are entitled
to vote as a separate class or series, then a majority of the votes cast by
the holders of the shares of stock of such class, classes or series entitled
to vote as a separate class or series present or represented by proxy at the
meeting and voting affirmatively or negatively on such matter), except when a
different or minimum vote is required by law, regulation applicable to the
Corporation or its securities, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange
applicable to the Corporation, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, in which case such different or minimum vote shall be the required
vote on such matter. When a quorum is present at any meeting, in any election
by stockholders of directors other than in a contested election, directors
shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in
favor or against the election of a nominee at a meeting of stockholders. In a
contested election, (i) the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast at a meeting of stockholders by the holders of stock entitled to
vote in such election, and (ii) stockholders shall not be permitted to vote
against a nominee. An election shall be considered contested if, as of the
tenth (10th) day preceding the date on which the Corporation first mails its
notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders of the Corporation,
there are more nominees for election than directorships on the Board to be
filled by election at the meeting.

1.10.   _Nomination of Directors_.

  



  

(A) Except for any directors entitled to be elected by the holders of
preferred stock, at any meeting of stockholders, only persons who are
nominated in accordance with the procedures in this _Section 1.10_ shall be
eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to
the Board at an annual meeting of stockholders or a special meeting of
stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting may be made (i) by or at the direction of
the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof or (ii) by any stockholder
of the Corporation who (x) timely complies with the notice procedures in
_Section 1.10(B)_ , (y) is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving
of such notice and on the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at such meeting and (z) is entitled to vote at such meeting
and on such election.

  



  

(B) To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received in writing
by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation as
follows: (i) in the case of an election of directors at an annual meeting of
stockholders, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's
annual meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the date of
the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days, or delayed by
more than seventy (70), from the first anniversary of the preceding year's
annual meeting, a stockholder's notice must be so received not earlier than
the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and
(B) the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of
such annual meeting is first made; or (ii) in the case of an election of
directors at a special meeting of stockholders,  _provided_ that directors
are to be elected at such special meeting as set forth in the Corporation's
notice of meeting and _provided further_ that the nomination made by the
stockholder is for one of the director positions that the notice of meeting
states will be filled at such special meeting, not earlier than the 120th day
prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of (x) the 90th day prior to such special meeting and (y) the tenth day
following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such special
meeting for the election of directors is first made. The number of nominees a
stockholder may nominate for election at a meeting (or in the case of a
stockholder giving the notice on behalf of a beneficial owner, the number of
nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at the meeting on behalf of
such beneficial owner) shall not exceed the number of directors to be elected
at such meeting. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of a
meeting (or the public disclosure thereof) commence a new time period (or
extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice.

  



  

The stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (A) as to each
proposed nominee (1) such person's name, age, business address and, if known,
residence address, (2) such person's principal occupation or employment, (3)
the class(es) and series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation
that are, directly or indirectly, owned, beneficially or of record, by such
person, (4) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other
material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past
three years, and any other material relationships, between or among (x) the
stockholder, the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is
being made and the respective affiliates and associates of, or others acting
in concert with, such stockholder and such beneficial owner, on the one hand,
and (y) each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and
associates, or others acting in concert with such nominee(s), on the other
hand, including all information that would be required to be disclosed
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K if the stockholder making the
nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made or
any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith were
the "registrant" for purposes of such Item and the proposed nominee were a
director or executive officer of such registrant, and (5) any other
information concerning such person that must be disclosed as to nominees in
proxy solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "); and (B) as to the
stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination is being made (1) the name and address of such
stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such
beneficial owner, (2) the class(es) and series and number of shares of stock
of the corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned, beneficially or
of record, by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (3) a description
of any agreement, arrangement or understanding between or among such
stockholder and/or such beneficial owner and each proposed nominee and any
other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the
nomination(s) are being made or who may participate in the solicitation of
proxies in favor of electing such nominee(s), (4) a description of any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short
positions, swaps, profit interests, options, warrants,
convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging
transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into by,
or on behalf of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner, the effect or
intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price
changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or
such beneficial owner with respect to shares of stock of the Corporation, (5)
any other information relating to such stockholder and such beneficial
owner that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other
filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for
the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (6) a
representation that such stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and on such election and intends
to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the
person(s) named in its notice and (7) a representation whether such
stockholder and/or such beneficial owner intends or is part of a group which
intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at
least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock
reasonably believed by such stockholder or such beneficial owner to be
sufficient to elect the nominee (and such representation shall be included in
any such proxy statement and form of proxy) and/or (y) otherwise to solicit
proxies or votes from stockholders in support of such nomination (and such
representation shall be included in any such solicitation materials). Not
later than ten (10) days after the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, the information required by
Items (A)(1)-(5) and (B)(1)-(5) of the prior sentence shall be supplemented by
the stockholder giving the notice to provide updated information as of such
record date. In addition, to be effective, the stockholder's notice must be
accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to serve as a
director if elected and to being named in the Corporation's proxy statement
and associated proxy card as a nominee of the stockholder. The Corporation may
require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as the
Corporation may reasonably require to, among other things, determine the
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the
Corporation or whether such nominee would be independent under applicable
Securities and Exchange Commission and stock exchange rules and the
Corporation's publicly disclosed corporate governance guidelines, as
applicable. A stockholder shall not have complied with this _Section 1.10(B)_
if the stockholder (or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
nomination is made) solicits or does not solicit, as the case may be, proxies
or votes in support of such stockholder's nominee in contravention of the
representations with respect thereto required by this _Section 1.10_.

(C) The chairperson of any meeting shall have the power and duty to
determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 1.10_ (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group
which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in
support of such stockholder's nominee in compliance with the representations
with respect thereto required by this _Section 1.10_ ), and if the
chairperson should determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 1.10_ , the chairperson shall so declare to
the meeting and such nomination shall not be brought before the meeting.
Without limiting the foregoing, in advance of any meeting of stockholders,
the Board shall also have the power to determine whether any nomination
was made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.10_ (including
whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
nomination is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did
not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's
nominee in compliance with the representations with respect thereto
required by this _Section 1.10_ ).

  



  

(D) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this _Section
1.10_ shall obligate the Corporation or the Board to include in any proxy
statement or other stockholder communication distributed on behalf of the
Corporation or the Board information with respect to any nominee for director
submitted by a stockholder.

  



  

(E) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.10_
, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the meeting to present
a nomination, such nomination shall not be brought before the
meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nominee may have
been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this _Article I_ , to be
considered a " _qualified representative_ " of the stockholder, a person must
be authorized by a written instrument executed by such stockholder or an
electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such
stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must
produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable
reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the
meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(F) For purposes of this _Article I_ , " _public disclosure_ " shall
include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(G) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 1.10_ to the
contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board
at any annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which
nominations would otherwise be due under _Section 1.10(B)_ and there is no
public disclosure by the Corporation naming the nominees for the additional
directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary
of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by
_Section 1.10(B)_ with respect to nominations for such annual meeting shall
also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth day following the day on which such public
disclosure is first made by the Corporation.

1.11.   _Notice of Business to be Brought Before a Meeting_.

  



  

(A) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business
shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To
be properly brought before an annual meeting, business (other than the
nominations of persons for election to the Board) must constitute a proper
matter for stockholder action and must be (i) specified in a notice of meeting
given by or at the direction of the Board or any duly authorized committee
thereof, (ii) if not specified in a notice of meeting, otherwise brought
before the meeting by the Board or any duly authorized committee thereof or
the Chairperson of the Board or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the
meeting by a stockholder who (A) (1) was a stockholder of record of the
Corporation both at the time of giving the notice provided for in this
_Section 1.11_ and at the time of the meeting, (2) is entitled to vote at the
meeting, and (3) has complied with this _Section 1.11_ in all applicable
respects or (B) properly made such proposal in compliance with Rule 14a-8
under the Exchange Act. The foregoing clause (iii) shall be the exclusive
means for a stockholder to propose business to be brought before an annual
meeting of the stockholders. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
unless otherwise required by law, if a stockholder seeking to bring business
before an annual meeting pursuant to clause (iii) of this _Section 1.11(A)_
(or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the
meeting to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be
transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such proposed business
may have been received by the Corporation.

  



  

(B) Without qualification, for business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must (i) provide
Timely Notice (as defined below) thereof in writing and in proper form to the
Secretary of the Corporation and (ii) provide any updates or supplements to
such notice at the times and in the forms required by this _Section 1.11_. To
be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to, or mailed and
received at, the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than
ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the one-
year anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30)
days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered, or mailed and
received, not later than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or, if
later, the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure of the date
of such annual meeting was first made (such notice within such time periods, "
_Timely Notice_ "). In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an
annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period
(or extend any time period) for the giving of Timely Notice as described
above.

  



  

(C)  To be in proper form for purposes of this _Section 1.11_ , a
stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth:

  



  

(i)  As to each Proposing Person (as defined below), (A) the
name and address of such Proposing Person (including, if applicable, the name
and address that appear on the Corporation's books and records); and (B) the
class(es) and series and number of shares of the Corporation that are,
directly or indirectly, owned of record and beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by such Proposing Person,
except that such Proposing Person shall in all events be deemed to
beneficially own any shares of any class or series of the Corporation as to
which such Proposing Person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership at
any time in the future (the disclosures to be made pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) are referred to as " _Stockholder Information_ ");

(ii) As to each Proposing Person, (A) the full notional amount of
any securities that, directly or indirectly, underlie any
"derivative security" (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the
Exchange Act) that constitutes a "call equivalent position" (as such term is
defined in Rule 16a-1(b) under the Exchange Act) ("Synthetic Equity Position")
and that is, directly or indirectly, held or maintained by such Proposing
Person with respect to any shares of any class(es) or series of shares of
the Corporation; provided that, for the purposes of the definition of
"Synthetic Equity Position," the term "derivative security" shall also
include any security or instrument that would not otherwise constitute a
"derivative security" as a result of any feature that would make any
conversion, exercise or similar right or privilege of such security or
instrument becoming determinable only at some future date or upon the
happening of a future occurrence, in which case the determination of the
amount of securities into which such security or instrument would be
convertible or exercisable shall be made assuming that such security or
instrument is immediately convertible or exercisable at the time of such
determination; and, provided, further, that any Proposing Person satisfying
the requirements of Rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the Exchange Act (other than a
Proposing Person that so satisfies Rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the Exchange Act
solely by reason of Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(E)) shall not be deemed to hold or
maintain the notional amount of any securities that underlie a Synthetic
Equity Position held by such Proposing Person as a hedge with respect to a
bona fide derivatives trade or position of such Proposing Person arising in
the ordinary course of such Proposing Person's business as a derivatives
dealer, (B) any rights to dividends on the shares of any class or series
of shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such Proposing Person that
are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (C)

Person is a party or material participant involving the Corporation or any of
its officers or directors, or any affiliate of the Corporation, (D) any other

Corporation and any affiliate of the Corporation, on the other hand, (E) any
direct or indirect material interest in any material contract or agreement of

Corporation (including, in any such case, any employment agreement, collective
bargaining agreement or consulting agreement), (F) a representation that such
stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the
meeting to propose such business, (G) a representation that such Proposing
Person intends or is part of a group which intends to deliver a proxy
statement or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the
Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the
proposal or otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such
proposal and (H) any other information relating to such Proposing Person
that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing
required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies or consents
by such Proposing Person in support of the business proposed to be brought
before the meeting pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act (the
disclosures to be made pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) through (G) are
referred to as "Disclosable Interests"); provided, however, that Disclosable
Interests shall not include any such disclosures with respect to the
ordinary course business activities of any broker, dealer, commercial bank,
trust company or other nominee who is a Proposing Person solely as a result
of being the stockholder directed to prepare and submit the notice required by
these Bylaws on behalf of a beneficial owner; and

  



  

(iii) As to each item of business that the stockholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting, (A) a brief description of the business
desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting
such business at the annual meeting and any material interest in such
business of each Proposing Person, (B) the text of the proposal or business
(including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the
event that such business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the
language of the proposed amendment), and (C) a reasonably detailed
description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings (x) between or
among any of the Proposing Persons or (y) between or among any Proposing
Person and any other record or beneficial holder(s) of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation or persons(s) who have a right to acquire beneficial
ownership at any time in the future of the shares of any class or series of
the Corporation (including their names), in connection with the proposal of
such business by such stockholder; and (D) any other information relating to
such item of business that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy
statement or other filing required to be made in connection with solicitations
of proxies in support of the business proposed to be brought before the
meeting pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act; provided, however, that
the disclosures required by this paragraph (iii) shall not include any
disclosures with respect to any broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust
company or other nominee who is a Proposing Person solely as a result of
being the stockholder directed to prepare and submit the notice required by
these Bylaws on behalf of a beneficial owner.

  



  

For purposes of this  _Section 1.11_ , the term "Proposing Person" shall mean
(i) the stockholder providing the notice of business proposed to be brought
before an annual meeting, (ii) the beneficial owner or beneficial owners, if
different, on whose behalf the notice of the business proposed to be brought
before the annual meeting is made, and (iii) any participant (as defined in

(D)  A Proposing Person shall update and supplement its notice to the
Corporation of its intent to propose business at an annual meeting, if
necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such
notice pursuant to this _Section 1.11_  shall be true and correct as of the
record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and as of the
date that is ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be
delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days
after the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (in the
case of the update and supplement required to be made as of such record
date), and not later than eight (8) business days prior to the date for the
meeting or, if practicable, any adjournment or postponement thereof (and, if
not practicable, on the first practicable date prior to the date to which
the meeting has been adjourned or postponed) (in the case of the update and
supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the
meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof). For the avoidance of
doubt, the obligation to update and supplement as set forth in this paragraph
or any other Section of these Bylaws shall not limit the Corporation's rights
with respect to any deficiencies in any notice provided by a stockholder,
extend any applicable deadlines hereunder or enable or be deemed to permit a
stockholder who has previously submitted notice hereunder to amend or update
any proposal or to submit any new proposal, including by changing or adding
matters, business or resolutions proposed to be brought before a meeting of
the stockholders.

  



  

(E)  Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no
business shall be conducted at an annual meeting that is not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with this _Section 1.11_. The chairperson of
the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether any proposed
business was brought in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.11_
, and if the chairperson should determine that the business was not properly
brought before the meeting in accordance with this _Section 1.11_ , the
chairperson shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly
brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Without limiting the
foregoing, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, the Board shall also
have the power to determine whether any proposed business was made in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.11_.

  



  

(F) This  _Section 1.11_ is expressly intended to apply to any
business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of
stockholders other than any proposal made in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act and included in the Corporation's proxy statement. In
addition to the requirements of this _Section 1.11_ with respect to any
business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders,
each Proposing Person shall comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act with respect to any such business. Nothing in this _Section
1.11_ shall be deemed to affect the rights of stockholders to
request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant
to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

1.12. _Conduct of Meetings_.

  



  

(A)  Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the

meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and
(for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the
judgment of such chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the
meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board

limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of
business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at

Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer shall appoint one or
more inspectors of election to act at the meeting and make a written report
thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as alternate inspectors
to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is
present, ready and willing to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
chairperson of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting. Unless otherwise required by law, inspectors may be officers,
employees or agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon
the discharge of such inspector's duties, shall take and sign an oath
faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and
according to the best of such inspector's ability. The inspector shall have
the duties prescribed by law and, when the vote is completed, shall certify
their determination of the result of the vote taken and of such other facts
as may be required by law. Every vote taken by ballots shall be counted by a
duly appointed inspector or duly appointed inspectors.

each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of each certificate representing shares of
such class or series of stock, _provided_ that in lieu of the foregoing
requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of each certificate
representing shares of such class or series of stock a statement that the
Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests
the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional
or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or
rights.

  



  

Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated
shares, the registered owner thereof shall be given a notice, in writing or
by electronic transmission, containing the information required to be set
forth or stated on certificates pursuant to Sections 151, 156, 202(a) or
218(a) of the DGCL or, with respect to Section 151 of the DGCL, a statement
that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so
requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating,
optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or
rights.

  



  

4.2. _Transfers_. Shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable in the manner prescribed by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation and in these Bylaws. Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation or by transfer
agents designated to transfer shares of stock of the Corporation. Subject to
applicable law, shares of stock represented by certificates shall be
transferred only on the books of the Corporation by the surrender to the
Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate representing such shares
properly endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment or power of
attorney properly executed, and with such proof of authority or the
authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its transfer agent may
reasonably require. Except as may be otherwise required by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, the Corporation shall be
entitled to treat the record holder of stock as shown on its books as the
owner of such stock for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and
the right to vote with respect to such stock, regardless of any transfer,
pledge or other disposition of such stock until the shares have been
transferred on the books of the Corporation in accordance with the
requirements of these Bylaws.

  



  

4.3. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Corporation may
issue a new certificate or uncertificated shares in place of any
previously issued certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon such terms and conditions as the Board may prescribe, including the
presentation of reasonable evidence of such loss, theft or destruction and the
giving of such indemnity and posting of such bond sufficient to indemnify the
Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of
such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

  



  

4.4. _Record Date_. The Board may fix in advance a date as a record
date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of any
meeting of stockholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful
action. Such record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted, and such record date shall not be
more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such
meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action to which
such record date relates. If the Board so fixes a record date for determining
the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders, such date
shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination.

  



  

If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at
the close of business on the day before the day on which notice is given, or,
if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day before the day on
which the meeting is held. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating to such
purpose.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Board may fix a new record date for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and
in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed
for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at
the adjourned meeting.

  



  

4.5. _Regulations_. The issue, conversion and registration of shares
of stock of the Corporation shall be governed by such other regulations as
the Board may establish.

ARTICLE VII.

  

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT

  



  

7.1. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other
than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to _Section 7.3_ ,
the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or,
while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such
person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.

  



  

7.2. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in
the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to _Section 7.3_ , the Corporation
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the
right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation,
or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity by the Corporation for such expenses which
the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

  



  

7.3. _Authorization of Indemnification_. Any indemnification under
this _Article VII_ (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
_Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ , as the case may be. Such determination shall
be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of
such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not
parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum,
or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such
directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such
directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be
made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons
having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the
extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall
be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the
necessity of authorization in the specific case.

  



  

7.4. _Good Faith Defined_. For purposes of any determination under
_Section 7.3_ , a person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no
reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful, if such
person's action is based on good faith reliance on the records or books of
account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied
to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in
the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the
Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or
reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent
certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with
reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term  "another
enterprise" as used in this _Section 7.4_ shall mean any other corporation or
any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this
_Section 7.4_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the
circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in  _Sections 7.1_ or _7.2_ , as the case may
be.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

7.5. _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under _Section 7.3_ , and notwithstanding
the absence of any determination thereunder, if (i) following the final
disposition of the applicable proceeding, a claim for indemnification under
_Sections 7.1_ or _7.2_ of this _Article VII_ is not paid in full by the
Corporation within ninety (90) days after the later of a written claim for
indemnification has been received by the Corporation, or (ii) a claim for
advancement of expenses under _Section 7.6_ of this _Article VII_ is not paid
in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after the Corporation has
received a statement or statements requesting such amounts to be advanced,
the claimant may at any time thereafter (but not before) bring suit against
the Corporation in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware to recover
the unpaid amount of the claim, together with interest thereon, or to obtain
advancement of expenses, as applicable. It shall be a defense to any such
action brought to enforce a right to indemnification (but not in an action
brought to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) that the claimant
has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL
(or other applicable law) for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for
the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
Corporation. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under
_Section 7.3 _ nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a
defense to such application or create a presumption that the claimant has not
met any applicable standard of conduct. If successful, in whole or in part,
the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting
such claim, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection
therewith, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

  



  

7.6. _Expenses Payable in Advance_. Expenses, including without
limitation attorneys' fees, incurred by a current or former director or
officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, suit or proceeding to which such person is a party or is threatened
to be made a party or otherwise involved as a witness or otherwise by reason
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance
of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such current or former director or officer
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is
not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this
_Article VII_ or otherwise.

  



  

7.7. _Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of
Expenses_. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by or granted pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, any
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation
that, subject to _Section 7.11_ , indemnification of the persons specified in
_Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ shall be made to the fullest extent permitted
by law. The provisions of this _Article VII_ shall not be deemed to preclude
the indemnification of any person who is not specified in _Sections 7.1_ or
_7.2_ but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under
the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.

  



  

7.8. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such
person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
_Article VII_.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

7.9. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this _Article VII_ ,
references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify
its directors, officers, employees or agents so that any person who is or was
a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or, while a director
or officer of such constituent corporation, is or was serving at the request
of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
this _Article VII_ with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as
such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its
separate existence had continued. For purposes of this _Article VII_ ,
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person
with respect of any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the
request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this _Article VII_.

  



  

7.10. _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses _provided_ by, or
granted pursuant to, this _Article VII_ shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

7.11. _Limitation on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this _Article VII_ to the contrary, except for proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses (which shall be
governed by _Section 7.5_ ), the Corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify any current or former director or officer in connection with an
action, suit proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless
such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

7.12. _Contract Rights_. The obligations of the Corporation under
this _Article VII_ to indemnify, and advance expenses to, a person who is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation shall be considered a contract
between the Corporation and such person, and no modification or repeal of any
provision of this _Article VII_ shall affect, to the detriment of such person,
such obligations of the Corporation in connection with a claim based on any
act or failure to act occurring before such modification or repeal.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the proposed business combination (the " _Transaction_ ")
between Longview Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), and Butterfly Network, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Target_ "),
pursuant to that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November

among, the Company, Target and certain other parties named therein, the
Company is seeking commitments to purchase shares of the Company's Class A
Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Common Stock_"), for a
purchase price of $10.00 per share (the " _Purchase Price_ "), in a private
placement to be conducted by the Company (the " _Offering_ ").

  



  

On the date set forth on the signature page of this subscription agreement
(this " _Subscription Agreement_ "), the Company is entering into
subscription agreements (the " _Other Subscription Agreements_ " and together
with the Subscription Agreement, the " _Subscription Agreements_ ") with
certain other subscribers (the " _Other Subscribers_ " and together with the
undersigned, the " _Subscribers_ "), pursuant to which the Subscribers,
severally and not jointly, have agreed to purchase on the closing date of the
Transaction, inclusive of the shares of Common Stock to be purchased by
the undersigned, an aggregate amount of up to 17,500,000 shares of Common
Stock, at the Purchase Price. In connection therewith, the undersigned
subscriber (" _Subscriber_ ") and the Company agree as follows:

  



  

1.   _Subscription_. Subscriber hereby subscribes for and agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company hereby agrees to issue and sell to the Subscriber, such number of shares of Common Stock as is set forth on the signature page of this Subscription Agreement (the " _Shares_ ") at the Purchase Price per Share and on the terms provided for herein.

  



  

2.   _Closing; Delivery of Shares_.

  



  

(a)  The closing of the sale of Shares contemplated hereby (the
" _Closing_ ", and the date that the Closing actually occurs, the " _Closing
Date_ ") is contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the
Transaction (the " _Transaction Closing_ "). The Closing shall occur on the
date of, and immediately prior to, the Transaction Closing.

  



  

   



 



    



  

(b)  The Company shall provide written notice (which may be via
email) to the Subscriber (the " _Closing Notice_ ") that the Company
reasonably expects all conditions of the Transaction Closing to be satisfied
or waived on a date specified in the notice (the " _Scheduled Closing Date_
") that is not less than five (5) business days from the date on which the
Closing Notice is delivered to the Subscriber, which Closing Notice shall
contain the Company's wire instructions for an escrow account (the " _Escrow

Section 3, Subscriber shall deliver to the Company, on or prior to the
Scheduled Closing Date, the Purchase Price for the Shares by wire transfer of

writing at a reasonable time in advance of the Closing, certificated) form,
free and clear of any liens or other restrictions whatsoever (other than those
arising under state or federal securities laws), in the name of Subscriber
(or its nominee in accordance with its delivery instructions) or to a
custodian designated by Subscriber, as applicable, and (2) a copy of the
records of the transfer agent of the Company showing Subscriber as the owner
of the Shares on and as of the Closing Date (the " _Subscriber 's
Deliveries_"). Unless otherwise provided pursuant to Alternative Settlement
Procedures, upon transfer of the Subscriber's Deliveries by the Company to
Subscriber (or its nominee in accordance with its delivery instructions), the
Escrow Agent shall release the Purchase Price from the Escrow Account to
the Company. If this Subscription Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing and any funds have already been sent by the Subscriber to the Escrow
Account, then promptly after such termination, the Company will instruct the
Escrow Agent to promptly return such funds to the Subscriber. If the
Transaction Closing does not occur within two (2) business days of the
Scheduled Closing Date, unless otherwise instructed by the Company and the
Subscriber, the Escrow Agent or the Company, as applicable, shall promptly
(but not later than one (1) business day thereafter) return the Purchase
Price to Subscriber by wire transfer of U.S. dollars in immediately available
funds to the account specified by Subscriber, and any book entries or share
certificates shall be deemed cancelled and any share certificates shall be
promptly (but not later than one (1) business day thereafter) returned to the
Company.

waiver by each party of the conditions that, on the Closing Date:

threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes, shall have occurred;

  



  

(ii)  no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction shall
have rendered, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any judgment, order,
law, rule or regulation (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is

the transactions contemplated hereby; and

warranties that are qualified as to materiality, which representations and
warranties shall be true in all respects) as of such date); and

  



  

(ii)  the Subscriber shall have performed, satisfied and

Subscription Agreement, including the issuance and sale of the Shares and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not conflict with
or result in a material breach or material violation of any of the terms or
provisions of, or constitute a material default under, or result in the
creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the
property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the

lease or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its

which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, operations, condition (including

the Shares or the legal authority or ability of the Company to perform in all

its obligations under the terms of this Subscription Agreement.

there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for,
purchase or acquire from the Company shares of Common Stock, Class B Common

(h)  Other than the Other Subscription Agreements, the
Transaction Agreement and any other agreement contemplated by the
Transaction Agreement, the Company has not entered into any side letter or
similar agreement with any Other Subscriber or any other investor in
connection with such Other Subscriber's or investor's direct or indirect
investment in the Company. No Other Subscription Agreement includes terms and
conditions that are materially more advantageous to any such Other Subscriber
than the Subscriber hereunder, and such Other Subscription Agreements have
not been amended or modified in any material respect following the date of
this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

(i)  The Company has made available to Subscriber (including
via the SEC's EDGAR system) a true, correct and complete copy of each form,
report, statement, schedule, prospectus, proxy, registration statement and
other documents filed by the Company with the SEC prior to the date of this
Subscription Agreement (the " _SEC Documents_ "). None of the SEC Documents
filed under the Exchange Act contained, when filed and as amended to the date
hereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and such SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. The Company has timely
filed each report, statement, schedule, prospectus, and registration
statement that the Company was required to file with the SEC since its
initial registration of the Common Stock with the SEC. As of the date hereof,
there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
from the Staff of the SEC with respect to any of the SEC Documents.

  



  

(j)  Except for such matters as have not had and would not be
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, there is no (i) action, suit, claim or other proceeding, in
each case by or before any governmental authority pending, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or (ii) judgment,
decree, injunction, ruling or order of any governmental entity outstanding
against the Company.

  



  

(k)  The Company is in compliance with all applicable laws,
except where such non-compliance would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has not received any written
communication from a governmental entity that alleges that the Company is not
in compliance with or is in default or violation of any applicable law, except
where such non-compliance, default or violation would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(l)  The Company has not entered into any agreement or
arrangement entitling any agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other person to any broker's or finder's fee or any other commission or
similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Subscription Agreement for which the Subscriber could become liable. Other
than UBS Securities LLC (the " _Placement Agent_ "), the Company is not aware
of any person that has been or will be paid (directly or indirectly)
remuneration for solicitation of purchasers in connection with the sale of any
shares of Common Stock in the Offering.

  



  

(m)  The Company is not, and immediately after receipt of payment
for the Shares, will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

  



  

(n)  Assuming the accuracy of the Subscriber's representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 5_ , in connection with the offer, sale
and delivery of the Shares in the manner contemplated by this Subscription
Agreement, it is not necessary to register the Shares under the Securities
Act. The Shares (i) were not offered by any form of general solicitation or
general advertising and (ii) are not being offered in a manner involving a
public offering under, or in a distribution in violation of, the Securities
Act or any state securities laws.

  



  

(o)  The Company understands that the foregoing representations

Subscriber.

(a)  At the time the Subscriber was offered the Shares, it was,
and as of the date hereof, the Subscriber is (i) an "accredited investor"
(within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act)
as indicated in the questionnaire attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto, and (ii) is
acquiring the Shares only for its own account and (iii) not for the account
of others, and not on behalf of any other account or person or with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act. The Subscriber is not an entity formed for
the specific purpose of acquiring the Shares.

  



  

(b)  The Subscriber understands that the Shares are being
offered in a transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning
of the Securities Act and that the Shares delivered at the Closing have not

Shares may not be resold, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of by the
Subscriber absent an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act except (i) to the Company or a subsidiary thereof, (ii) to
non-U.S. persons pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United
States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act or (iii)
pursuant to another applicable exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act, and in each of cases (i) and (iii) in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of the states and other jurisdictions of the United
States, and that any certificates (if any) or any book-entry shares
representing the Shares delivered at the Closing shall contain a legend or
restrictive notation to such effect, as a result, the Subscriber may not be
able to readily offer, resell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the
Shares and may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the
Shares for an indefinite period of time. The Subscriber acknowledges that the
Shares will not be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated
under the Securities Act. The Subscriber further acknowledges that the Shares
will not be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, until, among other requirements, at least one year has elapsed
from the time that the Company has filed current Form 10 information with the
SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. The
Subscriber understands that it has been advised to consult legal counsel
prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the Shares.

  



  

(c)  The Subscriber understands and agrees that the Subscriber
is purchasing Shares directly from the Company. The Subscriber further
acknowledges that there have been no representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements made to the Subscriber by the Company, or any of its officers
or directors, expressly (other than those representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements included in this Subscription Agreement) or by
implication.

  



  

(d)  The Subscriber's acquisition and holding of the Shares
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
any applicable similar law.

  



  

(e)  The Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that the Subscriber
has received such information as the Subscriber deems necessary in order to
make an investment decision with respect to the Shares. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Subscriber acknowledges that it has received
(or in the case of documents filed with the SEC, had access to) the following
items (collectively, the " _Disclosure Documents_ "): (i) the SEC Documents,
including the final prospectus of the Company, dated as of May 20, 2020 and
filed with the SEC on May 20, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ "), (ii) the
Transaction Agreement, a copy of which will be filed by the Company with the
SEC and (iii) the investor presentation by the Company and the Target, a
copy of which will be furnished by the Company to the SEC. The undersigned
understands the significant extent to which certain of the disclosures
contained in item (i) above shall not apply following the Transaction Closing.
The Subscriber represents and agrees that the Subscriber and the Subscriber's
professional advisor(s), if any, have had the full opportunity to ask the
Company's management questions, receive such answers and obtain such
information as the Subscriber and such Subscriber's professional advisor(s),
if any, have deemed necessary to make an investment decision with respect to
the Shares.

  



  

(f)  The Subscriber became aware of this Offering of the
Shares solely by means of direct contact between the Subscriber and the
Company, the Placement Agent or a representative of the Company or the
Placement Agent, and the Shares were offered to the Subscriber solely by
direct contact between the Subscriber and the Company, the Placement Agent or
a representative of the Company or the Placement Agent. The Subscriber
acknowledges that the Company represents and warrants that the Shares (i) were
not offered by any form of general solicitation or general advertising and
(ii) are not being offered in a manner involving a public offering under, or
in a distribution in violation of, the Securities Act, or any state securities
laws.

(g)  The Subscriber acknowledges that it is aware that there
are substantial risks incident to the purchase and ownership of the Shares,
including those set forth in the Disclosure Documents and in the Company's
filings with the SEC. The Subscriber is able to fend for itself in the
transactions contemplated herein and has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of an investment in the Shares, and the Subscriber has sought
such accounting, legal and tax advice as the Subscriber has considered
necessary to make an informed investment decision.

  



  

(h)  Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), the
Subscriber has adequately analyzed and fully considered the risks of an
investment in the Shares and determined that the Shares are a suitable
investment for the Subscriber and that the Subscriber is able at this time
and in the foreseeable future to bear the economic risk of a total loss of the
Subscriber's investment in the Company. The Subscriber acknowledges
specifically that a possibility of total loss exists.

  



  

(i)  In making its decision to purchase the Shares, the
Subscriber has relied solely upon independent investigation made by
the Subscriber and the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Subscriber has not relied on any statements or other information provided by
the Placement Agent concerning the Company, Target or the Shares or the offer
and sale of the Shares.

  



  

(j)  The Subscriber understands and agrees that no federal or
state agency has passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offering or made
any findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment or the
accuracy or adequacy of the Company's filings with the SEC.

  



  

(k)  The Subscriber has been duly formed or incorporated and is
validly existing in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation.

  



  

(l)  The execution, delivery and performance by the Subscriber
of this Subscription Agreement are within the powers of the Subscriber, have
been duly authorized and will not constitute or result in a breach or default
under or conflict with any federal or state statute, rule or regulation
applicable to the Subscriber, any order, ruling or regulation of any court or
other tribunal or of any governmental commission or agency, or any agreement
or other undertaking, to which the Subscriber is a party or by which
the Subscriber is bound, and, if the Subscriber is not an individual, will
not violate any provisions of the Subscriber's charter documents, including
its incorporation or formation papers, bylaws, indenture of trust or
partnership or operating agreement, as may be applicable. The signature on
this Subscription Agreement is genuine, and the signatory, if the Subscriber
is an individual, has legal competence and capacity to execute the same or,
if the Subscriber is not an individual the signatory has been duly
authorized to execute the same, and this Subscription Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Subscriber, enforceable against
the Subscriber in accordance with its terms.

(m)  Neither the due diligence investigation conducted by the
Subscriber in connection with making its decision to acquire the Shares nor
any representations and warranties made by the Subscriber herein shall modify,
amend or affect the Subscriber's right to rely on the truth, accuracy and
completeness of the Company's representations and warranties contained herein.

  



  

(n)  The Subscriber is not (i) a person or entity named on the
List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons administered by
the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (" _OFAC_ ")
or in any Executive Order issued by the President of the United States and
administered by OFAC (" _OFAC List_ "), or a person or entity prohibited by
any OFAC sanctions program, (ii) a Designated National as defined in the Cuban
Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515, or (iii) a non-U.S. shell
bank or providing banking services indirectly to a non-U.S. shell bank
(collectively, a " _Prohibited Investor_ "). The Subscriber agrees to provide
law enforcement agencies, if requested thereby, such records as required by
applicable law, provided that the Subscriber is permitted to do so under
applicable law. If the Subscriber is a financial institution subject to the
Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.), as amended by the USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001, and its implementing regulations (collectively, the "
_BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), the Subscriber maintains policies and procedures
reasonably designed to comply with applicable obligations under the
BSA/PATRIOT Act. To the extent required, it maintains policies and
procedures reasonably designed for the screening of its investors against the
OFAC sanctions programs, including the OFAC List. To the extent required, it
maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the funds
held by the Subscriber and used to purchase the Shares were legally derived.

  



  

(o)  No disclosure or offering document has been prepared by
the Placement Agent in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares. The
Placement Agent and each of its members, directors, officers, employees,
representatives and controlling persons have made no independent
investigation with respect to the Company or the Shares or the accuracy,
completeness or adequacy of any information supplied to the Subscriber by the
Company. In connection with the issue and purchase of the Shares, the
Placement Agent has not acted as the Subscriber's financial advisor or
fiduciary.

6.   _Registration Rights_.

  



  

(a)  The Company agrees that, within forty-five (45) calendar
days after the Transaction Closing (the " _Filing Date_ "), the Company will
file with the SEC (at the Company's sole cost and expense) a registration
statement registering the resale of the Shares (the initial registration
statement and any other registration statement that may be filed by the
Company under this Section 6, the " _Registration Statement_ "), and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the
filing thereof but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day (or
120th calendar day if the SEC notifies the Company that it will "review" the
Registration Statement) following the Transaction Closing and (ii) the 10th
business day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing,
whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the Registration Statement will not be
"reviewed" or will not be subject to further review (such earlier date, the "
_Effectiveness Date_ "). The Company agrees that the Company will cause such
Registration Statement or another registration statement (which may be a
"shelf" registration statement) to remain effective until the earlier of (i)
three (3) years from the date of effectiveness of the initial Registration
Statement, (ii) the date on which the Subscriber ceases to hold the Shares
covered by such Registration Statement, or (iii) on the first date on
which the Subscriber can sell all of its Shares under Rule 144 of the
Securities Act without restriction, including without limitation, any volume
and manner of sale restrictions which may be applicable to affiliates under
Rule 144 and without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with
the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(1) (or Rule
144(i)(2), if applicable). The Subscriber agrees to disclose its beneficial
ownership, as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act,
of the Shares to the Company upon request to assist the Company in making the
determination described above. The Company's obligations to include the
Shares in the Registration Statement are contingent upon the Subscriber
furnishing in writing to the Company such information regarding the
Subscriber, the securities of the Company held by the Subscriber and the
intended method of disposition of the Shares as shall be reasonably requested
by the Company to effect the registration of the Shares, and shall execute
such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may
reasonably request that are customary of a selling stockholder in similar
situations, provided that Subscriber shall not in connection with the
foregoing be required to execute any lock-up or similar agreement or
otherwise be subject to any contractual restriction on the ability to transfer
the Shares. With respect to the information to be provided by Subscriber
pursuant to this Section 6 or otherwise in connection with the Registration
Statement, the Company shall request such information from Subscriber at
least ten (10) business days prior to the anticipated filing date of the
Registration Statement. Any failure by the Company to file the Registration
Statement by the Filing Date or for the Registration Statement to be declared
effective by the Effectiveness Date shall not otherwise relieve the Company of
its obligations to file or effect the Registration Statement as set forth in
this Section 6. For purposes of this Section 6, "Shares" shall mean, as of
any date of determination, the Shares and any other equity security of the
Company issued or issuable with respect to the Shares by way of share split,
dividend, distribution, recapitalization, merger, exchange, replacement or
similar event or otherwise.

  



  

(b)  In the case of the registration, qualification, exemption
or compliance effected by the Company pursuant to this
Subscription Agreement, the Company shall, upon reasonable request, inform
Subscriber as to the status of such registration, qualification, exemption
and compliance. At its expense, the Company shall:

  



  

(i)  except for such times as the Company is permitted
hereunder to suspend the use of the prospectus forming part of a
Registration Statement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such
registration, and any qualification, exemption or compliance under state
securities laws which the Company determines to obtain, continuously effective
with respect to Subscriber, and to keep the applicable Registration Statement
or any subsequent shelf registration statement free of any material
misstatements or omissions;

  



  

(ii)  advise Subscriber within five (5) business days:

  



  

(A)  of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for such purpose;

  



  

(B)  of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Shares included therein
for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose; and

  



  

(C)  subject to the provisions in this Subscription Agreement, of
the occurrence of any event that requires the making of any changes in any
Registration Statement or prospectus included therein so that, as of such
date, the statements therein are not misleading and do not omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall
not, when so advising Subscriber of such events listed above,
provide Subscriber with any material, nonpublic information regarding the
Company other than to the extent that providing notice to Subscriber of the
occurrence of the events listed in (A) through (C) above constitutes material,
nonpublic information regarding the Company;

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(iii)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any
Registration Statement as soon as reasonably practicable;

  



  

(iv)  upon the occurrence of any event contemplated above, except
for such times as the Company is permitted hereunder to suspend, and has
suspended, the use of a prospectus forming part of a Registration Statement,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as soon as
reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective amendment to such Registration
Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus, or file any other
required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Shares
included therein, such prospectus will not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading;

  



  

(v)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
Shares to be listed on each securities exchange or market, if any, on which
the Common Stock has been listed; and

  



  

(vi)  use its commercially reasonable efforts (A) to take all
other steps necessary to effect the registration of the Shares
contemplated hereby and (B) for so long as the Subscriber holds Shares, to
file all reports and other materials required to be filed by the Exchange Act
so long as the Company remains subject to such requirements and the filing of
such reports and other documents is required for the applicable provisions of
Rule 144 to enable Subscriber to sell the Shares under Rule 144.

  



  

(c)  The Company may delay filing or suspend the use of any
such registration statement if the Company determines, upon advice of legal
counsel, that in order for the registration statement to not contain a
material misstatement or omission, an amendment thereto or a supplement to
the related prospectus would be needed, or if the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company reasonable believes, upon advice of legal counsel, such filing or
use could materially affect a bona fide business or financing transaction of
the Company or would require premature disclosure of information that could
materially adversely affect the Company (each such circumstance, a "
_Suspension Event_ "); provided, however, that the Company may not delay
filing or suspend the use of any registration statement on more than two
occasions or for more than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days, or more
than one hundred twenty (120) total calendar days, in each case during any
twelve-month period. Upon receipt of any written notice from the Company of
the happening of any Suspension Event during the period that the Registration
Statement is effective or if as a result of a Suspension Event the
Registration Statement or related prospectus contains any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made (in the case of the prospectus)
not misleading, the Subscriber agrees that it will (i) immediately
discontinue offers and sales of the Shares under the Registration Statement
until the Subscriber receives (A) (x) copies of a supplemental or amended
prospectus that corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above
and (y) notice that any post-effective amendment has become effective or (B)
notice from the Company that it may resume such offers and sales, and (ii)
maintain the confidentiality of any information included in such written
notice delivered by the Company unless otherwise required by applicable law.
If so directed by the Company, the Subscriber will deliver to the Company or,
in Subscriber's sole discretion destroy, all copies of the prospectus
covering the Shares in the Subscriber's possession; provided, however, that
this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of the prospectus covering
the Shares shall not apply to (i) the extent the Subscriber is required to
retain a copy of such prospectus (A) in order to comply with applicable legal,
regulatory, self-regulatory or professional requirements or (B) in accordance
with a bona fide pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) copies
stored electronically on archival servers as a result of automatic data back-
up.

(d)  The Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Subscriber (to the extent a seller under the Registration Statement), its
officers, directors, partners, members, managers, stockholders, advisers and
agents, and each person who controls the Subscriber (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation,
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees) and expenses
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any
prospectus included in the Registration Statement or any form of prospectus
or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or
any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of
any prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except to the
extent, and only to the extent, that such untrue statements, alleged untrue
statements, omissions or alleged omissions are based upon information or
furnished in writing to the Company by the Subscriber expressly for use
therein. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Company's indemnification
obligations shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Losses or
action if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

(e)  The Subscriber shall, separately and not jointly with any
Other Subscriber, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors,
officers, agents and employees, and each person who controls the Company
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the
Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such
controlling persons, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from
and against all Losses, resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any prospectus
included in the Registration Statement, or any form of prospectus, or in any
amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, or
any form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading to the extent, and
only to the extent, that such untrue statements, alleged untrue statements,
omissions or alleged omissions are based upon information furnished in
writing to the Company by the Subscriber expressly for use therein. In no
event shall the liability of the Subscriber be greater in amount than the
dollar amount of the net proceeds received by the Subscriber upon the sale of
the Shares giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

  



  

(f)  If the indemnification provided under this Section 6 from
the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by
a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to
above shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 6 and
deemed to include any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to
this Section 6(f) from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. Each indemnifying party's obligation to make a
contribution pursuant to this Section 6(f) shall be individual, not joint and
several, and in no event shall the liability of Subscriber hereunder exceed
the net proceeds received by Subscriber upon the sale of the Shares giving
rise to such indemnification obligation.

7.   _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void and of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of: (a) the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto to terminate this Subscription Agreement; (b) such date and time as the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; or (c) written notice by either party to the other party to terminate this Subscription Agreement if the transactions contemplated by this Subscription Agreement are not consummated on or prior to May 15, 2021; _provided_ that (i) nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach hereof prior to the time of termination, and each party will be entitled to any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or damages arising from such breach. The Company shall notify the Subscriber of the termination of the Transaction Agreement promptly after the termination of such agreement and (ii) the provisions of _Sections 8_ through _10_ of this Subscription Agreement will survive any termination of this Subscription Agreement and continue indefinitely.

  



  

8.   _Trust Account Waiver_. The Subscriber hereby represents and warrants that it has read the Prospectus and understands that the Company has established a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and the overallotment shares acquired by its underwriters and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of the Company's public stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by the Company's underwriters, the " _Public Stockholders_ "), and that, except as otherwise described in the Prospectus, the Company may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their Company shares in connection with the consummation of the Company's initial business combination (as such term is used in the Prospectus, the " _Business Combination_ ") or in connection with an extension of its deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the Public Stockholders if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination within 24 months after the closing of the IPO, which is subject to extension by amendment to the Company's organizational documents, (c) with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, amounts necessary to pay for any franchise and income tax obligations and up to $100,000 in dissolution expenses, or (d) to the Company after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of the Company entering into this Subscription Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Subscriber hereby waives any and all right, title and interest, or any claim of any kind they have or may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, and agrees not to seek recourse or make or bring any action, suit, claim or other proceeding against the Trust Account as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Shares, regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability. To the extent the Subscriber commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, as a result of, or arising out of, this Subscription Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Shares, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the Company or its representatives, the Subscriber hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Subscriber's sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit the Subscriber (or any person claiming on its behalf or in lieu of it) to have any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. Notwithstanding anything else in this _Section 8_ to the contrary, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the Subscriber's right, title, interest or claim to the Trust Account by virtue of the Subscriber's record or beneficial ownership of Common Stock of the Company acquired by any means other than pursuant to this Subscription Agreement, including but not limited to any redemption right with respect to any such securities of the Company.

of the Company, provided that Subscriber may transfer or assign all or a
portion of its rights under this Subscription Agreement to an affiliate or to

CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT

(n)  The headings set forth in this Subscription Agreement are
for convenience of reference only and shall not be used in interpreting this
Subscription Agreement. In this Subscription Agreement, unless the context

this Subscription Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa; (ii) "including" (and
with correlative meaning "include") means including without limiting the
generality of any description preceding or succeeding such term and shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation"; and
(iii) the words "herein",  "hereto" and "hereby" and other words of similar
import in this Subscription Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer
to this Subscription Agreement as a whole and not to any particular portion of
this Subscription Agreement. As used in this Subscription Agreement, the
term: (x) "business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or
a legal holiday on which commercial banking institutions in New York, New York
are authorized to close for business (excluding as a result of "stay at
home", "shelter-in-place", "non-essential employee" or any other
similar orders or restrictions or the closure of any physical branch
locations at the direction of any governmental authority so long as the
electronic funds transfer systems, including for wire transfers, of
commercially banking institutions in New York, New York are generally open
for use by customers on such day); (y) "person" shall refer to any individual,
corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability company or other entity or
association, including any governmental or regulatory body, whether acting in
an individual, fiduciary or any other capacity; and (z) "affiliate" shall
mean, with respect to any specified person, any other person or group of
persons acting together that, directly or indirectly, through one or more

means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise). For the avoidance
of doubt, any reference in this Subscription Agreement to an affiliate of the
Company will include the Company's sponsor, Longview Investors LLC.

  



  

(o)  At Closing, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver
such additional documents and take such additional actions as the parties may
reasonably deem practical and necessary in order to consummate the Offering as
contemplated by this Subscription Agreement.

  



  

10.   _Non-Reliance and Exculpation_. The Subscriber acknowledges that it is not relying upon, and has not relied upon, any statement, representation or warranty made by any person other than the statements, representations and warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement in making its investment or decision to invest in the Company. The Subscriber agrees that neither (i) any Other Subscriber pursuant to the Other Subscription Agreements (including the controlling persons, members, officers, directors, partners, agents, or employees of any such Other Subscriber) nor (ii) the Placement Agent, its affiliates or any of its or its affiliates' respective control persons, officers, directors or employees, shall be liable to the Subscriber pursuant to this Subscription Agreement for any action heretofore or hereafter taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in connection with the purchase of the Shares.

  



  

11.   _Disclosure_. The Company shall, by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first (1st) business day immediately following the date of this Subscription Agreement, issue one or more press releases or file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K (collectively, the " _Press Release_ ") disclosing all material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Other Subscription Agreements, the Transaction and any other material, nonpublic information that the Company has provided to Subscriber at any time prior to the filing of the Press Release. Upon the issuance of the Press Release, to the Company's knowledge, Subscriber shall not be in possession of any material, non-public information received from the Company or any of its officers, directors or employees or agents (including the Placement Agent) and Subscriber shall no longer be subject to any confidentiality or similar obligations under any current agreement, whether written or oral with the Company, the Placement Agent or any of their respective affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Subscription Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not publicly disclose the name of Subscriber, its investment adviser, if applicable, or any of its affiliates, or include the name of Subscriber, its investment adviser, if applicable, or any of its affiliates in any press release or in any filing with the SEC or any regulatory agency or trading market, without the prior written consent of Subscriber, except (i) as required by the federal securities law and (ii) to the extent such disclosure is required by law, at the request of the Staff of the SEC or regulatory agency or under the regulations of the NYSE, in which case the Company shall provide Subscriber with prior written notice of such disclosure permitted under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii).

purchased jointly._

income in excess of $200,000, or joint income with  the Subscriber's spouse

commercially reasonable efforts to file a Registration Statement under the
Securities Act promptly, but in any event within sixty (60) days following the

by the Holders from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 under the Securities
Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in
effect) ("Rule 415") on the terms and conditions specified in this
_subsection 2.1.1_ and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable
after the filing thereof, but in no event later than sixty (60)
days following the filing deadline (the "Effectiveness Deadline"); provided,
that the Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to ninety (90) days after
the filing deadline if the Registration Statement is reviewed by, and receives
comments from, the Commission. The Registration Statement filed with the
Commission pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall be a shelf

resale of such Registrable Securities, covering such Registrable

legally available to, and requested by, the Holders. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that another
Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the Registrable
Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable Securities have
ceased to be Registrable Securities. As soon as practicable following the
effective date of a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection
2.1.1_ , but in any event within two (2) business days of such date, the
Company shall notify the Holders of the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement. When effective, a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_subsection 2.1.1_ (including the documents incorporated therein by
reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain
a Misstatement.

2.1.2   _Form S-3_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ("Form
S-3") as soon as practicable after the Company is eligible to use Form S-3.

  



  

2.1.3   _Shelf Takedown_. At any time and from time to time
following the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement required by
_subsection 2.1.1_ or _2.1.2_ , any Holder(s) may request to sell all or a
portion of their Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering that is
registered pursuant to such shelf registration statement (a
"Shelf Underwritten Offering") provided that such Holder(s) (a) reasonably
expect aggregate gross proceeds in excess of $50,000,000 from such Shelf
Underwritten Offering or (b) reasonably expects to sell all of the Registrable
Securities held by such Holder in such Shelf Underwritten Offering but in no
event for less than $10,000,000 in gross proceeds. All requests for a Shelf
Underwritten Offering shall be made by giving written notice to the Company
(the "Shelf Takedown Notice"). Each Shelf Takedown Notice shall specify the
approximate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the Shelf
Underwritten Offering and the expected price range (net of underwriting
discounts and commissions) of such Shelf Underwritten Offering. Within five
(5) business days after receipt of any Shelf Takedown Notice, the Company
shall give written notice of such requested Shelf Underwritten Offering to
all other Holders of Registrable Securities (the "Company Shelf Takedown
Notice") and, subject to reductions consistent with the pro rata calculations
in _subection 2.2.4_, shall include in such Shelf Underwritten Offering all
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written
requests for inclusion therein, within five (5) days after sending the
Company Shelf Takedown Notice. The Company shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of
securities by the Company with the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters selected by the initiating Holder(s) after consultation with the
Company and shall take all such other reasonable actions as are requested by
the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities. In connection with any Shelf
Underwritten Offering contemplated by this _subsection 2.1.3_ , subject to
_Section 3.4_ and _Article IV_ , the underwriting agreement into which each
Holder and the Company shall enter shall contain such representations,
covenants, indemnities and other rights and obligations of the Company and
the selling stockholders as are customary in Underwritten Offerings of
securities by the Company.

  



  

2.2   _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1   _Request for Registration_. Subject to the provisions of
_subsection 2.2.4_ hereof and provided that the Company does not have an
effective Registration Statement pursuant to _subsection 2.1_ outstanding
covering the Registrable Securities, the Holders of at least a majority-in-
interest of the then outstanding number of Registrable Securities held by the
Butterfly Holders or the Sponsor Group Holders (the "Demanding Holders"), in
each case, may make a written demand for Registration of all or part of their
Registrable Securities, which written demand shall describe the amount and
type of securities to be included in such Registration and the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof (such written demand a "Demand
Registration"). The Company shall, within ten (10) days of the Company's
receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in writing, all other Holders of
Registrable Securities of such demand, and each Holder of Registrable
Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of such Holder's
Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration
(each such Holder that includes all or a portion of such Holder's Registrable
Securities in such Registration, a "Requesting Holder") shall so notify the
Company, in writing, within five (5) days after the receipt by the Holder of
the notice from the Company. Upon receipt by the Company of any such written
notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the Company, such Requesting
Holder(s) shall be entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in
a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration and the Company
shall effect, as soon thereafter as practicable, the Registration of all
Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting
Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration, including by filing a
Registration Statement relating thereto as soon as practicable, but not more
than forty-five (45) days immediately after the Company's receipt of the
Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to
effect more than an aggregate of three (3) Registrations pursuant to a Demand
Registration under this _subsection 2.1.1_ with respect to any or all
Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Registration pursuant
to a Demand Registration shall not be counted for such purposes unless a
Registration Statement with respect to such Demand Registration has become
effective and all of the Registrable Securities requested by the Requesting
Holders and the Demanding Holders to be registered on behalf of the
Requesting Holders and the Demanding Holders on such Registration
Statement have been sold, in accordance with _Section 3.1_ of this Agreement.

2.2.2   _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of _subsection 2.2.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration shall not count as a
Registration unless and until (i) the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration
has been declared effective by the Commission and (ii) the Company has
complied with all of its material obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if, after such Registration
Statement has been declared effective, an offering of Registrable Securities
in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is subsequently interfered
with by any stop order or injunction of the Commission, federal or state
court or any other governmental agency, the Registration Statement with
respect to such Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared
effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed,
rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders initiating such Demand Registration
thereafter affirmatively elect to continue with such Registration and
accordingly notify the Company in writing, but in no event later than five
(5) days, of such election; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall
not be obligated or required to file another Registration Statement until the
Registration Statement that has been previously filed with respect to a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration becomes effective or is
subsequently terminated.

  



  

2.2.3   _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of
_subsection 2.2.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
so advise the Company as part of their Demand Registration that the offering
of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be
in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such Demanding
Holder or Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable Securities in
such Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in
such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable
Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent provided herein. All
such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.2.3_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders initiating the Demand Registration, which Underwriter(s) shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

2.2.4   _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders
and the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar amount or
number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the Requesting
Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other Common Stock
or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell and the
Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been requested pursuant
to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by any
other stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten
Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing,
the distribution method, or the probability of success of such offering (such
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Securities"), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) (pro
rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included in
such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities that the Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders have
requested be included in such Underwritten Registration) that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (i), the Registrable Securities of Holders (pro rata, based
on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has so
requested) exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities
pursuant to _subsection 2.3.1_ hereof, without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number
of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
the Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and
(iv) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Common Stock or
other equity securities of other persons or entities that the Company is
obligated to register in a Registration pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.2.5   _Demand Registration Withdrawal_. A majority-in-interest
of the Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration or a majority-in-
interest of the Requesting Holders (if any), pursuant to a Registration under
_subsection 2.2.1_ shall have the right to withdraw from a Registration
pursuant to such Demand Registration or a Shelf Underwritten Offering pursuant
to _subsection 2.1.3_ for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of
their intention to withdraw from such Registration at least two (2) business
days prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to the Registration of their Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Demand Registration (or in the case of an Underwritten
Registration pursuant to _Section 2.1.1_ or _2.2.4_ at least five (5) business
days prior to the time of pricing of the applicable offering).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration prior to its withdrawal under
this _subsection 2.2.5_.

2.3   _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1   _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering
of equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or
exchangeable for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own account
or for the account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by
the stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
_Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ hereof), other than a Registration Statement (i)
filed in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii)
for a rights offering or an exchange offer or offering of securities solely
to the Company's then existing stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt
that is convertible into equity securities of the Company or (iv) for a
dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall give written notice of
such proposed filing to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities as soon
as practicable but not less than ten (10) days before the anticipated filing
date of such Registration Statement, which notice shall (A) describe the
amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended
method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter
or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all of the
Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the sale
of such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in
writing within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice (such
Registration a "Piggyback Registration"). The Company shall, in good faith,
cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback
Registration and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this
_subsection 2.3.1_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same
terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in
such Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. All such Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this
_subsection 2.3.1_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary
form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the
Company. Holders agree that, except as required by applicable law, the
Holders shall treat as confidential any notice or other communication in
connection with any Piggyback Registration and shall not disclose or use the
information contained in such notice without the prior written consent of the
Company until such time as the information contained therein is or becomes
public, other than as a result of disclosure by a Holder of Registrable
Shares in breach of the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

2.3.2   _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a
Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of the Common Stock that the Company desires
to sell, taken together with (i) the Common Stock, if any, as to which
Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof, and (iii)
the Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights of
other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities,
then:

  



  

(a)  If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's
account, the Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, the
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to 
_subsection 2.3.1_ hereof, pro rata, based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities that each Holder has so requested, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Common Stock, if any, as to which
Registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back
registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(b)  If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or
entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company
shall include in any such Registration (A) first, the Common Stock or other
equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than
the Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.3.1_ , pro rata, based on
the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has requested
be included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be included in such
Underwritten Registration, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (D)
fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), the Common Stock or
other equity securities for the account of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.3.3   _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of
Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a
Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of
his, her or its intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration at
least two (2) business days prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such Piggyback
Registration (or in the case of an Underwritten Registration pursuant to Rule
415, at least five (5) business days prior to the time of pricing of the
applicable offering). The Company (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons pursuant
to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration
Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.3.3_.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

2.3.4   _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes
of clarity, any Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof shall
not be counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected
under _Section 2.2_ hereof.

  



  

2.4   _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the
period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good
faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred
and twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company initiated
Registration and provided that the Company has delivered written notice to the
Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection
2.2.1_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable
efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become effective;
(B) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company
and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly
underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board such
Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer or the
Secretary of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board
it would be seriously detrimental to the Company for such Registration
Statement to be filed in the near future and that it is therefore essential
to defer the filing of such Registration Statement. In such event, the
Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more
than ninety (90) days; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
defer its obligation in this manner more than once in any 12-month period.

include such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement.
At least three (3) business days prior to the anticipated filing date of any

efforts to notify each Holder of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement in writing (which may be by email) of the information
reasonably necessary about the Holder to keep such Holder's
Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to
include or keep a Holder's Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement
to the extent the Company has not received such information, and received any
other reasonably requested agreements or certificates, on or prior to the
fifth (5th) business day prior to the first anticipated filing date of a

indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary
documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting

16

 



    



  

3.5   _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus
contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until such Holder has received copies
of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such
notice), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time
would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the
inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Company's control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the
Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of,
such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event
more than forty-five (45) days, determined in good faith by the Company to be
necessary for such purpose. In the event the Company exercises its rights
under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon
their receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus
relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell
Registrable Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of
the expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights under this
_Section 3.5_.

  



  

3.6   _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a
reporting company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant
to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants
that it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request,
all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell
shares of the Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated
thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal opinions, it
being acknowledged by the Holders that the securities of the Company will not
be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
Act, until, among other requirements, at least one year has elapsed from the
time that the Company has filed current Form 10 information with the
Commission reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.
Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a
written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

  



  

3.7   _Lock-up Restrictions_.

  



  

3.7.1  During the Founder Shares Lock-up Period, none of the
Sponsor Group Holders shall, and during the Butterfly Shares Lock-up Period,
none of the Butterfly Holders shall: offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge,
grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of or
distribute any shares of Common Stock or Class B Common Stock that are subject
to the applicable Lock-up Period or any securities convertible into,
exercisable for, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive
shares of Common Stock or Class B Common Stock that are subject to the
applicable Lock-up Period, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, that is
owned directly by such Holder (including securities held as a custodian) or
with respect to which such Holder has beneficial ownership within the rules
and regulations of the Commission (such securities that are subject to an
applicable Lock-up Period, the "Restricted Securities"), other than any
transfer to an affiliate of a Holder or to a Permitted Transferee, as
applicable. The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude each
Holder, as applicable, from engaging in any hedging or other transaction with
respect to Restricted Securities which is designed to or which reasonably
could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of the
Restricted Securities even if such Restricted Securities would be disposed of
by someone other than such Existing Holder. Such prohibited hedging or other
transactions include any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any
right (including any put or call option) with respect to any of the Restricted
Securities of the applicable Holder, or with respect to any security that
includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such
Restricted Securities.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

3.7.2  Each Holder hereby represents and warrants that it now has
and, except as contemplated by this subsection 3.7.2 for the duration of the
applicable Lock-up Period, will have good and marketable title to its
Restricted Securities, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims
that could impact the ability of such Holder to comply with the foregoing
restrictions. Each Holder agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer
instructions with the Company's transfer agent and registrar against the
transfer of any Restricted Securities during the applicable Lock-up Period.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
  
  _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_

  



  

4.1   _Indemnification_.

  



  

4.1.1  The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted
by law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and
agents and each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or
contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing to the
Company by such Holder expressly for use therein.

  



  

4.1.2  In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish
to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration
Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify
the Company, its directors and officers and agents and each person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation' reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in
any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly
for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation to indemnify
shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable
Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities
shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by
such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify
the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

4.1.3  Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i)
give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with
respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give
prompt notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification
hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the
indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party
to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party
shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the
indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by
such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of
money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the
terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.

  



  

4.1.4  The indemnification provided for under this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling
person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of
securities. The Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities
participating in an offering also agrees to make such provisions as are
reasonably requested by any indemnified party for contribution to such party
in the event the Company's or such Holder's indemnification is unavailable
for any reason.

  



  

4.1.5  If the indemnification provided under Section 4.1 hereof
from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless
an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action and the benefits received by
such indemnifying party or indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering
giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed
to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ , 
_4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection
4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_  from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

provided that such waiver will not be effective against the waiving party
unless it is in writing, is signed by such party, and specifically refers to
this Agreement. Waivers may be made in advance or after the right waived has
arisen or the breach or default waived has occurred. Any waiver may be
conditional. No waiver of any breach of any agreement or provision
herein contained shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding
breach thereof nor of any other agreement or provision herein contained. No
waiver or extension of time for performance of any obligations or acts shall
be deemed a waiver or extension of the time for performance of any other
obligations or acts.

  



  

5.10   _Remedies Cumulative_. In the event that the Company fails to
observe or perform any covenant or agreement to be observed or performed
under this Agreement, the Holders may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights by suit in equity or action at law, whether for specific performance
of any term contained in this Agreement or for an injunction against the

any one or more of such actions, without being required to post a bond. None
of the rights, powers or remedies conferred under this Agreement shall be

warrants that no person, other than the Holders with respect to Registrable

referred to in Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder)
or (B) the Holders of all Registrable Securities are permitted to sell the

AGREEMENT

  



  

1.   _Company Stockholder Written Consent and Related Matters_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) following the time at which the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act, the Stockholders shall duly execute and deliver to the
Company and Longview the Company Stockholder Written Consent under which they
shall irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the matters, actions and
proposals contemplated by _Section 5.13(b)_ (Transaction Support Agreements;
Company Stockholder Approval; PIPE Investor Subscription Agreements) of the
Business Combination Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the first
sentence of this _Section 1(a)_ , prior to the Closing, the Stockholders shall
vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject Company Shares against and withhold
consent with respect to (A) any Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) any other
matter, action or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in (x)
a breach of any of the Company's covenants, agreements or obligations under
the Business Combination Agreement or (y) any of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in _Sections 6.1_  or _6.2_ of the Business Combination Agreement
not being satisfied.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Longview,
each Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Longview or any individual
designated by Longview as such Stockholder's agent, attorney-in-fact and proxy
(with full power of substitution and resubstituting), for and in the name,
place and stead of such Stockholder, to attend on behalf of such Stockholder
any meeting of the Company Stockholders with respect to the matters described
in _Section 1(a)_ , to include such Stockholder's Subject Company Shares in
any computation for purposes of establishing a quorum at any such meeting of
the Company Stockholders, to vote (or cause to be voted) such Stockholder's
Subject Company Shares or consent (or withhold consent) with respect to any
of the matters described in _Section 1(a)_ in connection with any meeting of
the Company Stockholders or any action by written consent by the Company
Stockholders (including the Company Stockholder Written Consent), in each
case, in the event that such Stockholder fails to perform or otherwise comply
with the covenants, agreements or obligations set forth in _Section 1(a)_.

  



  

(c)  The proxy granted by each Stockholder pursuant to _Section
1(b)_ is coupled with an interest sufficient at law to support an irrevocable
proxy and is granted in consideration for Longview entering into the Business
Combination Agreement and agreeing to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. The proxy granted by each Stockholder pursuant to
_Section 1(b)_ is also a durable proxy and shall survive the bankruptcy,
dissolution, death, incapacity or other inability to act by such
Stockholder and shall revoke any and all prior proxies granted by such
Stockholder with respect to its Subject Company Shares. The vote or consent
of the proxyholder in accordance with _Section 1(b)_ and with respect to the
matters in _Section 1(a)_ shall control in the event of any conflict between
such vote or consent by the proxyholder of the Subject Company Shares and a
vote or consent by a Stockholder of the Subject Company Shares (or any other
Person with the power to vote the Subject Company Shares) with respect to the
matters in _Section 1(a)_. The proxyholder may not exercise the proxy granted
pursuant to _Section 1(b)_ on any matter except those provided in _Section
1(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder may vote the
Subject Company Shares on all other matters, subject to, for the avoidance of
doubt, the other applicable covenants, agreements and obligations set forth
in this Agreement.

2.   _Other Covenants and Agreements_.

  



  

(a)  Each Stockholder shall be bound by and subject to Sections
5.3(a) (Confidentiality) and _Section 5.4(a)_ (Public Announcements) of the
Business Combination Agreement to the same extent as such provisions apply to
the parties to the Business Combination Agreement, as if such Stockholder is
directly party thereto, and each Stockholder and Dr. Rothberg shall be bound
by and subject to the first sentence of _Section 5.6(a)_ (Exclusive Dealing)
and _Section 8.18_ (Trust Account Waiver) of the Business Combination
Agreement to the same extent as such provisions apply to the Company, as if
such Stockholder is directly party thereto. Dr. Rothberg shall, in his
capacity has Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, cause to be
done such further acts and things as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
to cause the Company to fulfill its obligations under the Business
Combination Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

  



  

(b)  Each Stockholder and Dr. Rothberg acknowledges and agrees
that Longview and the other Longview Parties are entering into the Business
Combination Agreement in reliance upon such Stockholder entering into this
Agreement and agreeing to be bound by, and perform, or otherwise comply with,
as applicable, the agreements, covenants and obligations contained in this
Agreement and but for such Stockholder and Dr. Rothberg entering into this
Agreement and agreeing to be bound by, and perform, or otherwise comply with,
as applicable, the agreements, covenants and obligations contained in this
Agreement, Longview and the other Longview Parties would not have entered
into or agreed to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Business
Combination Agreement.

  



  

3.   _Stockholder Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Stockholders and Dr. Rothberg represents and warrants to Longview, on behalf of him or itself, as follows:

  



  

(a)  Each Stockholder is a limited liability company, trust or
other applicable entity duly organized or formed, as applicable, validly
existing and in good standing (or the equivalent thereof, if applicable, in
each case, with respect to the jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing or any equivalent thereof) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
formation or organization (as applicable).

  



  

(b)  Each Stockholder has the requisite limited liability
company, trust or other similar power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those covenants, agreements and
obligations hereunder that relate to the provisions of the Business
Combination Agreement), and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement has been duly authorized
by all necessary limited liability company, trust (or other similar) action
on the part of each Stockholder. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Stockholders and Dr. Rothberg and constitutes a
valid, legal and binding agreement of each Stockholder and Dr. Rothberg
(assuming that this Agreement is duly authorized, executed and delivered by
Longview), enforceable against each Stockholder and Dr. Rothberg in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting generally the enforcement
of creditors' rights and subject to general principles of equity).

(c)  No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required on the part
of any Stockholder or Dr. Rothberg with respect to such Stockholder's or Dr.
Rothberg's execution, delivery or performance of its covenants, agreements or
obligations under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those
covenants, agreements and obligations under this Agreement that relate to the
provisions of the Business Combination Agreement) or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for any consents, approvals,
authorizations, designations, declarations, waivers or filings, the absence
of which would not adversely affect the ability of the Stockholders or Dr.
Rothberg to perform, or otherwise comply with, any of its covenants,
agreements or obligations hereunder in any material respect.

  



  

(d)  None of the execution or delivery of this Agreement by the
Stockholders and Dr. Rothberg, the performance by the Stockholders and Dr.
Rothberg of any of its covenants, agreements or obligations under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those covenants, agreements
and obligations under this Agreement that relate to the provisions of the
Business Combination Agreement) or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will, directly or indirectly (with or without due notice
or lapse of time or both) (i) result in any breach of any provision of any
Stockholder's Governing Documents, (ii) result in a violation or breach of,
or constitute a default or give rise to any right of termination, Consent,
cancellation, amendment, modification, suspension, revocation or acceleration
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which any

Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement, the Company Stockholders
Agreements and any Contract with respect to a Permitted Transfer, no
Stockholder is party to or bound by (i) any option, warrant, purchase right,
or other Contract that would (either alone or in connection with one or more
events, developments or events (including the satisfaction or waiver of any
conditions precedent)) require such Stockholder to Transfer any of its Subject
Company Shares or (ii) any voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect
to the voting or Transfer of any of its Subject Company Shares.

each Stockholder's knowledge, threatened against Dr. Rothberg or such
Stockholder that, if adversely decided or resolved, would reasonably be

otherwise comply with, any of its covenants, agreements or obligations under
this Agreement in any material respect.

it and its Representatives have deemed necessary to enable it to make an
informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, the other Ancillary Documents to which it is or will be a
party and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

(h)  In entering into this Agreement and the other Ancillary

or any other Person, either express or implied, and such Stockholder, on its

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by Dr. Rothberg, the Stockholders and Longview. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

   | 3.| _SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The number of Shares that may be issued from time to time pursuant
to this Plan shall be the sum of: (i) eleven percent (11%) of the outstanding
Shares of Common Stock, determined immediately following the Closing less
2,602,954; (ii) that number of shares of common stock remaining available for
issuance under the Company's 2012 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity
Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan"), determined immediately following the
Closing, multiplied by 1.0383, which number shall not exceed 2,506,938; and
(iii) that number of shares of Class A Common Stock attributable to awards
granted under the Company's 2012 Plan that are forfeited, expire or are
cancelled without delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock or which result
in the forfeiture of shares of Class A Common Stock back to the Company on or
after the Closing, which number shall not exceed 28,226,972.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Subparagraph (a) above, on the first day of each
fiscal year of the Company during the period beginning in fiscal year 2021
and ending on the second day of fiscal year 2030, the number of Shares that
may be issued from time to time pursuant to the Plan, shall be increased
automatically by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 4% of the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock on such date and (ii) an amount determined
by the Administrator (the "Annual Increase").

  



  

(c) If an Option ceases to be "outstanding", in whole or in part (other
than by exercise), or if the Company shall reacquire (at not more than its
original issuance price) any Shares issued pursuant to a Stock Grant or Stock-
Based Award, or if any Stock Right expires or is forfeited, cancelled, or
otherwise terminated or results in any Shares not being issued, the unissued
or reacquired Shares which were subject to such Stock Right shall again be
available for issuance from time to time pursuant to this Plan;
provided, however, that the number of Shares underlying any awards under the
Plan that are retained or repurchased on the exercise of an Option or the
vesting or issuance of any Stock Right to cover the exercise price and/or tax
withholding required by the Company in connection with vesting shall not be
added back to the Shares available for issuance under the Plan; and provided,
further that, in the case of ISOs, the foregoing provisions shall be subject
to any limitations under the Code. In addition, any Shares repurchased using
exercise price proceeds will not be available for issuance under the Plan.

  



  

(d) The maximum number of Shares available for grant under the Plan as
ISOs will be equal to 250,000,000. The limits set forth in this Paragraph 3
will be construed to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 422.

  



  

(e) The Administrator may grant Substitute Awards under the Plan. To
the extent consistent with the requirements of Section 422 and
the regulations thereunder and other applicable legal requirements (including
applicable stock exchange requirements), Shares issued in respect of
Substitute Awards will be in addition to and will not reduce the shares
available under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Substitute
Award is settled in cash or expires, becomes unexercisable, terminates or is
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company without the issuance or retention
of Shares, the Shares previously subject to such Award will not be available
for future issuance under the Plan. The Administrator will determine the
extent to which the terms and conditions of the Plan apply to Substitute
Awards, if at all; provided, however, that Substitute Awards will not be
subject to the limits described in Paragraph 4(c) below.

which case the Committee shall be the Administrator. Subject to the provisions
of the Plan, the Administrator is authorized to:

make all rules and determinations which it deems necessary or advisable for
the administration of the Plan;

Stock Rights to be granted and any other cash compensation paid to any non-
employee director in any calendar year, exceed $750,000, increased to
$1,000,000 in the year in which such non-employee director initially joins
the Board of Directors.

  



  

(d) Specify the terms and conditions upon which a Stock Right or Stock
Rights may be granted provided that no dividends or dividend
equivalents shall be paid on any Stock Right prior to the vesting of the
underlying Shares.

  



  

(e) Amend any term or condition of any outstanding Stock Right,
provided that (i) such term or condition as amended is not prohibited by the
Plan and (ii) any such amendment shall not impair the rights of a Participant
under any Stock Right previously granted without such Participant's consent
or in the event of death of the Participant the Participant's Survivors.

  



  

(f) Determine and make any adjustments in the Performance Goals
included in any Performance-Based Awards; and

  



  

(g) Adopt any sub-plans applicable to residents of any specified
jurisdiction as it deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with or
take advantage of any tax or other laws applicable to the Company, any
Affiliate or to Participants or to otherwise facilitate the administration of
the Plan, which sub-plans may include additional restrictions or conditions
applicable to Stock Rights or Shares issuable pursuant to a Stock Right;

  



  

Subject to the foregoing, the interpretation and construction by the
Administrator of any provisions of the Plan or of any Stock Right granted
under it shall be final, unless otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors, if the Administrator is the Committee. In addition, if the
Administrator is the Committee, the Board of Directors may take any action
under the Plan that would otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee.

  



  

To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Board of Directors or the
Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and
powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any portion
of its responsibilities and powers to any other person selected by it. The
Board of Directors or the Committee may revoke any such allocation or
delegation at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only the Board of
Directors or the Committee shall be authorized to grant a Stock Right to any
director of the Company or to any  "officer" of the Company as defined by
Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act.

  



   | 5.| _ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Administrator will, in its sole discretion, name the Participants in the
Plan; provided, however, that each Participant must be an Employee,
director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate at the time a Stock
Right is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may
authorize the grant of a Stock Right to a person in anticipation of such
person becoming an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an
Affiliate, provided, that the actual grant of such Stock Right shall be
conditioned upon such person becoming eligible to become a Participant at or
prior to the time of the execution of the Agreement evidencing such Stock
Right. ISOs may be granted only to Employees. Non-Qualified Options, Stock
Grants and Stock-Based Awards may be granted to any Employee, director or
Consultant of the Company or an Affiliate. The granting of any Stock Right to
any individual shall neither entitle that individual to, nor disqualify that
individual from, participation in any other grant of Stock Rights or any grant
under any other benefit plan established by the Company or any Affiliate for
Employees, directors or Consultants.

   | 6.| _TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each Option shall be set forth in an Option Agreement duly executed by the
Company and, to the extent required by law or requested by the Company,
by the Participant. The Administrator may provide that Options be granted
subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the terms and
conditions specifically required under this Plan, as the Administrator may
deem appropriate including, without limitation, subsequent approval by the
shareholders of the Company of this Plan or any amendments thereto. The Option
Agreements shall be subject to at least the following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a) _Non-Qualified Options_ : Each Option intended to be a Non-
Qualified Option shall be subject to the terms and conditions which the
Administrator determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the
Company, subject to the following minimum standards for any such Non-
Qualified Option:

  



  

(i)   _Exercise Price_ : Each Option Agreement shall state the
exercise price (per share) of the Shares covered by each Option which
exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator and shall be at least
equal to the Fair Market Value per share of the Class A Common Stock on the
date of grant of the Option.

  



  

(ii)   _Number of Shares_ : Each Option Agreement shall state the
number of Shares to which it pertains.

  



  

(iii)   _Vesting_ : Each Option Agreement shall state the date or

longer be exercised, and may provide that the Option rights accrue or become
exercisable in installments over a period of months or years, or upon the
occurrence of certain performance conditions or the attainment of stated goals
or events.

  



  

(iv)   _Term of Option_ : Each Option shall terminate not more than
ten years from the date of the grant or at such earlier time as the Option
Agreement may provide.

  



  

(b) _ISOs_ : Each Option intended to be an ISO shall be issued
only to an Employee who is deemed to be a resident of the United States for
tax purposes, and shall be subject to the following terms and conditions,
with such additional restrictions or changes as the Administrator determines
are appropriate but not in conflict with Section 422 and relevant regulations
and rulings of the Internal Revenue Service:

  



  

(i)   _Minimum Standards_ : The ISO shall meet the minimum
standards required of Non-Qualified Options, as described in Paragraph 6(a)
above, except clause (i) and (iv) thereunder.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(ii) _Exercise Price_ : Immediately before the ISO is granted, if
the Participant owns, directly or by reason of the applicable attribution
rules in Section 424(d) of the Code:

  



   | A.| 10% _or less_ of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company or an Affiliate, the exercise price per share of the
Shares covered by each ISO shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market
Value per share of the Class A Common Stock on the date of grant of the
Option; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | B.| More than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company or an Affiliate, the exercise price per share of the
Shares covered by each ISO shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market
Value per share of the Class A Common Stock on the date of grant of the
Option. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| _Term of Option_ : For Participants who own: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| 10% _or less_ of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company or an Affiliate, each ISO shall terminate not more than
ten years from the date of the grant or at such earlier time as the
Option Agreement may provide; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | B.| More than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company or an Affiliate, each ISO shall terminate not more than
five years from the date of the grant or at such earlier time as the Option
Agreement may provide. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| _Limitation on Yearly Exercise_ : To the extent that aggregate
Fair Market Value (determined on the date each ISO is granted) of the Shares
with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by the
Participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be
treated as Non-Qualified Options even if denominated ISOs at grant. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(c)  Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving
the Company (which term includes, without limitation, any stock dividend,
stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization,
merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares)
or as otherwise contemplated by Paragraph 24 below, the Company may not,
without obtaining stockholder approval, (i) amend the terms of outstanding
Options to reduce the exercise price of such Options, (ii) cancel outstanding
Options in exchange for Options that have an exercise price that is less than
the exercise price value of the original Options, or (iii) cancel outstanding
Options that have an exercise price greater than the Fair Market Value of a
Share on the date of such cancellation in exchange for cash or other
consideration.

  



   | 7.| _TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK GRANTS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each Stock Grant to a Participant shall state the principal terms in an
Agreement duly executed by the Company and, to the extent required by law
or requested by the Company, by the Participant. The Agreement shall be in a
form approved by the Administrator and shall contain terms and conditions
which the Administrator determines to be appropriate and in the best interest
of the Company, subject to the following minimum standards:

  



  

(a)  Each Agreement shall state the purchase price per Share, if
any, of the Shares covered by each Stock Grant, which purchase price shall be
determined by the Administrator on the date of the grant of the Stock Grant;

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(b)  Each Agreement shall state the number of Shares to which
the Stock Grant pertains;

  



  

(c)  Each Agreement shall include the terms of any right of the
Company to restrict or reacquire the Shares subject to the Stock Grant,
including the time period or attainment of Performance Goals or such other
performance criteria upon which such rights shall accrue and the purchase
price therefor, if any; and

  



  

(d)  Dividends (other than stock dividends to be issued pursuant
to Paragraph 24 of the Plan) may accrue but shall not be paid prior to the
time, and may be paid only to the extent that, the restrictions or rights to
reacquire the Shares subject to the Stock Grant lapse. Any entitlement to
dividend equivalents or similar entitlements will be established and
administered either consistent with an exemption from, or in compliance with
the applicable requirements of Section 409A.

  



   | 8.| _TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Administrator shall have the right to grant other Stock-Based Awards
based upon the Class A Common Stock having such terms and conditions as the
Administrator may determine, including, without limitation, the grant of
Shares based upon certain conditions, the grant of securities convertible
into Shares and the grant of SARs, phantom stock awards or stock units. The
principal terms of each Stock-Based Award shall be set forth in an Agreement,
duly executed by the Company and, to the extent required by law or requested
by the Company, by the Participant. The Agreement shall be in a form approved
by the Administrator and shall contain terms and conditions which the
Administrator determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the
Company. Each Agreement shall include the terms of any right of the Company
including the right to terminate the Stock-Based Award without the
issuance of Shares, the terms of any vesting conditions, Performance Goals or
events upon which Shares shall be issued, provided that dividends (other than
stock dividends to be issued pursuant to Paragraph 24 of the Plan) or dividend
equivalents may accrue but shall not be paid prior to and may be paid only to
the extent that the Shares subject to the Stock-Based Award vest. Under no
circumstances may the Agreement covering SARs (a) have an exercise or base
price (per share) that is less than the Fair Market Value per share of Class
A Common Stock on the date of grant or (b) expire more than ten years
following the date of grant.

  



   | 9.| _PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Committee shall determine whether, with respect to a performance period,
the applicable Performance Goals have been met with respect to a
given Participant and, if they have, to so certify and ascertain the amount
of the applicable Performance-Based Award. No Performance-Based Awards will
be issued for such performance period until such certification is made by the
Committee. The number of Shares issued in respect of a Performance-Based
Award determined by the Committee for a performance period shall be paid to
the Participant at such time as determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion after the end of such performance period, and any dividends
(other than stock dividends to be issued pursuant to Paragraph 24 of the
Plan) or dividend equivalents that accrue shall only be paid in respect of
the number of Shares earned in respect of such Performance-Based Award.

  



   | 10.| _EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND ISSUE OF SHARES._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

An Option (or any part or installment thereof) shall be exercised by giving
written notice to the Company or its designee (in a form acceptable to
the Administrator, which may include electronic notice), together with
provision for payment of the aggregate exercise price in accordance with this
Paragraph for the Shares as to which the Option is being exercised, and upon
compliance with any other condition(s) set forth in the Option Agreement.
Such notice shall be signed by the person exercising the Option (which
signature may be provided electronically in a form acceptable to the
Administrator), shall state the number of Shares with respect to which the
Option is being exercised and shall contain any representation required by
the Plan or the Option Agreement. Payment of the exercise price for the
Shares as to which such Option is being exercised shall be made (a) in United
States dollars in cash or by check; or (b) at the discretion of the
Administrator, through delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock held for at
least six months (if required to avoid negative accounting treatment) having
a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of the exercise to the
aggregate cash exercise price for the number of Shares as to which the Option
is being exercised; or (c) at the discretion of the Administrator, by having
the Company retain from the Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the
Option, a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of
exercise to the aggregate exercise price for the number of Shares as to which
the Option is being exercised; or (d) at the discretion of the Administrator,
in accordance with a cashless exercise program established with a
securities brokerage firm, and approved by the Administrator; or (e) at the
discretion of the Administrator, by any combination of (a), (b), (c) and (d)
above or (f) at the discretion of the Administrator, by payment of such other
lawful consideration as the Administrator may determine. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrator shall accept only such payment on exercise of an
ISO as is permitted by Section 422.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

The Company shall then reasonably promptly deliver the Shares as to which
such Option was exercised to the Participant (or to the
Participant's Survivors, as the case may be). In determining what constitutes
"reasonably promptly," it is expressly understood that the issuance and
delivery of the Shares may be delayed by the Company if the Administrator
determines it is necessary to comply with any law or regulation (including,
without limitation, federal securities laws) that requires the Company to take
any action with respect to the Shares prior to their issuance. The Shares
shall, upon delivery, be fully paid, non-assessable Shares.

  



   | 11.| _PAYMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK GRANTS
AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND ISSUE OF SHARES._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award requiring payment of a purchase price
for the Shares as to which such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award is
being granted shall be made (a) in United States dollars in cash or by check;
or (b) at the discretion of the Administrator, through delivery of shares of
Class A Common Stock held for at least six months (if required to avoid
negative accounting treatment) and having a Fair Market Value equal as of the
date of payment to the purchase price of the Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award;
or (c) by delivery of a promissory note, if the Board of Directors has
expressly authorized the loan of funds to the Participant for the purpose of
enabling or assisting the Participant to effect such purchase; (d) at the
discretion of the Administrator, by any combination of (a) through (c) above;
or (e) at the discretion of the Administrator, by payment of such other lawful
consideration as the Administrator may determine.

  



  

The Company shall when required by the applicable Agreement, reasonably
promptly deliver the Shares as to which such Stock Grant or Stock-Based
Award was made to the Participant (or to the Participant's Survivors, as the
case may be), subject to any escrow provision set forth in the applicable
Agreement. In determining what constitutes "reasonably promptly," it is
expressly understood that the issuance and delivery of the Shares may be
delayed by the Company if the Administrator determines it is necessary to
comply with any law or regulation (including, without limitation, federal
securities laws) which requires the Company to take any action with respect
to the Shares prior to their issuance.

  



   | 12.| _RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

No Participant to whom a Stock Right has been granted shall have rights as a
shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by such Stock Right
except after due exercise of an Option or issuance of Shares as set forth in
any Agreement, tender of the aggregate exercise or purchase price, if any,
for the Shares being purchased and registration of the Shares in the Company's
share register in the name of the Participant.

  



  

   

9

 



    



   | 13.| _ASSIGNABILITY AND TRANSFERABILITY OF STOCK RIGHTS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

By its terms, a Stock Right granted to a Participant shall not be
transferable by the Participant other than (i) by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution, or (ii) as approved by the Administrator in its
discretion and set forth in the applicable Agreement provided that no Stock
Right may be transferred by a Participant for value. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, an ISO transferred except in compliance with clause (i) above
shall no longer qualify as an ISO. The designation of a beneficiary of a Stock
Right by a Participant, with the prior approval of the Administrator and in
such form as the Administrator shall prescribe, shall not be deemed a transfer
prohibited by this Paragraph. Except as provided above during the
Participant's lifetime a Stock Right shall only be exercisable by or issued
to such Participant (or his or her legal representative) and shall not be
assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar
process. Any attempted transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other
disposition of any Stock Right or of any rights granted thereunder
contrary to the provisions of this Plan, or the levy of any attachment or
similar process upon a Stock Right, shall be null and void.

  



   | 14.| _EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE OTHER THAN
FOR CAUSE OR DEATH OR DISABILITY._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement in the event
of a termination of service (whether as an Employee, director or Consultant)
with the Company or an Affiliate before the Participant has exercised an
Option, the following rules apply:

  



  

(a)  A Participant who ceases to be an Employee, director or
Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate (for any reason other than
termination for Cause, Disability, or death for which events there are special
rules in Paragraphs 15, 16, and 17, respectively), may exercise any Option
granted to such Participant to the extent that the Option is exercisable on
the date of such termination of service, but only within such term as the
Administrator has designated in a Participant's Option Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Except as provided in Subparagraph (c) below, or Paragraph
16 or 17, in no event may an Option intended to be an ISO, be exercised later
than three months after the Participant's termination of employment.

  



  

(c)  The provisions of this Paragraph, and not the provisions of
Paragraph 16 or 17, shall apply to a Participant who subsequently becomes
Disabled or dies after the termination of employment, director status or
consultancy; provided, however, in the case of a Participant's Disability or
death within three months after the termination of employment, director status
or consultancy, the Participant or the Participant's Survivors may exercise
the Option within one year after the date of the Participant's termination of
service, but in no event after the date of expiration of the term of the
Option.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
subsequent to a Participant's termination of employment, termination of
director status or termination of consultancy, but prior to the exercise of an
Option, the Administrator determines that, either prior or subsequent to the
Participant's termination, the Participant engaged in conduct which would
constitute Cause, then such Participant shall forthwith cease to have any
right to exercise any Option.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(e)  A Participant to whom an Option has been granted under the
Plan who is absent from the Company or an Affiliate because of temporary
disability (any disability other than a Disability as defined in Paragraph 1
hereof), or who is on leave of absence for any purpose, shall not, during the
period of any such absence, be deemed, by virtue of such absence alone, to
have terminated such Participant's employment, director status or consultancy
with the Company or with an Affiliate, except as the Administrator may
otherwise expressly provide; provided, however, that, for ISOs, any leave of
absence granted by the Administrator of greater than three months, unless
pursuant to a contract or statute that guarantees the right to reemployment,
shall cause such ISO to become a Non-Qualified Option on the date that is six
months following the commencement of such leave of absence.

  



  

(f)  Except as required by law or as set forth in a
Participant's Option Agreement, Options granted under the Plan shall not be
affected by any change of a Participant's status within or among the Company
and any Affiliates, so long as the Participant continues to be an Employee,
director or Consultant of the Company or any Affiliate.

  



  

(g)  Except as otherwise set forth in a Participant's Option
Agreement, if a Participant ceases to be an Employee, director or Consultant
of the Company or any Affiliate but upon cessation of such services
immediately becomes an Employee, director or Consultant of a 4Catalyzer
Corporation, Options granted under the Plan shall cease vesting in accordance
with the Participant's Option Agreement but shall remain exercisable until
the earliest of: (i) three months from the date when the Participant is
no longer providing services as an Employee, director or Consultant to any
4Catalyzer Corporation for any reason other than for Cause, death, or
Disability; (ii) three months from the date when the company to which the
Participant is providing services as an Employee, director or Consultant is
no longer a 4Catalyzer Corporation; (ii) one year from the date of the
Participant's death or Disability; (iii) immediately upon notification by a
4Catalyzer Corporation that the Participant is being terminated by a
4Catalyzer Corporation for Cause; (iv) the expiration date of the Option as
set forth in the Participant's Option Agreement; or (v) the termination of
the Option in accordance with Paragraph 23 or 24 of the Plan.

  



   | 15.| _EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR CAUSE._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement, the
following rules apply if the Participant's service (whether as an Employee,
director or Consultant) with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated for
Cause prior to the time that all his or her outstanding Options have been
exercised:

  



  

(a)  All outstanding and unexercised Options as of the time the
Participant is notified his or her service is terminated for Cause will
immediately be forfeited.

  



  

(b)  Cause is not limited to events which have occurred prior to
a Participant's termination of service, nor is it necessary that the
Administrator's finding of Cause occur prior to termination. If the
Administrator determines, subsequent to a Participant's termination of
service but prior to the exercise of an Option, that either prior or
subsequent to the Participant's termination the Participant engaged in
conduct which would constitute Cause, then the right to exercise any Option is
forfeited.

  



   | 16.| _EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR DISABILITY._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement:

  



  

(a)  A Participant who ceases to be an Employee, director or
Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate by reason of Disability may
exercise any Option granted to such Participant to the extent that the Option
has become exercisable but has not been exercised on the date of the
Participant's termination of service due to Disability; and in the event
rights to exercise the Option accrue periodically, to the extent of a pro
rata portion through the date of the Participant's termination of service
due to Disability of any additional vesting rights that would have accrued on
the next vesting date had the Participant not become Disabled. The proration
shall be based upon the number of days accrued in the current vesting period
prior to the date of the Participant's termination of service due to
Disability.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(b)  A Disabled Participant may exercise the Option only within
the period ending one year after the date of the Participant's termination of
service due to Disability, notwithstanding that the Participant might have
been able to exercise the Option as to some or all of the Shares on a later
date if the Participant had not been terminated due to Disability and had
continued to be an Employee, director or Consultant or, if earlier, within
the originally prescribed term of the Option.

  



  

(c)  The Administrator shall make the determination both of
whether Disability has occurred and the date of its occurrence (unless a
procedure for such determination is set forth in another agreement between the
Company and such Participant, in which case such procedure shall be used for
such determination). If requested, the Participant shall be examined by a
physician selected or approved by the Administrator, the cost of which
examination shall be paid for by the Company.

  



   | 17.| _EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF DEATH WHILE AN EMPLOYEE, DIRECTOR
OR CONSULTANT._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement:

  



  

(a)  In the event of the death of a Participant while the
Participant is an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an
Affiliate, such Option may be exercised by the Participant's Survivors to the
extent that the Option has become exercisable but has not been exercised on
the date of death; and in the event rights to exercise the Option accrue
periodically, to the extent of a pro rata portion through the date of death
of any additional vesting rights that would have accrued on the next vesting
date had the Participant not died. The proration shall be based upon the
number of days accrued in the current vesting period prior to the
Participant's date of death.

  



  

(b)  If the Participant's Survivors wish to exercise the Option,
they must take all necessary steps to exercise the Option within one year
after the date of death of such Participant, notwithstanding that the decedent
might have been able to exercise the Option as to some or all of the Shares
on a later date if he or she had not died and had continued to be an Employee,
director or Consultant or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term
of the Option.

  



   | 18.| _EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE ON UNACCEPTED STOCK
GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event of a termination of service (whether as an Employee, director or
Consultant) with the Company or an Affiliate for any reason before the
Participant has accepted a Stock Grant or a Stock-Based Award and paid the
purchase price, if required, such grant shall terminate.

  



  

For purposes of this Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 below, a Participant to
whom a Stock Grant or a Stock-Based Award has been issued under the Plan who
is absent from work with the Company or with an Affiliate because of temporary
disability (any disability other than a Disability as defined in Paragraph 1
hereof), or who is on leave of absence for any purpose, shall not, during the
period of any such absence, be deemed, by virtue of such absence alone, to
have terminated such Participant's employment, director status or
consultancy with the Company or with an Affiliate, except as the
Administrator may otherwise expressly provide.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

In addition, for purposes of this Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 below, any
change of employment or other service within or among the Company and any
Affiliates shall not be treated as a termination of employment, director
status or consultancy so long as the Participant continues to be an Employee,
director or Consultant of the Company or any Affiliate.

  



   | 19.| _EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF
TERMINATION OF SERVICE OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, DEATh or DISABILITY._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, in the event of a
termination of service for any reason (whether as an Employee, director or
Consultant), other than termination for Cause, death or Disability for which
there are special rules in Paragraphs 20, 21, and 22 below, before all
forfeiture provisions or Company rights of repurchase shall have lapsed, then
the Company shall have the right to cancel or repurchase that number of
Shares subject to a Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award as to which the Company's
forfeiture or repurchase rights have not lapsed.

  



   | 20.| _EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF
TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR CAUSE._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, the following
rules apply if the Participant's service (whether as an Employee, director or
Consultant) with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated for Cause:

  



  

(a)  All Shares subject to any Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award
that remain subject to forfeiture provisions or as to which the Company shall
have a repurchase right shall be immediately forfeited to the Company as of
the time the Participant is notified his or her service is terminated for
Cause.

  



  

(b)  Cause is not limited to events which have occurred prior to
a Participant's termination of service, nor is it necessary that the
Administrator's finding of Cause occur prior to termination. If the
Administrator determines, subsequent to a Participant's termination of
service, that either prior or subsequent to the Participant's termination the
Participant engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause, then all Shares
subject to any Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award that remained subject to
forfeiture provisions or as to which the Company had a repurchase right on
the date of termination shall be immediately forfeited to the Company.

  



   | 21.| _EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF
TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR DISABILITY._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, the following
rules apply if a Participant ceases to be an Employee, director or
Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate by reason of Disability: to the
extent the forfeiture provisions or the Company's rights of repurchase have
not lapsed on the date of Disability, they shall be exercisable; provided,
however, that in the event such forfeiture provisions or rights of repurchase
lapse periodically, such provisions or rights shall lapse to the extent of a
pro rata portion of the Shares subject to such Stock Grant or Stock-Based
Award through the date of Disability as would have lapsed had the
Participant not become Disabled. The proration shall be based upon the number
of days accrued prior to the date of Disability.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

The Administrator shall make the determination both as to whether Disability
has occurred and the date of its occurrence (unless a procedure for such
determination is set forth in another agreement between the Company and such
Participant, in which case such procedure shall be used for
such determination). If requested, the Participant shall be examined by a
physician selected or approved by the Administrator, the cost of which
examination shall be paid for by the Company.

  



   | 22.| _EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF DEATH
WHILE AN EMPLOYEE, DIRECTOR OR CONSULTANT._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, the following
rules apply in the event of the death of a Participant while the
Participant is an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an
Affiliate: to the extent the forfeiture provisions or the Company's rights of
repurchase have not lapsed on the date of death, they shall be exercisable;
provided, however, that in the event such forfeiture provisions or rights of
repurchase lapse periodically, such provisions or rights shall lapse to the
extent of a pro rata portion of the Shares subject to such Stock Grant or
Stock-Based Award through the date of death as would have lapsed had the
Participant not died. The proration shall be based upon the number of days
accrued prior to the Participant's date of death.

  



  

(a)  At the discretion of the Administrator, the Company shall
have received an opinion of its counsel that the Shares may be issued in
compliance with the Securities Act without registration thereunder.

  



   | 23.| _DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all Options granted under
this Plan which as of such date shall not have been exercised and all Stock
Grants and Stock-Based Awards which have not been accepted, to the extent
required under the applicable Agreement, will terminate and become null and
void; provided, however, that if the rights of a Participant or a
Participant's Survivors have not otherwise terminated and expired, the
Participant or the Participant's Survivors will have the right immediately
prior to such dissolution or liquidation to exercise or accept any Stock
Right to the extent that the Stock Right is exercisable or subject to
acceptance as of the date immediately prior to such dissolution or
liquidation. Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any
outstanding Stock-Based Awards shall immediately terminate unless otherwise
determined by the Administrator or specifically provided in the applicable
Agreement.

  



   | 24.| _ADJUSTMENTS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, a Participant's rights
with respect to any Stock Right granted to such Participant hereunder shall
be adjusted as hereinafter provided, unless otherwise specifically provided in
a Participant's Agreement.

  



  

(a) _Changes with respect to Shares of Common Stock_.

  



  

(i) If (1) the shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or combined
into a greater or smaller number of shares or if the Company shall issue any
shares of Common Stock as a stock dividend on its outstanding Common Stock, or
(2) additional shares or new or different shares or other securities of the
Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with respect to such shares
of Common Stock, each Stock Right and the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable thereunder shall be appropriately increased or decreased
proportionately, and appropriate adjustments shall be made including, in the
exercise, base or purchase price per share and in the Performance Goals
applicable to outstanding Performance-Based Awards to reflect such events. The
number of Shares subject to the limitations in Paragraphs 3(a), 3(b), 3(d)
and 4(c) shall also be proportionately adjusted upon the occurrence of such
events.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(ii)  The Administrator may also make adjustments of the type described
in Paragraph 24(a) above to take into account distributions to stockholders
other than those provided for in Paragraphs 24(b) below, or any other event,
if the Administrator determines that adjustments are appropriate to avoid
distortion in the operation of the Plan or any Award, having due regard for
the qualification of ISOs under Section 422, the requirements of Section
409A, to the extent applicable.

  



  

(ii) References in the Plan to Shares will be construed to include any
stock or securities resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this
Paragraph 24(a).

  



  

(b) _Corporate Transactions_. If the Company is to be consolidated
with or acquired by another entity in a Corporate Transaction, the
Administrator or the board of directors of any entity assuming the
obligations of the Company hereunder (the "Successor Board"), may, as to
outstanding Options, take any of the following actions: (i) make appropriate
provision for the continuation of such Options by substituting on an
equitable basis for the Shares then subject to such Options either the
consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock
in connection with the Corporate Transaction or securities of any successor
or acquiring entity; or (ii) upon written notice to the Participants, provide
that such Options must be exercised (either (A) to the extent then
exercisable or (B) at the discretion of the Administrator, any such Options
being made partially or fully exercisable for purposes of this Subparagraph),
within a specified number of days of the date of such notice, at the end of
which period such Options which have not been exercised shall terminate; or
(iii) terminate such Options in exchange for payment of an amount equal to
the consideration payable upon consummation of such Corporate Transaction to a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Option would
have been exercisable (either (A) to the extent then exercisable or, (B) at
the discretion of the Administrator, any such Options being made partially or
fully exercisable for purposes of this Subparagraph) _less the aggregate_
 exercise price thereof. For purposes of determining the payments to be made
pursuant to Subclause (iii) above, in the case of a Corporate Transaction the
consideration for which, in whole or in part, is other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be valued at the fair value thereof as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the per share exercise price of an Option or portion thereof is
equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of one Share of Common
Stock, such Option may be cancelled with no payment due hereunder or
otherwise in respect thereof.

  



  

With respect to outstanding Stock Grants or Stock-Based Awards, the
Administrator or the Successor Board, shall make appropriate provision for the
continuation of such Stock Grants or Stock-Based Awards on the same terms and
conditions by substituting on an equitable basis for the Shares then subject
to such Stock Grants or Stock-Based Awards either the consideration payable
with respect to the outstanding Shares of Common Stock in connection with the
Corporate Transaction or securities of any successor or acquiring entity. In
lieu of the foregoing, in connection with any Corporate Transaction, the
Administrator may provide that each outstanding Stock Grant or Stock-
Based Award shall be terminated in exchange for payment of an amount equal to
the consideration payable upon consummation of such Corporate Transaction to
a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock comprising such Stock Grant
or Stock-Based Award (to the extent such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award is
no longer subject to any forfeiture or repurchase rights then in effect or, at
the discretion of the Administrator, all forfeiture and repurchase rights
being waived). For the avoidance of doubt, if the purchase or base price of a
Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award or portion thereof is equal to or greater
than the Fair Market Value of one Share of Common Stock, such Stock Grant or
Stock-Based Award, as applicable, may be cancelled with no payment due
hereunder or otherwise in respect thereof.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

In taking any of the actions permitted under this Paragraph 24(b), the
Administrator shall not be obligated by the Plan to treat all Stock Rights,
all Stock Rights held by a Participant, or all Stock Rights of the same type,
identically.

  



  

(c) _Recapitalization or Reorganization_. In the event of a
recapitalization or reorganization of the Company other than a Corporate
Transaction pursuant to which securities of the Company or of another
corporation are issued with respect to the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, a Participant upon exercising an Option or accepting a Stock Grant
after the recapitalization or reorganization shall be entitled to receive for
the price paid upon such exercise or acceptance if any, the number of
replacement securities which would have been received if such Option had been
exercised or Stock Grant accepted prior to such recapitalization or
reorganization.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments to Stock-Based Awards_. Upon the happening of any of
the events described in Subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) above, any
outstanding Stock-Based Award shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the
events described in such Subparagraphs. The Administrator or the Successor
Board shall determine the specific adjustments to be made under this Paragraph
24, including, but not limited to the effect of any, Corporate Transaction
and, subject to Paragraph 4, its determination shall be conclusive.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Awards upon Consummation of a Corporate
Transaction_. Except as the Administrator may otherwise determine, each
Stock Right will automatically terminate (and in the case of outstanding
Shares of restricted Common Stock, will automatically be
forfeited) immediately upon the consummation of a Corporate Transaction,
other than (i) any award that is assumed, continued or substituted pursuant
to Paragraph 24(b) above, and (ii) any cash award that by its terms, or as a
result of action taken by the Administrator, continues following the
consummation of the Corporate Transaction.

  



   | 25.| _ISSUANCES OF SECURITIES._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of
shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock
of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made
with respect to, the number or price of shares subject to Stock Rights.
Except as expressly provided herein, no adjustments shall be made for
dividends paid in cash or in property (including without limitation,
securities) of the Company prior to any issuance of Shares pursuant to a Stock
Right.

  



  

(b) The Company will not be obligated to issue any Shares pursuant to
the Plan or to remove any restriction from Shares previously issued under the
Plan until: (i) the Company is satisfied that all legal matters in connection
with the issuance of such Shares have been addressed and resolved; (ii) if
the outstanding Shares is at the time of issuance listed on any stock exchange
or national market system, the Shares to be issued have been listed or
authorized to be listed on such exchange or system upon official notice
of issuance; and (iii) all conditions of the award have been satisfied or
waived. The Company may require, as a condition to the exercise of an award
or the issuance of Shares under an award, such representations or agreements
as counsel for the Company may consider appropriate to avoid violation of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any applicable state or non-U.S.
securities law. Any Shares issued under the Plan will be evidenced in such
manner as the Administrator determines appropriate, including book-
entry registration or delivery of stock certificates. In the event that the
Administrator determines that stock certificates will be issued in connection
with Shares issued under the Plan, the Administrator may require that such
certificates bear an appropriate legend reflecting any restriction on
transfer applicable to such Stock, and the Company may hold the certificates
pending the lapse of the applicable restrictions.

  



  

   

16

 



    



   | 26.| _FRACTIONAL SHARES._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

No fractional shares shall be issued under the Plan and the person exercising
a Stock Right shall receive from the Company cash in lieu of such
fractional shares equal to the Fair Market Value thereof.

  



   | 27.| _WITHHOLDING._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event that any federal, state, or local income taxes, employment
taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act withholdings or other amounts
are required by applicable law or governmental regulation to be withheld from
the Participant's salary, wages or other remuneration in connection with the
issuance of a Stock Right or Shares under the Plan or for any other reason
required by law, the Company may withhold from the Participant's
compensation, if any, or may require that the Participant advance in cash to
the Company, or to any Affiliate of the Company which employs or employed the
Participant, the statutory minimum amount of such withholdings unless a
different withholding arrangement, including the use of shares of the
Company's Common Stock or a promissory note, is authorized by the
Administrator (and permitted by law). For purposes hereof, the fair market
value of the shares withheld for purposes of payroll withholding shall be
determined in the manner set forth under the definition of Fair Market Value
provided in Paragraph 1 above, as of the most recent practicable date. If the
Fair Market Value of the shares withheld is less than the amount of payroll
withholdings required, the Participant may be required to advance the
difference in cash to the Company or the Affiliate employer.

  



   | 28.| _TERMINATION OF THE PLAN._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Plan will terminate on [DATE], the date which is ten years from the
_earlier_ of the date of its adoption by the Board of Directors and the date
of its approval by the shareholders of the Company. The Plan may be terminated
at an earlier date by vote of the shareholders or the Board of Directors of
the Company; provided, however, that any such earlier termination shall not
affect any Agreements executed prior to the effective date of such
termination. Termination of the Plan shall not affect any Stock Rights
theretofore granted.

  



   | 29.| _AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN AND AGREEMENTS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Plan may be amended by the shareholders of the Company. The Plan may also
be amended by the Administrator; provided that any amendment approved by the
Administrator which the Administrator determines is of a scope that requires
shareholder approval shall be subject to obtaining such shareholder approval
including, without limitation, to the extent necessary to qualify any or all
outstanding Stock Rights granted under the Plan or Stock Rights to be granted
under the Plan for favorable federal income tax treatment as may be
afforded ISOs under Section 422 and to the extent necessary to qualify the
Shares issuable under the Plan for listing on any national
securities exchange or quotation in any national automated quotation system
of securities dealers. Any modification or amendment of the Plan shall not,
without the consent of a Participant, adversely affect his or her rights under
a Stock Right previously granted to such Participant, unless such amendment
is required by applicable law or necessary to preserve the economic value of
such Stock Right. With the consent of the Participant affected, the
Administrator may amend outstanding Agreements in a manner which may be
adverse to the Participant but which is not inconsistent with the Plan. In
the discretion of the Administrator, outstanding Agreements may be amended by
the Administrator in a manner which is not adverse to the Participant. Nothing
in this Paragraph 30 shall limit the Administrator's authority to take any
action permitted pursuant to Paragraph 24.

  



  

   

17

 



    



   | 30.| _EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Nothing in this Plan or any Agreement shall be deemed to prevent the Company
or an Affiliate from terminating the employment, consultancy or
director status of a Participant, nor to prevent a Participant from
terminating his or her own employment, consultancy or director status or to
give any Participant a right to be retained in employment or other service by
the Company or any Affiliate for any period of time.

  



   | 31.| _SECTION 409A AND SECTION 422._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Company intends that the Plan and any Awards granted hereunder be exempt
from or comply with Section 409A, to the extent applicable. The
Company intends that ISOs comply with Section 422, to the extent applicable.
Any ambiguities in the Plan or any Award shall be construed to effect the
intent as described in this Paragraph 31.

  



  

If a Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A (and as
applied according to procedures of the Company and its Affiliates) as of his
or her separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Plan or
pursuant to an Award constitutes non-exempt deferred compensation under
Section 409A that is being paid by reason of separation from service, no
payments due under this Plan or pursuant to an Award may be made until the
earlier of: (i) the first day of the seventh month following the
Participant's separation from service, or (ii) the Participant's date of
death; provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month
period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum, without interest, on the
first day of the seventh month following the Participant's separation from
service.

  



  

The Administrator shall administer the Plan with a view toward ensuring that
Awards under the Plan that are subject to Section 409A or Section 422,
as applicable, comply with the requirements thereof and that Options under
the Plan be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A or compliant with
Section 422, as applicable, but neither the Administrator nor any member of
the Board of Directors, nor the Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
other person acting hereunder on behalf of the Company, the Administrator or
the Board of Directors shall be liable to a Participant or any Survivor by
reason of the acceleration of any income, or the imposition of any
additional tax or penalty, with respect to any Award, whether by reason of a
failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A or Section 422 or
otherwise.

  



   | 32.| _INDEMNITY._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Neither the Board of Directors nor the Administrator, nor any members of
either, nor any employees of the Company or any parent, subsidiary, or
other Affiliate, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation,
construction or determination made in good faith in connection with their
responsibilities with respect to this Plan, and the Company hereby agrees to
indemnify the members of the Board or Directors, the members of the
Committee, and the employees of the Company and its parent or subsidiaries in
respect of any claim, loss, damage, or expense (including reasonable counsel
fees) arising from any such act, omission, interpretation, construction or
determination to the full extent permitted by law.

  



   | 33.| _CLAWBACK._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, the Company
may recover from a Participant any compensation received from any Stock
Right (whether or not settled) or cause a Participant to forfeit any Stock
Right (whether or not vested) in the event that the Company's Clawback Policy
as then in effect is triggered.

  



  

   

18

 



    



   | 34.| _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

By accepting or being deemed to have accepted an award under the Plan, each
Participant waives (or will be deemed to have waived), to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law, any right to a trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim concerning any rights under the Plan or any
award, or under any amendment, waiver, consent, instrument, document or other
agreement delivered or which in the future may be delivered in connection
therewith, and agrees (or will be deemed to have agreed) that any such action,
proceedings or counterclaim will be tried before a court and not before a
jury. By accepting or being deemed to have accepted an award under the Plan,
each Participant certifies that no officer, representative, or attorney of
the Company has represented, expressly or otherwise, that the Company would
not, in the event of any action, proceeding or counterclaim, seek to enforce
the foregoing waivers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan,
nothing herein is to be construed as limiting the ability of the Company and a
Participant to agree to submit any dispute arising under the terms of the
Plan or any ward to binding arbitration or as limiting the ability of
the Company to require any individual to agree to submit such disputes to
binding arbitration as a condition of receiving an award hereunder.

  



   | 35.| _UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Company's obligations under the Plan are unfunded, and no Participant
will have any right to specific assets of the Company in respect of any award
under the Plan. Participants will be general unsecured creditors of the
Company with respect to any amounts due or payable under the Plan.

  



   | 36.| _GOVERNING LAW._ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

This Plan shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the law of the
State of Delaware.
