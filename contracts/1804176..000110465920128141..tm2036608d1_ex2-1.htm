anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and owned by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, &ldquo;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&rdquo;) shall not be converted

Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, extinguished and cease to exist and (b) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws

the date of this Agreement, Longview has an amount in cash in the Trust Account equal to at least $ 414,317,682.00. The funds held
in the Trust Account are (a) invested in United States &ldquo;government securities&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16)
of the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations and (b)
held in trust pursuant to that certain Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of May 20, 2020 (the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-weight: normal"><U>Trust
Agreement</U></FONT>&rdquo;), between Longview and Continental, as trustee (the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-weight: normal"><U>Trustee</U></FONT>&rdquo;).
There are no separate agreements, side letters or other agreements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Longview SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect
or, to Longview&rsquo;s knowledge, that would entitle any Person to any portion of the funds in the Trust Account (other than (i)
in respect of deferred underwriting commissions or Taxes, (ii) the Pre-Closing Longview Holders who shall have elected to redeem
their Longview Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Governing Documents of Longview or (iii) if Longview fails to complete a business
combination within the allotted time period set forth in the Governing Documents of Longview and liquidates the Trust Account,
subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, Longview (in limited amounts to permit Longview to pay the expenses of the Trust Account&rsquo;s
liquidation, dissolution and winding up of Longview) and then the Pre-Closing Longview Holders). Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account are permitted to be released, except in the circumstances described in the Governing Documents
of Longview and the Trust Agreement. Longview has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date under,
and is not in material default or delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with the Trust

on the funds held in the Trust Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement). Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the distribution of assets from the Trust Account (A) in respect of deferred underwriting commissions or Taxes
or (B) to the Pre-Closing Longview Holders who have elected to redeem their Longview Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Governing
Documents of Longview, each in accordance with the terms of and as set forth in the Trust Agreement, Longview shall have no further
obligation under either the Trust Agreement or the Governing Documents of Longview to liquidate or distribute any assets held in

or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner with
respect to shares of stock of the Corporation, (5) any other information relating to such stockholder and such beneficial owner
that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations

by the written consent of the proposed nominee to serve as a director if elected and to being named in the Corporation&rsquo;s
proxy statement and associated proxy card as a nominee of the stockholder. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to

proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation or whether such nominee would be independent under applicable Securities
and Exchange Commission and stock exchange rules and the Corporation&rsquo;s publicly disclosed corporate governance guidelines,
as applicable. A stockholder shall not have complied with this <U>Section 1.10(B)</U> if the stockholder (or beneficial owner,
if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made) solicits or does not solicit, as the case may be, proxies or votes in support of
such stockholder&rsquo;s nominee in contravention of the representations with respect thereto required by this <U>Section 1.10</U>.</P>

that the Company reasonably expects all conditions of the Transaction Closing to be satisfied or waived on a date specified in
the notice (the &ldquo;<U>Scheduled Closing Date</U>&rdquo;) that is not less than five (5) business days from the date on which
the Closing Notice is delivered to the Subscriber, which Closing Notice shall contain the Company&rsquo;s wire instructions for
an escrow account (the &ldquo;<U>Escrow Account</U>&rdquo;) established by the Company with a third party escrow agent (the &ldquo;<U>Escrow
Agent</U>&rdquo;) to be identified in the Closing Notice (or such other account as agreed by the Company and the Subscriber). Subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Section 2 and Section 3, Subscriber shall deliver to the Company,
on or prior to the Scheduled Closing Date, the Purchase Price for the Shares by wire transfer of United States dollars in immediately
available funds (i) to the Escrow Account or (ii) to an account specified by the Company otherwise mutually agreed by the Subscriber
and the Company (&ldquo;<U>Alternative Settlement Procedures</U>&rdquo;). On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Subscriber
(1) the Shares in book entry (or if requested by the Subscriber in writing at a reasonable time in advance of the Closing, certificated)
form, free and clear of any liens or other restrictions whatsoever (other than those arising under state or federal securities
laws), in the name of Subscriber (or its nominee in accordance with its delivery instructions) or to a custodian designated by
Subscriber, as applicable, and (2) a copy of the records of the transfer agent of the Company showing Subscriber as the owner of
the Shares on and as of the Closing Date (the &ldquo;<U>Subscriber&rsquo;s Deliveries</U>&rdquo;). Unless otherwise provided pursuant
to Alternative Settlement Procedures, upon transfer of the Subscriber&rsquo;s Deliveries by the Company to Subscriber (or its nominee
in accordance with its delivery instructions), the Escrow Agent shall release the Purchase Price from the Escrow Account to the
Company. If this Subscription Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing and any funds have already been sent by the Subscriber
to the Escrow Account, then promptly after such termination, the Company will instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly return such
funds to the Subscriber. If the Transaction Closing does not occur within two (2) business days of the Scheduled Closing Date,
unless otherwise instructed by the Company and the Subscriber, the Escrow Agent or the Company, as applicable, shall promptly (but
not later than one (1) business day thereafter) return the Purchase Price to Subscriber by wire transfer of U.S. dollars in immediately
available funds to the account specified by Subscriber, and any book entries or share certificates shall be deemed cancelled and
any share certificates shall be promptly (but not later than one (1) business day thereafter) returned to the Company.</P>

<U>4.1.2</U> and <U>4.1.3</U> above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection
with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this <U>subsection 4.1.5</U> were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this <U>subsection 4.1.5</U>. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this <U>subsection 4.1.5</U>
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>
