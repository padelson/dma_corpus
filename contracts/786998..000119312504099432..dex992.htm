WHEREAS, concurrently with the consummation of the Merger, MatrixOne, the
Representative, the Noteholders and the stockholders of Synchronicity who
shall become stockholders of MatrixOne as a result thereof shall enter into a

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Subtwo shall merge with and into
Synchronicity in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), and the separate corporate existence of Subtwo shall
thereupon cease and Synchronicity shall continue as the Surviving Corporation.
Synchronicity, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."



Section 1.2 _Consummation of the Merger_. In order to effectuate the Merger,
on the Closing Date, Synchronicity shall cause a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") to be filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware,
in such form __  

  as required by, and executed in accordance with, the DGCL. The Merger shall
be effective as of the time of filing of the Certificate of Merger
(the "Effective Time"). __



Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
provided for in Section 259 of the DGCL.



Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At
and after the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Subtwo, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Subtwo Certificate of
Incorporation"), shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until amended in accordance with the DGCL, except that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be Synchronicity Software, Inc.



Section 1.5 _By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation_. At and after the
Effective Time, the By-laws of Subtwo (the "Subtwo By-laws"), as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation, until amended in accordance with the DGCL.

 



Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be determined by
MatrixOne, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.7 _Closing_. Subject to Section 10.1, the closing of the Merger

by MatrixOne and Synchronicity; _provided_ , _however_ , that MatrixOne may
by notice to Synchronicity extend the Closing for up to 5 business days from

in the good faith judgment of MatrixOnes general counsel that the issuance
of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of MatrixOne ("MatrixOne

confidential. The date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to herein

amount  



 

7  into which the Common Shares or Series A Shares represented by such Cashed-

Certificate surrenders such Synchronicity Note or Converted Certificate,
provided that there shall be paid to the record holder of the MatrixOne Common
Stock Certificate issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the
time such holder receives such MatrixOne Common Stock Certificate, the amount

Agreement, no certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of
MatrixOne Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of any
Synchronicity Notes or Converted Certificates, no dividend or other
distribution with respect to MatrixOne Common Stock shall relate to any
fractional shares of MatrixOne Common Stock and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of MatrixOne. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder
of Synchronicity Notes or Converted Certificates exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of MatrixOne Common Stock (after taking into account all MatrixOne Common
Stock  



 

8  Certificates delivered by such holder) shall be paid an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to such fractional part of a share of MatrixOne Common
Stock multiplied by the Per Merger Share Value.

(f) _Lost Synchronicity Notes and Cashed-Out or Converted Certificates_. If
any Synchronicity Note, Cashed-Out Certificate or Converted Certificate shall

or Converted Certificate shares of MatrixOne Common Stock as determined under

or Converted Certificate. When authorizing such payment or issuance the Board
of Directors of the Surviving Corporation (or any authorized officer thereof)
may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent thereto,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Synchronicity Note,
Cashed-Out Certificate or Converted Certificate to agree to indemnify the
Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Synchronicity Note, Cashed-Out Certificate or

of Synchronicity are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or exchanged pursuant to
this Section 2.3.

thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such

withdrawn such demand or otherwise have forfeited  



 

9  appraisal rights (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or (e). Such Synchronicity
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Synchronicity stockholders who
shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such shares converted pursuant to Section 2.2(c)
or (e). 

---|--- 



(b) Synchronicity shall give MatrixOne (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by Synchronicity, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Synchronicity
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Synchronicity shall not,
except with the prior written consent of MatrixOne, make any payment with

subject of such previously asserted claim, and the indemnification obligation
of Synchronicity, the Noteholders, the Stockholders or MatrixOne with respect
thereto, shall survive until such time that such claim is resolved in

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by the Noteholders and Stockholders_ .



(a) The Noteholders and Stockholders shall indemnify MatrixOne and the
Surviving Corporation against and hold them harmless from any loss, liability,

and consultants fees) (any of the foregoing are referred to herein
individually as a "Loss" and collectively, as "Losses") suffered or incurred
by any such indemnified person for or on account of or arising from or in
connection with (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Synchronicity in Article III, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
Synchronicity in this Agreement or (iii) any misstatement or omission in the

(b) The Noteholders and Stockholders shall have no obligation under Section

thereafter, subject to the next sentence in this Section 8.2(b), the
obligation of the Noteholders and Stockholders under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall

the indemnified persons thereunder. The obligation of the Noteholders and

representation and warranty in Section 3.2. The obligations of the

39  Shares Percentage. The foregoing limitations in this Section 8.2(b) shall
not apply to knowing and intentional or fraudulent breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement ;
provided, however, that any obligation of a Noteholder or Stockholder for any
such knowing and intentional or fraudulent breaches by Synchronicity shall be
limited to the Merger consideration received by such Noteholder or
Stockholder and shall be several, and not joint.



Section 8.3 _Indemnification by the Noteholders and Signing Stockholders_.
Each Noteholder and Signing Stockholder, severally and not jointly, shall
indemnify MatrixOne and the Surviving Corporation against and hold them

any representation or warranty of it in Article IV or (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of it in this Agreement.



Section 8.4  _Indemnification by MatrixOne_.



(a) MatrixOne shall indemnify the Noteholders and Stockholders and hold them

of any covenant or agreement of MatrixOne in this Agreement.



(b) MatrixOne shall have no obligation under Section 8.4(a)(i) until the

(a) An indemnified person under Sections 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give prompt written notice to an indemnifying party (the
"Indemnifying Party") of any Loss in respect of which such Indemnifying Party
has a duty to indemnify such Indemnified Party under Sections 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4
(a "Claim"), specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the Loss for which
indemnification is sought, the section or sections of this Agreement or the
PEandE Agreement to which the Claim relates and the amount of the Loss involved
(or, if not then determinable, a reasonable good faith estimate of the amount
of the Loss involved), except that any delay or failure so to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall only relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by
reason of such delay or failure. Any such notice to be given to an
Indemnifying Party under Section 8.2 or 8.3 or by an Indemnified Party under
Section 8.4 shall be given to or by the Representative.



 

40 (b) If a Claim results from any claim, suit, action or cause of action brought
or asserted by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party
shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all
expenses. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in such Third Party Claim and participate in such defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim within 10 days after notice thereof, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of such Third Party Claim for the account of the Indemnifying Party, subject
to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at
any time prior to the compromise, settlement or final determination thereof.
Anything in this Section 8.5 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent, settle
or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim which would have an adverse
effect on the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party may, without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent, compromise or settle any such Third
Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any Third
Party Claim which requires solely money damages paid by the Indemnifying
Party, and which includes as an unconditional term thereof the release by the
claimant or the plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim.



(c) With respect to any Claim other than a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall have 20 days from receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of
such Claim within which to respond thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does
not respond within such 20-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
to have accepted responsibility to make payment and shall have no further
right to contest the validity of such Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party within such 20-day period that it
rejects such Claim in whole or in part, the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party under
applicable law.



Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Effective Time,
the indemnification rights provided in this Agreement shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the parties hereto with respect to any breach of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties in
this Agreement; provided however, that the limitation in this Section 8.6
shall not apply to any knowing and intentional or fraudulent breaches of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties in this
Agreement.
