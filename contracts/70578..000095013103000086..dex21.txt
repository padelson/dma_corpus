Financial Certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 7.17. If
the Estimated Net Receivables Amount plus the Estimated Inventory Value (the
"Estimated Working Capital Amount") is less than $450 million, then Buyer

Amount and the Inventory Value (together, the "Closing Date Items"), as of

Statements. After the Closing Date, at Buyer\'s request, the Company and each
of the other Sellers shall assist Buyer and its Representatives in the
preparation of the Statement and shall provide Buyer and its Representatives
any information reasonably requested and shall further provide them with
access at all reasonable times during regular business hours and

notifies Buyer in writing within 30 days after Buyer\'s delivery of the
Statement of any objection to any component of the computation of the Closing
Items set forth therein (the "Objection Notice"), such computation shall be
final and binding. The Objection Notice shall specify the amount of and the
basis for the objections set forth therein. The Objection Notice shall
include only objections based on (i) mathematical errors in computation of
the Closing Date Items, or (ii) Closing Date Items not having been prepared

methods that were used to prepare the Company Financial Statements. If Buyer

shall be resolved by an independent nationally recognized accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Company (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"). The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be made as
promptly as practicable, and in no event later than 75 days after delivery of
the Statement, and shall be final and binding on the parties, absent manifest
error, which error may only be corrected by such Independent Accounting Firm.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid one-
half by Buyer and one-half by the Company.   (e) If the aggregate amount of
Accounts Receivable included in the Acquired Assets minus (i) the aggregate
amount of Accounts Payable included in the Assumed Liabilities and (ii) the
Company Reserves (the "Net Receivables Amount"), plus the Inventory Value
(the "Working Capital Amount") is less than $450 million then the Purchase
Price shall be decreased by the amount of the shortfall (the "Working Capital
Adjustment"). Any Working Capital Adjustment resulting from this Section
3.4(e) shall be offset by any reduction to the Purchase Price made at the
Closing based on the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment.   (f) The amount
of the Working Capital Adjustment shall be paid on the Adjustment Payment
Date. The "Adjustment Payment Date" shall be the date that is 35 days

Buyer and each Seller shall agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price
and the Assumed Liabilities among the Acquired Assets (the "Allocation") for
all income Tax purposes. The Allocation shall be consistent with the Code and
based on an initial proposal by Buyer. Sellers will have the right to raise
reasonable objections to the Allocation within 15 days after Buyer\'s
delivery thereof, in which event Buyer and Sellers will negotiate in good
faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Sellers cannot resolve
such dispute within 15 days after Sellers notify Buyer of such objections,
such dispute with respect to the Allocation shall be presented to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which shall, within 30 days thereafter, render a
decision, which shall be final and binding upon each of the parties. The
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be shared in
equal amounts by Buyer and Sellers. Buyer and Sellers each shall report and
file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refunds)
consistent with the Allocation, and shall take no position contrary thereto
or inconsistent therewith (including in any audits or examinations by any Tax
Authority or any other Proceedings). Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in the
preparation of, and shall timely file, any forms (including Form 8594) with
respect to the Allocation, including any amendments to such forms required
with respect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price, pursuant to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the
foregoing agreement shall survive the Closing Date without limitation.  
3.6 Designation of Affiliates by Buyer. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
may designate one or more of its Subsidiaries to acquire at the Closing all
or part of the Acquired Assets, in which event all references to "Buyer"
shall be deemed to refer to each such Subsidiary with respect to the Acquired
Assets to be acquired by such Subsidiary; provided, however, that no
designation otherwise permitted by this Section 3.6 shall relieve Buyer from
any of its liabilities or obligations hereunder.   3.7 Section 338(h)(10)
Election. Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer\'s request to make an election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to treat the purchase and sale of any

Closing, Buyer may designate one or more Persons as a "qualified
intermediary" within the meaning of Internal Revenue Service Regulation

to acquire at the Closing all or part of Buyer\'s rights to this Agreement or
the Acquired Assets in order to effectuate a like-kind exchange under Section
1031 of the Code. Buyer\'s Liabilities under this Agreement shall be no
greater, and no less, than such Liabilities would have been had the Buyer or
its Subsidiaries directly acquired the Acquired Assets.   21    
Article 4  INDEMNITY ESCROW   4.1 Creation of Escrow. At the Closing, as
collateral security for the payment of any indemnification obligations of

authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each Seller,
including by any action or required approval of the equityholder or

the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other formation documents of such
Seller, (ii) any mortgage, indenture, lease, Contract, or other agreement to
which any Seller is a party or by which any of any Seller\'s assets or

Business. As of the Agreement Date, no Seller has Knowledge of
any infringement or unauthorized use by any Person of any material

the Bankruptcy Court Approval shall be appealed, Sellers shall use all
reasonable efforts to defend such appeal.   7.3 Notification of Certain

the prior consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, have the right to contact and negotiate directly with
Seller\'s joint venturers and other partners, parties to the Assumed

Liabilities. The Company shall have the right to participate in
such negotiations and agrees to cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer\'s request, in
any such negotiations. It is acknowledged and understood that no

pursuant to Section 7.4(b)(ii) or Section 7.4(b)(iii), shall be conducted in

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or other public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither
Buyer nor any Seller shall issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior approval of the other party, in each case
except as may be required by Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Buyer and each
Seller shall cause its Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to

Court providing for the assumption and assignment of the Assumed

Transfer Taxes arising out of the transfer of the Assets and any Transfer
Taxes required to effect any recording or filing with respect thereto shall
be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. The Transfer Taxes shall

unless otherwise indicated in the Bankruptcy Court Approval or, at Closing,
Sellers or Buyer, as appropriate, provides an appropriate resale exemption
certificate or other evidence acceptable to Buyer or Seller, as appropriate,

bill, statement or other charge with respect thereto. If such charges or
rates are assessed either based upon time or for a specified period, such
charges or rates shall be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date. If
such charges or rates are assessed based upon usage of utility or similar
services, such charges shall be prorated based upon meter readings taken on
the Closing Date.   (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
amounts due pursuant to the terms of the Assumed Contracts, other than those
Contracts set forth on Schedule 3.4(a)   37    attached hereto, for any

Support Arrangements for which Buyer is not required to enter into
replacement credit support arrangements in accordance with the immediately

which case such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct
as of such date; provided, however, that the failure of any such
representations or warranties to be true and correct on and as of the Closing

transactions contemplated hereby unless such failure, either individually or
in the aggregate, has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a Material Adverse Effect; provided, further, that for the purposes of
this Section 8.1(a), all references to materiality in Article 5 shall be

and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the

either Buyer or the Company:   (i) if the Closing shall not have occurred on

however, that the terminating party is not in material and willful breach of
any of its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and has
not failed in any material respect to perform any of its obligations
hereunder; or   (ii) if there shall be any Law or regulation that

permanently restraining, prohibiting or enjoining Buyer or the Company from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby is entered and such
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall become final;   (c) by
Buyer:   (i) if there shall have been a breach by any Seller of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or
more of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1, and such breach shall be
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured within 15 days after written Notice thereof shall have been received by
the Company; or   (ii) if (A) the Bankruptcy Court has not approved the

specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and of no
further force and effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby  
45    shall be abandoned without further action of the parties hereto;
provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any party hereto
of any Liability for willful breach of this Agreement; provided further, that
in connection with any such termination each party shall be and shall remain
liable for any payments owed or that become owed pursuant to, or that arise
as a result of any such termination pursuant to, Section 7.2(b) hereof or the

INDEMNIFICATION   10.1 Indemnification of Buyer. Subject to the time and
other limitations in Articles 4 and 10, Sellers, jointly and severally,
covenant and agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its officers,
directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (the "Buyer Indemnitees") from
and against, and pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all
Liabilities, losses, claims, damages, punitive damages, causes of action,
lawsuits, administrative proceedings (including informal proceedings),
investigations, audits, demands, assessments, adjustments, judgments,
settlement payments, deficiencies, penalties, fines, interest (including
interest from the date of such damages) and costs and expenses (including
without limitation reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements of every
kind, nature and description) (collectively, "Losses") resulting from or
arising out of:   (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made
by any Seller herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement;   (b) any failure of any Seller to perform any covenant or
agreement hereunder or to fulfill any other obligation in respect hereof;
and   (c) any Excluded Assets or any Excluded Liabilities, including
fines, penalties and claims by any Person for damages or monetary relief to
the extent such fines, penalties or claims are with respect to pre-Closing
periods and relate to facts, events or circumstances arising or occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date. The foregoing indemnification by Sellers shall
not extend to or include Liabilities for investigation, remediation,
restoration, including restoration of injuries to natural resources, response
or RCRA corrective action with respect to the matters set forth on Schedule
10.1(c).   Sellers\' obligations under this Article 10 shall not be affected
or reduced by any knowledge of Buyer at or prior to the Closing of any breach
by any Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
regardless of whether Buyer gave written Notice thereof to Seller, or vice
versa, and regardless of whether Buyer elected to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby despite such knowledge.   10.2 Indemnification of
Sellers. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller, its
officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse the Seller Indemnitees
for, any and all Losses resulting from or arising out of:   46     (a)
the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer herein or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;   (b) any failure of
Buyer to perform any covenant or agreement made or contained in this
Agreement or to fulfill any other obligation in respect hereof;   (c) the
Assumed Liabilities; and   (d) Liabilities with respect to, arising out of
or relating to, the ownership, possession or use of the Acquired Assets and
the operation of the Business on or after the Closing Date.   10.3
Indemnification Procedures.   (a) In order for a Buyer Indemnitee or a
Seller Indemnitee (an "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim or demand made by any person or entity against the
Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify
the parties obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1 or
10.2 hereof (each, an "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in reasonable
detail, of the Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of written Notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
failure to give any Notice or make any deliveries required under this Article
10 shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result
of such failure. Such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such
claim and, if estimable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after the Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.   (b) The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend and settle, at its own expense and by
its own counsel (provided that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by
the Indemnified Party), any Third Party Claim; provided that, and for so long
as, the Indemnifying Party pursues the same in good faith and diligently and
provided that the Third Party Claim does not relate to an actual or potential
Loss to which Section 10.3(e) applies in which the Indemnified Party is
Buyer. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend or settle, it shall
promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in the defense thereof and in any settlement thereof. Such cooperation shall
include, but shall not be limited to, furnishing the Indemnifying Party with
any books, records or information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party that are in the Indemnified Party\'s possession or control and making
employees of the Indemnified Party available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in any matter through counsel of its own choosing at
its own expense (unless there is a conflict of interest that prevents counsel
for the Indemnifying Party from representing the Indemnified Party, in which
case the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for the
reasonable expenses of its counsel). After the Indemnifying Party
has notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to  
47    undertake to defend or settle any such asserted liability, and for
so long as the Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any additional legal expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any defense or
settlement of such asserted liability, except to the extent such
participation is requested by the Indemnifying Party, in which event the
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for
reasonable additional legal expenses and out-of-pocket expenses, and except
in the case of a Third Party Claim relating to an actual or potential Loss to
which Section 10.3(e) applies in which Buyer is the Indemnified Party.  
(c) No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to
entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or
claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential
party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
(i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all
Liability arising out of such action or claim, (ii) does not include a
statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act
by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party, and (iii) does not include any
injunctive or non-monetary relief.   (d) If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party may
defend against such Third Party Claim in such manner as it reasonably deems
appropriate at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.   (e) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article 10, if at any time, in the
reasonable opinion of Buyer as the Indemnified Party (notice of which opinion
shall be given in writing to the Indemnifying Party), any Third Party Claim
seeks material, prospective, non-monetary relief against Buyer, its operation
of the Business or its use or operation of the Acquired Assets, then such
Indemnified Party shall have the right to control or assume (as the case may
be) the defense of any such Third Party Claim and the amount of any
judgment or settlement and the reasonable costs and expenses of defense
(including, but not limited to, fees and disbursements of counsel and
experts) shall be included as part of the indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnified Party elects to exercise
such right, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party.   (f) Notice given by Buyer to the
Company shall constitute valid Notice to all Seller Indemnitees, and with
respect to any Third Party Claim with respect to which more than one Seller
Indemnitee is an indemnified party or a potential indemnified party, all such
Seller Indemnitees shall select a single Seller Indemnitee to act as
representative for all such Seller Indemnitees with respect to such Third
Party Claim, and (i) such representative shall be authorized to make
authorizations and consents on behalf of each such Seller Indemnitee, and
(ii) Buyer shall, with respect to all matters relating to such Third Party
Claim, be entitled to rely on the statements, authorizations and consents of
such representative as being the statement, authorization or consent of each
such Seller Indemnitee.   (g) In the event an Indemnified Party has
indemnification claim against any Indemnifying Party under the Agreement that
does not involve a Third Party Claim being   48    asserted against or
sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver Notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such failure.
Such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such claim, and, if
estimable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim
described in such Notice or does not respond to such claim within 60 days of
receipt thereof, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Notice
will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party
on demand following the final determination thereof. In the event of any
dispute of a claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through negotiations within a period of thirty (30) days, such
dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction.   10.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive for a
period of 12 months from the Closing Date and shall not be extinguished by
the Closing or any investigation made by or on behalf of any party
hereto.   10.5 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless any party pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 shall
terminate on the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date (the
"Indemnity Termination Date"). If, prior to the Indemnity Termination Date,
an Indemnified Party shall have given notice to the Indemnifying Party of a
claim for indemnification then the right to indemnification with respect to
such claim shall remain in effect without regard to when such matter shall
have been finally determined.   10.6 Limitations on Indemnification. The
indemnification provided for in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 shall be subject to
the following limitations:   (a) Sellers shall not be obligated to pay any
amounts for indemnification under Section 10.1(a) until the aggregate
indemnification payments equal $1.25 million (the "Basket Amount"), whereupon
Sellers shall be obligated to pay all amounts in excess of the Basket Amount
up to the Indemnity Escrow. Sellers shall be obligated to pay any amounts for
indemnification under Sections 10.1(b) and 10.1(c) from the first dollar of
Loss in full up to the Indemnity Escrow. Buyer shall not be obligated to pay
any amounts for indemnification under Section 10.2(a) until the aggregate
indemnification payments equal the Basket Amount, whereupon Buyer shall be
obligated to pay all amounts in excess of the Basket Amount up to $25
million. Buyer shall be obligated to pay any amounts for indemnification
under Sections 10.2(b) and 10.2(c) from the first dollar of Loss in full up
to $25 million.   (b) The Indemnity Escrow (as such may be reduced from time
to time by disbursements in accordance with Section 4.2 herein) shall be the
Buyer Indemnitees\' sole and exclusive recourse for the satisfaction of
any indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to Section 10.1 and in no
event shall Sellers\' indemnification obligations in the aggregate exceed the
amount of the Indemnity Escrow. In no event shall Buyer\'s indemnification
obligations under this Agreement exceed $25 million.   49     (c) The
indemnification provided for in this Article 10 shall be the exclusive right
and remedy with respect to any claim or cause of action based upon, relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or otherwise in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether such claim or cause of
action arises out of any contract, tort or otherwise and no such claim or
cause of action shall be enforceable unless made in accordance with the
procedures, and within the time periods, set forth in this Article 10.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, either party shall be entitled to any
additional remedies that may be available under law or equity for a breach of
a representation or warranty to the extent such party can demonstrate fraud
or willful or knowing misrepresentation by the other party in a non-
appealable final action before a court of competent jurisdiction.   (d) (i)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers shall be
obligated for Losses in respect of Liabilities and obligations arising under
any Environmental Law under this Article 10 only to the extent that:   (x)
investigation and/or remediation of any Hazardous  Substance is required
under an applicable Environmental Law or by  a Governmental Entity or
pursuant to a claim brought by any third  party;   (y) the remediation
standards selected under the applicable  Environmental Law are cost-effective
and reasonable under the  circumstances; and   (z) the methods selected for
conducting the investigation  and/or remediation are cost-effective and
reasonable under the  circumstances.   (ii) If any claim arising under this
Article 10 involves contamination that occurred both before and after the
Closing Date, the cost of remediation shall be allocated between Buyer and
Sellers in proportion to each party\'s contribution to the contamination to
the extent such contribution can be determined and otherwise in proportion to
the period of time each party has owned or had an interest in the
property.   Article 11  MISCELLANEOUS   11.1 Expenses. Except as set
forth in this Agreement and whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, each party hereto shall bear all costs and expenses
incurred or to be incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. As between
Buyer and Sellers, Sellers shall bear all costs of any Persons (other than
Buyer, its agents or Affiliates), entitled to reimbursement by the Bankruptcy
Court.   11.2 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights
or obligations hereunder may be assigned by Sellers without the prior
written consent of Buyer, or by Buyer without the prior written consent of
Sellers, provided, that Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to one or more
wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Buyer, which assignment shall not relieve Buyer
of   50    its obligation hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.   11.3 Parties in
Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of Seller and Buyer, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the
foregoing, no direct or indirect holder of any equity interests or securities
of either Seller or Buyer (whether such holder is a limited or general
partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any Affiliate of either
Seller or Buyer, nor any Representative, or controlling Person of each of the
parties hereto and their respective Affiliates, shall have any liability or
obligation arising under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.   11.4 Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals

is dated as of January 9, 2003, by and among (i) National Steel Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), (ii) United States Steel Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (together with any designated subsidiaries, "Buyer"),
and (iii) J.P. Morgan Trust Company, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"). Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such
terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and
among the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company set forth on the signature
pages thereto and Buyer (the "Purchase Agreement").   WITNESSETH:  
WHEREAS, an escrow fund shall be established pursuant to Section 3.2 of
the Purchase Agreement at the time of execution of the Purchase Agreement,
which escrow fund shall be disbursed at the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of the Purchase Agreement; and   WHEREAS, simultaneously with
the execution hereof, Buyer shall deliver $6,500,000 (the "Deposit Fund") to
the Escrow Agent.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of
the covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:   1. Appointment of Escrow Agent. Buyer and the Company
hereby appoint and designate the Escrow Agent as escrow agent hereunder, and
the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent hereunder, to hold and
release the Deposit Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
Article 3 of the Purchase Agreement.   2. Escrow Deposit. On the date
hereof, there shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent on behalf of Buyer,
and upon such deposit the Escrow Agent shall acknowledge receipt of,
$6,500,000 in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The
Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit Fund and shall administer the same in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Article 3 of the Purchase
Agreement.   3. Release of Deposit Fund.   (a) Certain Definitions.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed
to such terms in the Purchase Agreement. In addition, the terms below shall
have the following respective meanings:   (i) "Notice of Disbursement" shall
mean a written notice that sets forth the provision of Section 9.1 of the
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which termination was    made and the date
of termination of the Purchase Agreement. The Notice of Disbursement shall
include a copy of the notice terminating the Purchase Agreement.   (ii)
"Notice of Non-Objection" shall mean a written notice from the Notified Party
that it does not object to a transfer of the assets comprising the Deposit
Fund.   (iii) "Notice of Objection" shall mean a written notice from
the Notified Party that it objects to a transfer of the assets comprising
the Deposit Fund.   (b) Disbursement. The Escrow Agent shall disburse the
Deposit Fund as follows:   (i) Closing. If the Closing under the Purchase
Agreement occurs, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit Fund to the
Company at the Closing. Buyer and the Company shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent written instructions (executed by each of Buyer and the Company),
setting forth the date and time of the Closing and authorizing the Escrow
Agent to deliver the Deposit Fund to the Company at the Closing.   (ii)
Termination of Purchase Agreement. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated by
either Buyer or the Company pursuant to any provision of Section 9.1 of the
Purchase Agreement, other than Section 9.1(d), the Escrow Agent shall deliver
the Deposit Fund to Buyer. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d), the Escrow Agent shall deliver the
Deposit Fund to the Company. Buyer and the Company shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent written instructions (executed by each of Buyer and the Company)
setting forth the date of the termination of the Purchase Agreement.   (c)
Procedure.   (i) Buyer shall be entitled to give Notice of Disbursement to
the Company (with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow Agent) at any time
after the termination of the Purchase Agreement by either Buyer or the
Company pursuant to any provision of Section 9.1 thereof, other than Section
9.1(d). The Company shall be entitled to give Notice of Disbursement to Buyer
(with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow Agent) at any time after the
termination of the Purchase Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(d) thereof. The party delivering the Notice of Disbursement is sometimes
referred to herein as the "Notifying Party." The party (Buyer or the Company)
to which the Notice of Disbursement is delivered is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Notified Party."   (ii) In the event that the Notified Party
gives Notice of Non-Objection to the Notifying Party, with contemporaneous
delivery to the Escrow Agent, or does not give Notice of Objection to the
Notice of Disbursement within 60 days of receipt thereof, then upon receipt
of such Notice of Non-Objection or at the end of such 60-day period, as
applicable, the Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver the Deposit Fund to the
Notifying Party.   (iii) In the event that the Notified Party gives Notice
of Objection within 60 days of receipt of the Notice of Disbursement, then
Buyer and the Company shall   2    endeavor to resolve the dispute.
Buyer and the Company shall act in good faith to attempt to reach a
resolution within 30 days following the date on which the Notified Party
gives Notice of Objection. If Buyer and the Company are able to agree on a
resolution, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both Buyer and the Company and shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
shall distribute the Deposit Fund in accordance with the terms of
the memorandum. If Buyer and the Company are unable to agree on any
resolution within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent shall not make any
transfers from the Deposit Fund except promptly pursuant to a final award
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be
timely taken. The Escrow Agent shall take the action specified in joint
notices signed by, and received from, Buyer and the Company as soon as
practical after its receipt thereof.   (iv) Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall release and distribute
the Deposit Fund pursuant to any joint written instructions executed by Buyer
and the Company or as directed by a final award determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be timely taken.   4. Fees
of Escrow Agent. Each of Buyer and the Company shall pay one-half of the
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Escrow Agent incurred by it
in connection with carrying out its duties hereunder.   5. Rights and Duties
of the Escrow Agent.   (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Escrow
Agent shall be determined solely by the provisions of this Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have and may exercise such powers
hereunder as are specifically delegated to the Escrow Agent by the terms
hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto,
including the power to hire attorneys to represent the Escrow Agent with
respect to matters arising from this Agreement and the power to file actions
as it deems necessary in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The Escrow
Agent shall have no implied duties and no obligation to take any action
hereunder except for any action specifically provided by this Agreement to be
taken by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or
obligation of any kind in connection with this Agreement or the Deposit Fund,
and shall not be required to deliver the same or any part thereof or take any
action with respect to any matters that might arise in connection therewith,
other than to receive, hold, and make delivery of the Deposit Fund as herein
provided or by reason of any order of a court of competent jurisdiction from
which no appeal may timely be taken. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to
any party for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith except to the
extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow
Agent\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of the provisions
of this Agreement was the primary cause of any loss to Buyer or the Company.
The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted
in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled person. In the event that the Escrow
Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall
receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its
opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be
entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be
to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed  
3    otherwise in writing by all of the parties hereto or by a final order
or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Buyer and the Company
hereby agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, hold harmless and defend
the Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents and employees
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including incidental expenses and reasonable legal fees and
expenses ("Escrow Agent Losses"), that may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them for following any
instructions or other directions upon which they are authorized to rely
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In addition to and not in limitation
of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer and the Company also agree,
jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each of them
harmless from and against any and all Escrow Agent Losses that may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees or any of them in
connection with or arising out of the Escrow Agent\'s performance under this
Agreement, provided the Indemnitees have not acted with gross negligence or
engaged in willful misconduct or breached the provisions of this Agreement.
The provisions of this Section 5(a) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent for any reason.
The Escrow Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder by or through
employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact.   (b) The Escrow Agent shall have
the right to resign after first having given Buyer and the Company notice in
writing of its intent to resign at least 30 days in advance. At the
expiration of such 30 days, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining
Deposit Fund to a successor Escrow Agent designated in writing by Buyer and
the Company. If Buyer and the Company fail to designate a successor to the
Escrow Agent within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent shall, at the
expense of Buyer and the Company, institute a bill of interpleader
as contemplated by Section 5(e)(ii) hereof. Any corporation or association
into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or
association resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any
corporation or association to which all or substantially all the corporate
trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be sold or
otherwise transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without
further act.   (c) If (i) the Deposit Fund is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any court order, or (ii) the payment,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be
stayed or enjoined by any court order, or (iii) any order, judgment or decree
shall be made or entered by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no
appeal may timely be taken affecting such property or any part thereof, then
in any of such events the Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion,
to rely upon and comply with any such order, judgment or decree which it is
advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, and if it
complies with any such order, judgment or decree it shall not be liable to
any of the parties hereto or to any other person, firm or corporation by
reason of such compliance, even though such order, judgment or decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.   (d) The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the accuracy, act in reliance
upon the contents and assume the genuineness of any instruction, direction,
request or   4    notice which is given to the Escrow Agent in proper
form pursuant to this Agreement and reasonably believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person, without the
necessity of the Escrow Agent verifying the truth or accuracy thereof. The
Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to investigate or in any way determine
whether Buyer or the Company is entitled to terminate the Purchase
Agreement.   (e) Should any controversy arise between or among Buyer and
the Company or any other person, firm or entity with respect to this
Agreement, the Deposit Fund or any part thereof, or the right of any party or
other person to receive the Deposit Fund, or should Buyer and the Company
fail to designate another Escrow Agent as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, or
if the Escrow Agent should be in doubt as to what action to take, the Escrow
Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to (i) withhold delivery
of the Deposit Fund until the controversy is resolved and/or (ii) institute a
bill of interpleader in any court of competent jurisdiction to determine the
rights of the parties hereto (the right of the Escrow Agent to institute such
bill of interpleader shall not, however, be deemed to modify the manner in
which Escrow Agent is entitled to make transfers from the Deposit Fund as
hereinabove set forth other than to tender the Deposit Fund into the
possession and control of such court).   (f) Buyer and the Company may, by
joint written direction, request the resignation of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall not be required to resign until its reasonable fees and
out-of-pocket expenses have been paid. Such direction shall also include the
designation of the successor Escrow Agent. Upon the turnover of the Deposit
Fund to the successor Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be released from
any further liability or responsibility in connection therewith other than
liability resulting from the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence, willful
misconduct or breach of the provisions of this Agreement.   6. Term. This
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the assets comprising
the Deposit Fund have been transferred in accordance with Section 3
hereof.   7. Escrow Earnings.   (a) Upon the disbursement of the Deposit
Fund, all income, proceeds, earnings or distributions on the Deposit Fund,
after payment of expenses or taxes incurred in connection therewith, shall be
paid to Buyer and the Company pro rata based on the amount of the Deposit
Fund disbursed to such parties pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however,
if the Closing under the Purchase Agreement occurs, all such income,
proceeds, earnings or distributions on the Deposit Fund, after payment of
expenses or taxes incurred in connection therewith, shall be paid to Buyer.
All such earnings, including any cash dividends, shall be reported by the
Escrow Agent to the recipients thereof in the calendar year in which such
earnings are paid.   (b) The Escrow Agent shall invest any cash in the
Deposit Fund at the written direction of both Buyer and the Company or in the
absence of such direction in the 100% U.S. Treasury Securities Money Market
Fund or any other mutual fund invested solely in United States Treasury
obligations for which the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow Agent
serves as investment manager, administrator, shareholder servicing agent, or
custodian or   5    subcustodian, notwithstanding that (i) the Escrow
Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow Agent receives fees from such funds for
services rendered, (ii) the Escrow Agent charges and collects fees for
services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, which fees are separate from
the fees received from such funds, and (iii) services performed for such
funds and pursuant to this Agreement may at times duplicate those provided to
such funds by the Escrow Agent or its affiliates. Until further written
notice, the Escrow Agent shall invest any cash in the Deposit Fund in the
100% U.S. Treasury Securities Money Market Fund. The Escrow Agent shall have
no liability for any loss sustained as a result of such investment, or any
investment made pursuant to the instructions of the parties hereto or as a
result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity.   8.
Miscellaneous.   (a) Time Periods. Whenever under the terms hereof the time
for giving a notice or performing an act falls upon a day other than a

Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies of any nature under or by reason of this Agreement,
except as expressly provided herein.   (l) Exclusive Jurisdiction. Without
limiting any party\'s right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy Court, (a)
the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the terms

Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (b) any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits and

persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may
be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow
Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of a party\'s authorized
representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back
to any one or more of such party\'s executive officers ("Executive
Officers"), which shall include the titles of Treasurer, Chief Financial and
Chief Executive Officer, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such Executive
Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency
Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone

bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or
similar identifying numbers provided by the Company or Buyer to identify (i)
the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary\'s bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank.
The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a
person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a
bank other than the beneficiary\'s bank or a designated intermediary bank.
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures are
commercially reasonable.   (n) TINSs. Upon execution of this Agreement, each
of Buyer and the Company shall provide the Escrow Agent with a fully executed
W-8 or W-9 IRS form, which shall include Buyer\'s and Company\'s Tax
Identification Number. In addition, all interest or other income earned under
the Agreement shall be allocated and/or paid as directed in a joint written
direction of Buyer and the Company and reported by the recipient to the
Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. Notwithstanding such
written directions, the Escrow Agent shall report and, as required, withhold
any taxes as it determines may be required by any law or regulation in effect
at the time of the distribution. In the absence of timely direction, all
proceeds of the Deposit Fund shall be retained in the Deposit Fund and
reinvested from time to time by the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 3. In
the event that any earnings remain undistributed at the end of any calendar
year, the Escrow Agent shall report to the Internal Revenue Service or such
other authority such earnings as it deems appropriate or as required by any
applicable law or regulation or, to the extent consistent therewith, as
directed in writing by Buyer and the Company. In addition, the Escrow Agent
shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate and shall remit such taxes to
the appropriate authorities.   [Remainder of Page Intentionally Left

Tenant a non-exclusive license to use, in common with the other Building
occupants, the common areas of the Building and the Land, including, but not
limited to, parking areas (subject to subsection (D) below) (collectively,
"Common Areas"), subject to, however, the rules and regulations attached
hereto as Exhibit "B."   (C) Without unreasonable interference with
Tenant\'s use of the Leased Premises, Landlord reserves the right to:   (1)
install, use, maintain, repair, and replace pipes, ducts, conduits, wires,

Building, above the ceiling surfaces, below the floor surfaces, within the
walls, and in the central core areas, and to relocate any pipes,
ducts, conduits, wires, and appurtenant meters and equipment included in the
Premises which are located in the Leased Premises or outside of the Leased

any other common facility.   (D) Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, Tenant and its employees and visitors shall have the non-exclusive
right to park on the Building\'s surface parking facilities in common with

the number of parking spaces that Tenant may use to the product of (1) the
number of parking spaces available for parking generally for occupants of the
Building and their employees and visitors, multiplied by (2) Tenant\'s
proportionate share, calculated based on the ratio that the number of square
feet of Leased Premises bears to the total number of square feet of the

its employees and visitors shall not park in any such assigned and/or
reserved spaces. Landlord reserves the right to close all or a portion of the

in writing.   Section 4 -- Holding Over.   (A) If, without the execution
of a new lease or written extension or written consent of Landlord, Tenant

agents shall not be liable to Tenant or to Tenant\'s employees, patrons,
visitors, invitees, or any other persons for any injury to any such persons

hazardous material (collectively, "Hazardous Materials") to be
used, generated, stored, or disposed of on, under, or about, or transported
to or from, the Premises (collectively, "Hazardous Materials Activities")
without first receiving Landlord\'s written consent, which may be withheld
for any reason and revoked at any time. If Landlord consents to any such
Hazardous Materials Activities, Tenant shall conduct them in strict
compliance (at Tenant\'s sole expense) with all applicable laws and
regulations, as hereinafter defined, and using all necessary and appropriate
precautions.   (B) Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any Hazardous
Materials Activities by Tenant, Tenant\'s employees, agents, contractors,

publications promulgated pursuant thereto (collectively "Hazardous Materials
Regulations"); provided, however, Hazardous Materials shall not include
products customarily used in the cleaning and operation of office space.

copy of any Hazardous Materials inventory statement(s) required by any
applicable hazardous Materials Regulation, all MSDS\'s and any update filed
in accordance with any applicable Hazardous Materials Regulation or
registration.   (D) If Tenant\'s activities violate or create a risk of
violation of any Hazardous Materials Regulation, Tenant shall cease such
activities immediately upon notice from Landlord. Tenant shall immediately
notify Landlord both by telephone and in writing of any spill or unauthorized

an "imminent hazard" under RCRA.   (E) Landlord and Landlord\'s
representatives and employees may enter the Premises at any time during the
term hereof to inspect Tenant\'s compliance with the provisions of this
Lease.   (F) The indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 10(A) and
10(B) shall continue after the termination of this Lease as to any matters
that occurred during or resulted from the term of this Lease.   Section 11
- Utilities; Services Provided by Landlord.   (A) Tenant shall pay Landlord,
as additional rent, Tenant\'s Pro Rata Share of the amounts payable by
Landlord for utilities (the "Utilities Expense") during the term of this
Lease. The Utilities Expense shall be payable as and when such amounts are
payable by Landlord to the provider of such utilities. Landlord shall,
promptly upon request by Tenant, furnish Tenant with copies of the utilities
statements received by Landlord. Landlord shall pay for those services
identified on Exhibit "C" attached hereto and incorporated herein and Tenant
shall pay Tenant\'s Pro Rata Share of such services, as additional rent, in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5(C) hereof. Tenant shall pay
all charges for any other services used in or about or supplied to the
Leased Premises, and shall indemnify Landlord against any liability on such
account.   (B) Landlord or Landlord\'s agent may not interrupt or cause
the interruption of utility service to the Leased Premises or the Common
Areas unless interruption results from bona fide repairs, construction, or
an emergency. If any such utility services are interrupted and continue to
be interrupted despite the good faith efforts of Landlord to remedy same,
Landlord shall not be liable in any respect for damages to the person or
property of Tenant or Tenant\'s employees, agents, or guests, and same shall
not be construed as grounds for constructive eviction or abatement of rent;
provided, however, in the event such interruption continues for more than ten
(10) consecutive days and renders the Leased Premises uninhabitable or
unusable by Tenant,   7    Tenant shall have the right to terminate the
Lease. Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to repair and remedy such
interruption promptly.   (C) The payment obligations set forth in this
Section 11 shall continue after the termination of this Lease as to any
matters that occurred during or resulted from the term of this Lease.  
Section 12 -- Condition of Premises; Improvements, Maintenance,
and Repairs.   (A) Tenant has examined and accepts the Leased Premises in
its present "AS IS" condition as suitable for the purposes for which the same

reimburse Landlord for any repairs occasioned by the willful misconduct or
negligence of Tenant, its employees, subtenants, licensees, or
concessionaires. Tenant agrees to give Landlord written notice of needed
repairs of which Tenant is aware. Landlord shall make such repairs within a
reasonable time. Tenant shall notify Landlord immediately of any emergency
repairs of which Tenant is aware. Tenant shall keep the Leased Premises in
good clean condition and shall, at its sole cost and expense, make all needed
repairs and replacements thereof, except for repairs and replacements
required to be made by Landlord under this Section 12. If any repairs
required to be made by Tenant hereunder are not made within ten (10) days
after written notice delivered to Tenant by Landlord, Landlord may at its
option make such repairs without liability to Tenant for any loss or
damage which may result by reason of such repairs, except to the extent such
loss or damage arises or results from the negligence or willful misconduct of
Landlord or its employees or agents, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon
demand as additional rent hereunder the cost of such repairs plus interest
thereon at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum from the date of such
payment by Landlord until repaid by Tenant. At the termination of this Lease,
Tenant shall deliver the Leased Premises in good order and condition, normal
wear and tear excepted. Normal wear and tear means deterioration which occurs
without negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse.   (C) Tenant shall
make no alterations, decorations, additions, or improvements in or to the
Leased Premises without Landlord\'s prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and then only by contractors or mechanics approved in
writing by Landlord. Tenant agrees that there shall be no construction of
partitions or other obstructions which might interfere with Landlord\'s free
access to mechanical installations or service facilities of the Building or
with moving of Landlord\'s equipment to or from the enclosures containing
said installations or facilities. All such work shall be done at such times
and in such manner as Landlord may from time to time designate.
Tenant covenants and agrees that all work done   8    by Tenant shall
be performed in full compliance with all laws, rules, orders, ordinances,
directions, regulations, and requirements of all governmental agencies having
jurisdiction. Before commencing any work approved by Landlord, Tenant shall
give Landlord at least five (5) days written notice of the
proposed commencement of such work and shall, if required by Landlord, secure
at Tenant\'s own cost and expense, a completion and lien indemnity bond,
satisfactory to Landlord, for said work. All alterations, decorations,
additions, or improvements upon the Leased Premises (other than Tenant\'s
trade fixtures), made by either party, including without limitation, all
wallcoverings, built-in cabinet work, paneling, and the like, shall, unless
Landlord elects otherwise, become the property of Landlord, and shall remain
upon and be surrendered with, the Premises as a part thereof at the
termination of this Lease; except, however, Landlord may, by written notice
to Tenant, given at least thirty (30) days prior to the termination of this
Lease, require Tenant to remove all partitions, counters, railings and the
like installed by Tenant during the term of this Lease, and Tenant shall
repair any damage to the Premises from such removal or, at Landlord\'s
option, shall pay to Landlord all of Landlord\'s costs of such removal and
repair.   (D) In the event the Leased Premises are partially damaged or
destroyed or rendered partially unfit for occupancy by fire or other
casualty, Tenant shall give immediate notice to Landlord. Landlord may repair
the damage and restore the Leased Premises to substantially the same
condition as immediately prior to the occurrence of the casualty. Such
repairs shall be made at Landlord\'s expense unless due to the negligence or
willful misconduct of Tenant or its employees, agents, or invitees. Landlord
shall allow Tenant a fair reduction of rent during the time the Leased
Premises are partially unfit for occupancy. If the Leased Premises are
totally destroyed or deemed by the Landlord to be rendered unfit for
occupancy by fire or other casualty or if Landlord shall decide not to repair
or rebuild after a casualty, this Lease shall terminate and the rent shall be
paid through the time of such casualty.   Section 13 -- Tenant Default and
Removal of Abandoned Property.   If Tenant abandons the Premises or if
Tenant breaches any covenant, warranty, term, or other obligation of this
Lease, then Tenant\'s failure to cure same within ten (10) days thereafter
shall be considered a default (provided, that Tenant\'s failure to make any
payment of rent or Utilities Expense on the due date therefor shall be an
immediate default) and, in the event of a default, Landlord may enforce the
performance of this Lease in any manner provided by law. This Lease may be
terminated at Landlord\'s discretion if such abandonment or default,
including any payment default, continues for a period of ten (10) days after
Landlord notifies Tenant of such abandonment or default and of Landlord\'s
intention to declare this Lease terminated. If Tenant has not completely  
9    removed or cured the default within the 10-day period, this Lease
shall terminate. Thereafter, Landlord or its agents shall have the right,
without further notice or demand, to enter the Leased Premises and remove all
property without being deemed guilty of trespass and without waiving any
other remedies for arrearages of rent or breach of covenant. Upon abandonment
or default by the Tenant, the remaining unpaid portion of the rent from
Section 5 herein, shall become due and payable. Tenant is presumed to have
abandoned the Premises if goods, equipment, or other property, in an amount
substantial enough to indicate a probable intent to abandon the Premises, is
being or has been removed from the Premises and the removal is not within the
normal course of Tenant\'s business. Landlord shall have the right to store
any property of Tenant that remains on the Premises that have been abandoned;
and, in addition to Landlord\'s other rights, Landlord may dispose of the
stored property if Tenant does not claim the property within sixty (60) days
after the date the property is stored, provided Landlord notifies Tenant that
Landlord may dispose of Tenant\'s property if Tenant does not claim the
property within sixty (60) days after the date the property is stored.  
Section 14 -- Default by Landlord.   In the event of breach by Landlord of
any covenant, warranty, term, or obligation of this Lease, then Landlord\'s
failure to cure same or commence a good faith effort to cure same within ten
(10) days after written notice thereof by Tenant shall be considered a
default and shall entitle Tenant either to terminate this Lease or cure the
default, and any expense incurred by Tenant shall be reimbursed by the
Landlord after reasonable notice of the expenses incurred.   Section 15 --
Waiver of Breach.   The waiver by either party of any breach of any
provision of this Lease shall not constitute a continuing waiver or a waiver
of any subsequent breach of the same or a different provision of this
Lease.   10     Section 16 -- Exclusion of Tenant; Landlord Right of
Entry.   (A) Landlord may not intentionally prevent Tenant from entering the
Leased Premises, except by judicial process, unless the exclusion results
from: (1) bona fide repairs, construction, or an emergency; (2) removing the
contents of Premises abandoned by Tenant; or (3) changing the door locks of
Tenant in the event Tenant is in default beyond the 10-day cure period in
paying any potion of the rent. If Landlord or Landlord\'s agent changes the
door locks of Tenant as permitted herein, Landlord or Landlord\'s agent must
place a written notice on Tenant\'s front door stating the name and the
address or telephone number of a contact person.   (B) Landlord shall have
the right, upon reasonable prior notice, during normal business hours to
enter the Leased Premises: (1) to inspect the general condition and state of
repair thereof; (2) to make repairs required or permitted under this Lease;
or (3) for any other reasonable purpose. For each of the aforesaid purposes,
Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all of
the doors in, upon, and about the Premises and Landlord shall have the right
to use any and all means which Landlord may deem proper to open said doors in
an emergency in order to obtain entry to the Premises, and any damages caused
on account thereof shall be paid by Tenant, except for damages caused by the
negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its employees or agents.
Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages for any injury or inconvenience to
or interference with Tenant\'s business, any loss of occupancy or quiet
enjoyment of the Premises, and any other loss occasioned thereby as a result
of such entry by Landlord made pursuant to Section 16. Tenant shall
not change the locks on any entry way without first obtaining the written
consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. In any such event, Tenant\'s new locks shall be tied into
Landlord\'s master locking system for the Premises.   Section 17 --
Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulation.   (A) With respect to the Leased
Premises, Tenant shall, at its own expense, comply with all laws, orders, and
requirements of all governmental entities with reference to the use and
occupancy of the Leased Premises. Tenant and Tenant\'s agents, employees, and
invitees shall comply with any rules and regulations governing the use of the
Buildings or other improvements to the Leased Premises as reasonably required
by Landlord. Landlord may make reasonable changes in any such rules and
regulations from time to time as deemed advisable for the safety, care, and
cleanliness of the Building, provided the same are in writing and are not in
conflict with this Lease. See Rules and Regulations attached hereto
as Exhibit "B" and incorporated herein.   (B) Tenant shall pay any and all
fines or penalties imposed or allegedly imposed for failure to comply with
this Section 17 and shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord from
any claims, demands, or actions by governments, their agencies, boards or
commissions and private parties, arising as a result of Tenant\'s failure to
comply with this Section 17.   11     (C) Tenant shall obtain any
permits as required in connection with its use and occupancy of the Leased
Premises, and shall promptly provide copies thereof to Landlord.   (D)
Landlord does not warrant or represent that the Leased Premises are suitable
or safe for the purpose intended in Section 3 hereof.   (E) The
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 17(B) shall continue after
the expiration or termination of this Lease as to any matters that occurred
during or resulted from the term of this Lease.   Section 18 --
Construction.   (A) This Agreement shall be construed under and in
accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana.   (B) In case any one or
more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be
held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof and this Agreement shall be construed as if such
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been contained
herein.   Section 19 -- Binding; Rights and Remedies Cumulative.   (A)
Subject to the provisions of this Lease pertaining to assignment of
the Tenant\'s interest, all provisions of this Lease shall extend to and bind
or inure to the benefit not only of the parties to this Lease, but to each
and every one of the heirs, executors, representatives, successors and
assigns of Landlord or Tenant.   (B) The rights and remedies set forth in
this Lease are cumulative and the use of any one right or remedy by either
party shall not preclude or waive its right to use any or all other remedies.
Said rights and remedies are in addition to any other rights the parties may
have by law, statute, ordinance or otherwise.   Section 20 -- Lien;
Subordination.   (A) Landlord is granted an express contractual lien, in
addition to any lien provided by law, and a security interest in, all
property of Tenant found on the Leased Premises to secure the compliance by
Tenant with all terms of this Lease.   (B) Landlord is hereby irrevocably
vested with full power and authority to subordinate this Lease to any
mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien hereafter placed on the Leased
Premises, and Tenant agrees on demand to execute promptly such further
instruments in reasonable form and substance subordinating this Lease as
Landlord may request, provided such subordination shall be on the express
condition that this Lease shall be recognized by the mortgagee, and
the rights of Tenant shall remain in full force and effect during the term of
this Lease so long as Tenant shall continue to perform all of the covenants
and conditions of this Lease.   12     Section 21 -- Notices.   All

Subletting; Amendment; Other Agreements Superseded.   (A) Tenant shall not
assign this Lease nor sublet the Leased Premises or any interest therein
without first obtaining the written consent of the Landlord. An assignment or
subletting without the written consent of Landlord shall be void and shall,

in writing, dated subsequent to the date hereof, and duly executed by the
parties.   (C) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the
parties to this Lease with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes any prior understandings or written or oral agreements between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.   (D) Nothing contained

contained herein, nor any acts of the parties herein, shall be deemed to
create any relationship between the parties hereto other than
the relationship of Landlord and Tenant.   Section 23 -- Signs.   (A)
Tenant shall not post or paint any signs at, on, or about the Leased Premises
or paint the exterior walls of the building without prior written consent of
the Landlord. Landlord shall have the right to remove any sign or signs in

the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of

other amounts owing by Tenant to Landlord in accordance with the provisions
of this Lease, shall be entitled to administrative expense claim status under

Disability Act of 1991.   The United States Congress has enacted the

to Landlord\'s right to recover the balance of such rent or pursue any other
remedy provided in this Lease. Tenant agrees that each of the foregoing
covenants and agreements shall be applicable to any covenant or agreement
either expressly contained in this Lease or imposed by any statute or at
common law.   15     Section 28 -- Time of Essence; Counterparts.

maintain, at its own expense, and shall require its Contractor(s), if any, to
procure and maintain for the duration hereunder the insurance coverage
meeting or exceeding the requirements set forth below:   1. Minimum Scope of
Insurance -- Coverage shall be at least as broad as the following:   A.
Commercial General Liability Insurance: Shall be written on ISO occurrence

cover liability arising from premises, operations, independent contractors,
products-completed operations, personal injury, and liability assumed under
an insured contract (including the tort liability of another assumed in a
business contract). If a 1973 edition ISO form must be used by the insurer,

included. Additionally, the policy shall not contain a sunset provision,
commutation clause or any other provision which would prohibit the reporting
of a claim and the subsequent defense and indemnity that would normally be

to include the following:   (i) Premises/Operations;   (ii)
Contractual;   (iii) Independent Contractors;   (iv) Property Damage;  
(v) Personal Injury;   (vi) Cross liability/severability of interest;  
(vii) The policy shall be endorsed using ISO form CG 20 10 11 85  (or a

Primary and  Non-Contributory basis. The coverage shall contain no  special
limitations relating to this Lease or USS as  landlord and/or owner of the
building, and on the scope of  protection afforded to said Additional
Insureds.   (ix) Waiver of subrogation shall be provided to the benefit of 
all additional Insureds, as aforesaid.   (x) No XCU (explosion, collapse,
underground) exclusion.   (xi) For any claims related herein, the Tenant\'s
and/or its  Contractor\'s insurance shall be primary and non-contributory 
respecting the aforesaid Additional Insureds. Any insurance  or self-
insurance maintained by USS shall be in excess of  the Tenant\'s and/or
Contractor\'s insurance and shall not  contribute with it.     (xii) The
policy shall not contain any provision, definition, or  endorsement which
would serve to eliminate third-party  action over claims.   (xiii) Self-
funded or other non-risk transfer insurance  mechanisms are not acceptable to
USS (other than customary  deductibles or self-insured retentions). If the
Tenant has  such a program, full disclosure must be made to USS prior to 
any consideration being given.   B. Workers\' Compensation Insurance: As
required by the State or Commonwealth in which the Building is located.  
C. Employer\'s Liability: Coverages per accident, disease-policy limit, and
disease each employee.   2. Minimum Limits of Insurance -- Tenant and its

be not less than $2,000,000 each occurrence for bodily injury and property
damage; $2,000,000 each occurrence and aggregate for products and completed
operations; $4,000,000 general aggregate.   B. Workers\' Compensation: As
required by the State or Commonwealth in which the Building is located.  
C. Employer\'s Liability: $1,000,000 per accident, $1,000,000 disease-policy
limit, and $1,000,000 disease each employee. (May include Umbrella
coverage.)   3. Deductibles and Self-Insured Retentions -- All insurance
coverage carried by Tenant and its Contractor(s) shall extend to and protect
USS, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates to the full amount of such coverage,
and all deductibles and/or self-insured retentions (if any), including those
relating to defense costs, are the sole responsibility of Tenant and its
Contractor(s).   4. Rating of Insurer -- Insurers must have a minimum rating
of a A- as evaluated by the most current A.M. Best rating guide. If the
insurer has a rating less than an A-, the Contractor must receive specific
written approval from USS prior to proceeding.   5. Other Insurance
Provisions   A. Each insurance policy required by this clause shall be
endorsed to state that coverage shall not be suspended, voided, canceled by
either party, or reduced in coverage or in limits except after sixty (60)
days prior written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, has
been given to USS (except in the case of non-payment of premium, in which
event ten (10) days prior written notice shall be given).   B. These
insurance provisions are intended to be a separate and distinct obligation on
the part of the Tenant. Therefore, these provisions shall be enforceable and
Tenant and/or Contractor(s) shall be bound thereby regardless of whether or
not indemnity provisions are determined to be enforceable in the jurisdiction
in which the work covered hereunder is performed.   2     C. The above-
described insurance coverage to be provided by Tenant and/or its
Contractor(s) hereunder will extend coverage to all work or
services performed hereunder.   D. The obligation of the Tenant and its
Contractor(s) to provide the insurance herein above specified shall not limit
in any way the liability or obligations assumed by the Tenant and its
Contractor(s) hereunder.   E. In the event Tenant and its Contractor(s) or
its insurance carrier defaults on any obligations hereunder, Tenant and its
Contractor(s) agree that they will be liable for all reasonable expenses and
attorneys\' fees incurred by USS to enforce the provisions hereunder.   6.
Evidence of Coverage   A. Tenant and its Contractor(s) shall furnish USS
with copies of the endorsements effecting the coverage required by this
specification. Additionally, prior to the commencement of any work or
services on USS\'s Premises, Tenant and its Contractor(s) and all
subcontractors, if any, shall furnish to USS reasonably satisfactory
Certificates of Insurance evidencing full compliance with the requirements
herein. The Certificates of Insurance must show that the required insurance
is in force, the amount of the carrier\'s liability thereunder, and must
further provide that USS will be given sixty (60) days advance written notice
of any cancellation of coverage or deletion of the certificate holder herein
as an Additional Insured under the policies (except in the case of non-
payment of premium, in which event ten (10) days prior written notice shall
be given).   B. All Certificates of Insurance shall be in form and
content reasonably acceptable to USS and shall be submitted to USS in a
timely manner so as to confirm Tenant and its Contractor(s) full compliance
with the stated insurance requirements hereunder.   C. Any failure on the
part of USS to pursue or obtain the Certificates of Insurance required
hereunder from Tenant and its Contractor(s) and/or the failure of USS to
point out any non-compliance of such Certificates of Insurance shall not
constitute a waiver of any of the insurance requirements hereunder, nor
relieve Tenant or its Contractor(s) of any of its obligations or
liabilities hereunder. Moreover, acceptance by USS of insurance submitted by
the Tenant and its Contractors does not relieve or decrease in any manner the
liability of the Tenant and its Contractor(s) for performance hereunder. The
Tenant and its Contractor(s) are responsible for any losses, claims, and/or
costs of any kind which their insurance does not cover.   7. Subcontractors
-- Contractor(s) shall be responsible for obtaining separate certificates
from each subcontractor. All coverages for subcontractors shall be subject to
all of the requirements stated herein.   3     Exhibit D   INDEMNITY

Agent. The Indemnification Parties shall act in good faith to attempt to
reach a resolution of the Claims(s) within 60 days following the date on
which the Company gives Notice of Objection. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the Claim Shares
from the Indemnity Fund in accordance with the terms of the memorandum. If
Buyer and the Company are unable to agree on any resolution within such
60-day period, the Escrow Agent shall not make any transfer of the Claim
Shares which are subject to such dispute from the Indemnity Fund except
promptly pursuant to a final award determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction from which no appeal can be timely taken. The Escrow Agent shall
take the action specified in joint notices signed by, and received from, the
Indemnification Parties as soon as practical after its receipt thereof.  
(c) Expiration of Escrow Period; Disbursements.   (i) If, on the first
Business Day following the Indemnity Termination Date, (x) all Claim Shares
to which Buyer is entitled in accordance with Section 3(b) hereof have been
transferred to Buyer with respect to each Notice of Claim which has been
given by Buyer on or prior to the Indemnity Termination Date; and (y) no
Notice of Claim which has been given by Buyer is then outstanding, then
within 10 days the Escrow Agent shall transfer all Escrow Shares remaining in
the Indemnity Fund to the Company and likewise shall make the disbursements,
if any, described in Section 8 below.   (ii) If Buyer has made any Claim
against the Indemnity Fund to which the Company has timely given Notice of
Objection or may give a timely Notice of Objection and which remains
outstanding as of the Indemnity Termination Date, the number of Escrow Shares
comprising the Indemnity Fund that are in excess of the Claim Shares subject
to the outstanding Claim or Claims (based on the Indemnity Share Price) shall
be transferred to the Company within such 10-day period, and the Claim Shares
subject to such outstanding Claim or Claims (based on the Indemnity Share
Price) shall remain in the Indemnity Fund and shall continue to be
administered in accordance with the terms hereof. Following the expiration of
the Escrow Period, all Claim Shares shall be valued based on the Indemnity
Share Price. Within 10 days following the resolution of each outstanding
Claim pending on the Indemnity Termination Date and the disbursement of any
Claim Shares to which Buyer is entitled upon resolution of such Claim, the
number of Escrow Shares initially subject to such Claim that are in excess of
the Claim Shares disbursed to Buyer, if any, pursuant to the resolution of
such Claim, shall be transferred to Company. At such time, the Escrow Agent
shall make the disbursements described in Section 8.   (iii) Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall release and
distribute the Indemnity Fund to the Indemnification Parties pursuant to any
joint written instructions executed by the Indemnification Parties or as
directed by a final award determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
from which no appeal can be timely taken.   3     4. Dividends;
Voting.   (a) Any dividends declared and paid, and any distributions made
with respect to, the Escrow Shares shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent and
shall be held and transferred by the Escrow Agent in the same manner that the
Escrow Shares are held and transferred hereunder. Any shares of Buyer Stock
received by the Escrow Agent upon a stock split, stock dividend,
combination, recapitalization or the like made in respect of any securities
in the Indemnity Fund shall be added to the Indemnity Fund and become a part
thereof.   (b) While Escrow Shares remain in the Indemnity Fund, the Company
may vote such Escrow Shares on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders of Buyer during the term of this Agreement, and Buyer shall take
reasonable steps to allow the exercise of such rights.   (c) While Escrow
Shares remain in the Indemnity Fund, the Company will retain and be able to
exercise all other incidents of ownership of such Escrow Shares which are not
inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement.   5. Fees of Escrow Agent. Each of Buyer and the Company shall
pay one-half of the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Escrow
Agent incurred by it in connection with carrying out its duties
hereunder.   6. Rights and Duties of the Escrow Agent.   (a) The duties
and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent shall be determined solely by the
provisions of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent
shall have and may exercise such powers hereunder as are specifically
delegated to the Escrow Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto, including the power to hire attorneys
to represent the Escrow Agent with respect to matters arising from this
Agreement and the power to file actions as it deems necessary in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties and
no obligation to take any action hereunder except for any action specifically
provided by this Agreement to be taken by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall have no responsibility or obligation of any kind in connection with
this Agreement or the Indemnity Fund, and shall not be required to deliver
the same or any part thereof or take any action with respect to any matters
that might arise in connection therewith, other than to receive, hold, and
make delivery of the Indemnity Fund as herein provided or by reason of
any order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal may
timely be taken. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for any
action taken or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court
of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent\'s gross
negligence or willful misconduct or breach of the provisions of this
Agreement was the primary cause of any loss to Buyer or the Company. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled person. In the event that the Escrow
Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall
receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its
opinion, conflict with   4    any of the provisions of this Agreement,
it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole
obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall
be directed otherwise in writing by all of the parties hereto or by a final
order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Buyer and the Company
hereby agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, hold harmless and defend
the Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents and employees
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, fines, penalties and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including incidental expenses and reasonable legal fees and
expenses ("Escrow Agent Losses"), that may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against, the Indemnitees or any of them for following any
instructions or other directions upon which they are authorized to
rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In addition to and not in
limitation of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer and the Company also
agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each
of them harmless from and against any and all Escrow Agent Losses that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees or any of them in
connection with or arising out of the Escrow Agent\'s performance under this
Agreement, provided the Indemnitees have not acted with gross negligence or
engaged in willful misconduct or breached the provisions of this Agreement.
The provisions of this Section 6(a) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent for any reason.
The Escrow Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder by or through
employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact.   (b) The Escrow Agent shall have
the right to resign after first having given the Indemnification Parties
notice in writing of its intent to resign at least 30 days in advance. At the
expiration of such 30 days, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining
Indemnity Fund to a successor Escrow Agent designated in writing by the
Indemnification Parties. If the Indemnification Parties fail to designate a
successor to the Escrow Agent within such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent
shall, at the expense of the Indemnification Parties, institute a bill of
interpleader as contemplated by Section 6(e)(ii) hereof. Any corporation or
association into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
or association resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to
which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any
corporation or association to which all or substantially all the corporate
trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be sold or
otherwise transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without
further act.   (c) If (i) the Indemnity Fund is at any time attached,
garnished or levied upon under any court order, or (ii) the payment,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be
stayed or enjoined by any court order, or (iii) any order, judgment or decree
shall be made or entered by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no
appeal may timely be taken affecting such property or any part thereof, then
in any of such events the Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion,
to rely upon and comply with any such order, judgment or decree which it is
advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, and if it
complies with any such order, judgment or decree it shall not be liable to
any of the parties hereto or to any other person, firm or corporation by
reason of such compliance, even though such order, judgment or decree may be
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.  
5     (d) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the accuracy,
act in reliance upon the contents and assume the genuineness of any
instruction, direction, request or notice which is given to the Escrow Agent
in proper form pursuant to this Agreement and reasonably believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person,
without the necessity of the Escrow Agent verifying the truth or accuracy
thereof. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to investigate or in any way
determine whether Buyer is entitled to indemnification under the Purchase
Agreement or the proper amount of any such indemnification.   (e) Should
any controversy arise between or among the Indemnification Parties or any
other person, firm or entity with respect to this Agreement, the Indemnity
Fund or any part thereof, or the right of any party or other person
to receive the Indemnity Fund, or should the Indemnification Parties fail
to designate another Escrow Agent as provided in Section 6(b) hereof, or if
the Escrow Agent should be in doubt as to what action to take, the Escrow
Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to (i) withhold delivery
of the Indemnity Fund until the controversy is resolved and/or (ii) institute
a bill of interpleader in any court of competent jurisdiction to determine
the rights of the parties hereto (the right of the Escrow Agent to institute
such bill of interpleader shall not, however, be deemed to modify the manner
in which Escrow Agent is entitled to make transfers from the Indemnity Fund
as hereinabove set forth other than to tender the Indemnity Fund into the
possession and control of such court).   (f) Buyer and the Company may, by
joint written direction, request the resignation of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall not be required to resign until its reasonable fees and
out-of-pocket expenses have been paid. Such direction shall also include the
designation of the successor Escrow Agent. Upon the turnover of the Indemnity
Fund to the successor Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall be released from
any further liability or responsibility in connection therewith other than
liability resulting from the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence, willful
misconduct or breach of the provisions of this Agreement.   7. Term. This
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until all Escrow Shares and
other assets comprising the Indemnity Fund have been transferred in
accordance with Section 3 hereof.   8. Escrow Earnings.   (a) Except as
provided in Section 4(a), following the expiration of the Escrow Period or
upon such later final disposition of the Escrow Shares, all income, proceeds,
earnings or distributions on the Indemnity Fund, after payment of expenses or
taxes incurred in connection therewith, shall be paid to Buyer and the
Company pro rata based on the amount of the Indemnity Fund disbursed to such
parties pursuant to this Agreement. All such earnings, including any
cash dividends, shall be reported by the Escrow Agent to the recipients
thereof in the calendar year in which such earnings are paid.   (b) The
Escrow Agent shall invest any cash in the Indemnity Fund at the written
direction of both Buyer and the Company or in the absence of such direction
in the 100%   6    U.S. Treasury Securities Money Market Fund or any
other mutual fund invested solely in United States Treasury obligations for
which the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow Agent serves as
investment manager, administrator, shareholder servicing agent, or custodian
or subcustodian, notwithstanding that (i) the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of
the Escrow Agent receives fees from such funds for services rendered, (ii)
the Escrow Agent charges and collects fees for services rendered pursuant to
this Agreement, which fees are separate from the fees received from such
funds, and (iii) services performed for such funds and pursuant to this
Agreement may at times duplicate those provided to such funds by the Escrow
Agent or its affiliates. Until further written notice, the Escrow Agent shall
invest any cash in the Indemnity Fund in the 100% U.S. Treasury Securities
Money Market Fund. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss
sustained as a result of such investment, or any investment made pursuant to
the instructions of the parties hereto or as a result of any liquidation
of any investment prior to its maturity.   9. Miscellaneous.   (a) Time
Periods. Whenever under the terms hereof the time for giving a notice or
performing an act falls upon a day other than a Business Day, such time shall
be extended to the next Business Day.   (b) Invalidity. If any one or more
of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument
referred to herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the parties shall use their reasonable efforts,
including the amendment of this Agreement, to ensure that this Agreement
shall reflect as closely as practicable the intent of the parties hereto on
the date hereof.   (c) Survival of Indemnification. Notwithstanding
termination of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 6(a) shall remain in
full force and effect for so long as the Escrow Agent may have any
liability.   (d) Default. Any party hereto may (i) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto or
(ii) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any
term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach
or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any
other term or condition, of this Agreement.   (e) Notices. All notices,
demands, requests, consents, approvals or other communications (collectively,
"Notices") required or permitted to be given hereunder or that are given with

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Counterparts to
this Agreement may be delivered via facsimile. In proving this Agreement, it
shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such

Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a written
agreement signed by each of the parties hereto.   (i) Governing Law. This
Agreement shall be construed and interpreted, and the rights of the parties
shall be determined, in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any provision thereof that would require
the application of the substantive laws of any other jurisdiction, except to
the extent that such laws are superseded by the Bankruptcy Code.   (j)
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and all agreements
entered into pursuant hereto and all certificates and instruments delivered
pursuant hereto and thereto constitute the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among Buyer, the
Company and the Escrow Agent with respect to the subject matter hereof.  
(k) Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature under or
by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein.   (l)
Exclusive Jurisdiction. Without limiting any party\'s right to appeal any
order of the Bankruptcy Court, (a) the Bankruptcy Court shall
retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to
decide (insofar as they relate to the Company) any claims or disputes which
may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any  
9    breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (b) any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits and proceedings
related to the foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy
Court, and the parties hereby consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and
venue of the Bankruptcy Court.   (m) Security Procedures. In the event
funds transfer instructions are given, whether in writing, by telecopier or
otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such
instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on
Schedule 1 hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of
anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and
telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually
received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable
to contact any of a party\'s authorized representatives identified in
Schedule 1, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of
such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of such party\'s
executive officers ("Executive Officers"), which shall include the titles of
, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such  ------------------------ Executive
Officer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed
Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation
of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and the
beneficiary\'s bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Company or Buyer to
identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary\'s bank, or (iii) an
intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for
any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when
its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the
transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary\'s bank or a
designated intermediary bank. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that
these security procedures are commercially reasonable.   (n) TINSs. Upon
execution of this Agreement, each of Buyer and the Company shall provide the
Escrow Agent with a fully executed W-8 or W-9 IRS form, which shall include
Buyer\'s and Company\'s Tax Identification Number. In addition, all interest
or other income earned under the Agreement shall be allocated and/or paid as
directed in a joint written direction of Buyer and the Company and reported
by the recipient to the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.
Notwithstanding such written directions, the Escrow Agent shall report and,
as required, withhold any taxes as it determines may be required by any law
or regulation in effect at the time of the distribution. In the absence of
timely direction, all proceeds of the Indemnity Fund shall be retained in the
Indemnity Fund and reinvested from time to time by the Escrow Agent as
provided in Section 3. In the event that any earnings remain undistributed at
the end of any calendar year, the Escrow Agent shall report to the Internal
Revenue Service or such other authority such earnings as it deems appropriate
or as required by any applicable law or regulation or, to the
extent consistent therewith, as directed in writing by Buyer and the Company.
In addition, the Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate
and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.   [Remainder of

Corporation 600 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219  Re: Lock-up
Agreement  Ladies and Gentlemen:  This Lock-up Agreement is delivered to
you in connection with the execution of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement
dated as of January 9, 2003 (the "Purchase Agreement") by and among United
States Steel Corporation ("USS"), National Steel Corporation ("National") and
those subsidiaries of National Steel Corporation listed on the signature
pages to the Purchase Agreement (together with National, "Sellers"). Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, Sellers have agreed to sell certain assets to USS
and USS has agreed to purchase such assets all in accordance with the terms
of the Purchase Agreement. At the closing of the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement, USS will issue shares of Buyer Stock (the "USS
Shares") to Sellers. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.  In
consideration of the issuance of the USS Shares to the Sellers pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending
to be legally bound hereby, the undersigned agrees that the undersigned will
not, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is six months after the Closing Date (the "Lock-up Period"), (i) sell,
contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale
or otherwise dispose of or transfer by any means whatsoever, including,
without limitation, as a gift, any USS Shares, or any options or warrants to
purchase any shares of common stock of USS ("USS Common Stock"), or any
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to
receive shares of USS Common Stock, which during such period are owned
directly by the undersigned (including holding as a custodian) or with
respect to which the undersigned has beneficial ownership within the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (ii) engage
directly or indirectly in any transaction the likely result of which would
involve a transaction prohibited by clause (i).  The foregoing restriction
is expressly agreed to preclude any Seller from engaging in any hedging or
other transaction, during the Lock-up Period, which is designed to, or
reasonably expected to lead to, or result in, a sale or disposition of the
USS Shares even if such shares would be disposed of by someone other than the
undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions include, without
limitation, any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right
(including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any of
the USS Shares or    with respect to any security that includes, relates
to, or derives any significant part of its value from shares of USS Common
Stock.  Each Seller agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer
instructions with USS\'s transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of
the USS Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.  Each
Seller understands that the execution and delivery of this Lock-up Agreement
by each Seller is an inducement for USS to execute the Purchase Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of
the USS Shares to Sellers. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that this
Lock-up Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon each
Seller\'s successors and assigns.  Each Seller understands that the
restrictions with respect to the USS Shares set forth in this Lock-up
Agreement are in addition to any other restrictions upon transfer that may
arise pursuant to any other agreement to which such Seller is a party or
under applicable securities laws.   Very truly yours,   NATIONAL STEEL

"Black-out Period"), if (I)(A) USS is engaged in good faith discussions or
negotiations with respect to, or has proposed or taken a substantial step to
commence, or there otherwise is pending, any merger, acquisition, other form
of business combination, divestiture, tender offer, financing or other
transaction, or there is an event or state of facts relating to USS, in each
case which is material to USS (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors) (any such negotiation, step, event or state of facts being herein
called a "Material Activity"), (B) in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors, after consultation with counsel, disclosure of such Material
Activity would be necessary under applicable securities laws, and (C)
disclosure of such Material Activity would, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors, be adverse to the interests of USS; provided, however
that the Black-out Period will terminate upon public disclosure by USS of
such Material Activity or completion of the transaction, or (II) USS, upon
advice of counsel, deems it necessary to file a post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement or to prepare a supplement to, or otherwise amend,
the form of prospectus contained therein. In the event USS gives such notice,
USS shall extend the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for a period
of time equal to the length of the Black-out Period. USS may not impose more
than one Black-out Period during any 360-day period. During any Black-out
Period each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Shares under the
Registration Statement. USS shall promptly provide Notice to the Holders upon
the termination of any Black-out Period.   (c) Once the Registration
Statement has become effective, USS will, subject to Section 2(d), use all
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement for a period of 30 months thereafter.   (d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2(c), USS shall have no
obligation to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement after
such time as all Holders are permitted by law to sell all of their respective
Registrable Shares pursuant to (a) Rule 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) Rule
144 promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act, as such Rule may
from time to time be amended, without limitation as to volume in any three-
month period or (c) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the
Commission.   (e) Subject to Sections 2(b) and 2(d) hereof, from time to
time, USS will amend or supplement the Registration Statement and prospectus
contained therein as and to the extent necessary to keep the Registration
Statement effective for the period required hereunder   3    and to
comply with the federal securities and any applicable state
securities statute or regulation.   (f) USS will promptly provide Notice to
the Holders (A) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or amendment
has been filed and when the same becomes effective, (B) of any request by the
Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority for
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, (C) of the issuance
by the Commission or any other governmental entity of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or the initiation
of any proceedings for that purpose, and USS will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain
promptly its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued, or (D) of the
receipt by USS of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose.   (g) USS will prepare and promptly file with
the Commission and promptly notify the Holders of the filing of any amendment
or supplement to such Registration Statement or prospectus as may be
necessary to correct any statements or omissions if, at the time when a
prospectus relating to such securities is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, any event shall have occurred as the result of which any such
prospectus would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.   (h)
USS will cause all such Registrable Shares registered hereunder to be listed
on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by USS are
then listed.   (i) USS will provide a transfer agent and registrar for
all Registrable Shares registered pursuant to such registration statement and
a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Shares, in each case not later than
the effective date of such registration.   (j) USS will do all other
customary acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable the Holders to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Shares
contemplated by such registration.   (k) Upon the request of the Majority of
Holders in the Notice delivered pursuant to Section 2(a), USS may elect, in
its absolute and sole discretion, to effect an underwritten offering for the
sale of the Registrable Shares. If USS should elect, in its absolute and sole
discretion, to effect an underwritten offering: (i) the managing underwriter
will be selected by the Majority of Holders with the consent of USS, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (ii) USS shall take all
reasonable and customary actions to expedite and facilitate such underwritten
offering, including, without limitation, entering into an underwriting
agreement in customary form; and (iii) no Holder of Registrable Shares may
participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such Holder, (A)
agrees to sell Registrable Shares on the basis reasonably provided in any
underwriting agreement and (B) completes and executes all questionnaires,
powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents
and instruments required under the terms of the
underwriting arrangements.   4     3. Termination of Registration
Rights. All of each Holder\'s rights under Section 2 of this Agreement shall
expire at such time as all of the Registrable Shares held by such Holder
shall have become eligible for sale in accordance with (i) the provisions of
Rule 144 under the Securities Act without limitation as to volume in any
three-month period or (ii) Rule 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code.   4.
Indemnification and Contribution.   (a) USS shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder and any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act)
for such Holder, each of their officers, directors, shareholders or partners,
and each other person or entity, if any, who "controls" such Holder or
underwriter or entity within the meaning of the Securities Act (collectively,
"Indemnified Persons"), against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
joint or several, to which such Indemnified Person may become subject under
the Securities Act or any other statute or at common law or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
any material fact contained in any registration statement under which
Registrable Shares were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, and shall pay any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending
any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided,
however, that USS shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any
such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any
alleged untrue statement or alleged omission made in such
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary
prospectus or amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to USS by such Holder expressly for use therein
or so furnished for such purposes by any underwriter.   (b) Each Holder
shall indemnify and hold harmless USS, its directors and officers and each
other person or entity, if any, who controls USS within the meaning of the
Securities Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, to which USS or any such director or officer or any such person or
entity may become subject under the Securities Act or any other statute or at
common law, to the extent that such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon written
information provided to USS by such Holder expressly for use in
the registration statement and contained in any registration statement under
which any of such Holder\'s Registrable Shares were registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
provided that the obligations of such Holder shall be several, and not joint
and several, among such Holders on the basis of the number of Registrable
Shares included in such Registration Statement. The aggregate amount which
may be recovered from any Holder of Registrable Shares pursuant to the
indemnification provided in this Section 5(b) in connection with any
registration and sale of   5    Registrable Shares shall be limited to
the total proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable
Shares.   (c) Each person entitled to indemnification under this Section
(the "Indemnified Party") shall give Notice to the party required to
provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may
be sought and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of
any such claim and any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel
for the Indemnifying Party who conducts the defense of such claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party (or, in the case of the Holders, to the Majority of
Holders), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such
Indemnified Party\'s expense, and provided further that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give Notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give
Notice. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim
or litigation, shall (except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, or
in the case of the Holders, the Majority of Holders) consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation. Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding
itself or the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request in writing.   (d) To the extent that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 4 from the Indemnifying Party is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction (by the entry of a final judgment or decree and the
expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) to be
unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of any losses,
claims, damages liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and
the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by
a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4(d) were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. No
person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent  
6    misrepresentation. No Holder of Registrable Shares shall be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such
Holder from the sale of Registrable Shares.   (e) The foregoing indemnity
agreements of USS and the Holders are subject to the condition that, insofar
as they relate to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) that arise out of or are based upon any alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in a prospectus or any alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading but which are
eliminated or remedied in an amendment or prospectus supplement,
such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder
asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage if a copy of the amendment or
prospectus supplement was furnished to the Holder and was not furnished to
the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or prior to the
time such action is required by the Securities Act.   5. Covenants of
Holders. In connection with the Registration Statement, each Holder
agrees:   (a) to provide all such information and material and take all
actions as may be reasonably requested by USS in order to enable USS to
comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws
requirements;   (b) not to take any action that would prevent the
distribution of Registrable Shares included in the Registration Statement to
be made in accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in such
Registration Statement and with all applicable rules and regulations of the
Commission;   (c) not to deliver any form of prospectus in connection with
the sale of any Registrable Shares as to which the USS has advised the
Holders in writing that it is preparing an amendment or supplement; and  
(d) to notify USS promptly in writing upon the sale by the Holder of any
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement.   6. Delivery
of Prospectuses. USS shall furnish to each Holder whose Registrable Shares
are included in the Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement such
number of copies of any prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus,
amendment or prospectus supplement) as such Holder may reasonably request in
order to effect the offer and sale of its Registrable Shares, but only while
said prospectus remains current.   7. Blue Sky Laws. USS shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to effect such qualifications or
registrations under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws as may
be necessary to enable the Holders to offer and sell their Registrable
Shares; provided, however, that USS shall not be obligated to qualify as a
foreign corporation to do business under the laws of any jurisdiction in
which it is not then qualified, or to file any general consent to service of
process.   7     8. Expenses.   (a) USS shall pay all expenses
incurred in complying with this Agreement, including, without limitation, all
registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of
counsel for USS, expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky laws
of any jurisdictions pursuant to Section 7 and expenses and fees for listing
the Registrable Shares on each securities exchange on which shares of USS
Common Stock are then listed. In addition, USS will pay all of its internal
expenses.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8(a)
or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Holders shall bear all underwriting
discounts and/or brokers\' commissions with respect to the shares of Common
Stock sold by them and registered hereunder.   9. Miscellaneous.   (a)
Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement or in any other instrument referred to herein, shall, for
any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
the parties shall use their reasonable efforts, including the amendment of
this Agreement, to ensure that this Agreement shall reflect as closely as
practicable the intent of the parties hereto on the date hereof.   (b)
Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or other
communications (collectively, "Notices") required or permitted to be
given hereunder or that are given with respect to this Agreement shall be in

overnight delivery service with charges prepaid, or transmitted by hand

and any of the terms, covenants or conditions may be waived, only by
a written instrument executed by USS and the Majority of Holders, or in the
case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No waiver of any of the

constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.   (f)
Assignment. The registration rights under this Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of USS

default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) any and

foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the

that notice of the Motion was good and sufficient under the particular
circumstances and that no other or further notice need be given; and the
Court having considered the arguments of counsel at the hearing held on
January 30, 2003 (the "Hearing"); and it appearing that the relief requested
in the Motion is in the best interests of the Debtors, their estates and
creditors and other parties in interest; and upon the record of the Hearing;
and after due deliberation thereon; and good cause appearing therefor, it is
hereby   2     FOUND AND DETERMINED THAT:/2/   A. The Court has
jurisdiction over this matter and over the property of the Debtors and their
respective bankruptcy estates pursuant to 28 U.S.C.(S) 1334 and (S)
157(a).   B. This is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C.(S)
157(b)(2)(A), (N) and (O).   C. The Debtors have articulated good and
sufficient reasons for approving (i) the manner of notice of the Sale Motion,
the Sale Hearing and the assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts,
(ii) the form of notice of the Sale Motion and the Sale Hearing (the "Sale
Notice") to be distributed to creditors and other parties in interest,
including prospective bidders, (iii) the form of notices of the cure amounts
and the assumption of the Assumed Contracts to be filed with the Court and
served on parties to each Assumed Contract, (iv) the Bidding Procedures and
(iv) the Break-Up Fee for the Buyer.   D. The Debtors\' payment to the Buyer
(as set forth in the Agreement), of the Break-Up Fee (a) is an actual and
necessary cost and expense of preserving the Debtors\' estates, within the
meaning of section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) is of substantial
benefit to the Debtors\' estates, (c) is reasonable and appropriate,
including in light of the  ---------- /2/ Findings of fact shall be
construed as conclusions of law and conclusions  of law shall be construed as
findings of fact when appropriate. See Fed. R.  Bankr. P. 7052.  
3    size and nature of the Sale and the efforts that have been and will
be expended by the Buyer notwithstanding that the proposed Sale is subject to
higher or better offers for the Business, (d) was negotiated by the parties
at arms\' length and in good faith, and (e) is necessary to ensure that the
Buyer will continue to pursue its proposed acquisition of the Business. The
Break-Up Fee was a material inducement for, and condition of, the Buyer\'s
entry into the Agreement. The Buyer is unwilling to commit to hold open its
offer to purchase the Business under the terms of the Agreement unless it is
assured payment of the Break-Up Fee. Thus, assurance to the Buyer of payment
of the Break-Up Fee has promoted more competitive bidding by inducing the
Buyer\'s bid that otherwise would not have been made, and without which
bidding would have been limited. Further, because the Break-Up Fee induced
the Buyer to research the value of the Business and submit a bid that will
serve as a minimum or floor bid on which other bidders can rely, the Buyer
has provided a benefit to the Debtors\' estates by increasing the likelihood
that the price at which the Business is sold will reflect its true worth.
Finally, absent authori-zation of the Break-Up Fee, the Debtors may lose the
opportunity to obtain the highest and best available offer for the
Assets.   E. The Bidding Procedures are reasonable and appropriate and
represent the best method for maximizing the return for the Assets.   NOW
THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:   4     Sale
Hearing   1. The Sale Hearing shall be held before the undersigned United
States Bankruptcy Judge, on [_______], 2003 at [__] in the United States
Bankruptcy Court, for the Northern District of Illinois, at which time the
Court shall consider the Sale Motion and confirm the results of the Auction
(as defined in the Motion), if any. Objections to the Sale Motion shall be
filed and served upon counsel to the Debtors, the Buyer, and the Creditor
Constituencies no later than 4:30 (prevailing Central Time) on [__] (the
"Objection Deadline").   2. The failure of any objecting person or entity to
timely file its objection shall be a bar to the assertion, at the Sale
Hearing or thereafter, of any objection to the Sale Motion, the Sale, or the
Debtors\' consummation and performance of the Agreement (including the
transfer of the Assets and Assumed Contracts free and clear of all Inter-
ests), if authorized by the Court.   3. The Sale Hearing may be adjourned
from time to time without further notice to creditors or parties in interest
other than by announcement of the adjournment in open court or on the
Court\'s calendar on the date scheduled for the Sale Hearing or any adjourned
date.   5     Notice   4. Notice of (a) the Sale Motion, (b) the Sale
Hearing, and (c) the proposed assumption and assignment of the Assumed
Contracts to the Buyers pursuant to the Agreement shall be good and
sufficient, and no other or further notice shall be required, if given as
follows:   (a) Notice of Sale Hearing. Within five (5) days after the entry
of this  Order (the "Mailing Date"), the Debtors (or their agents) shall
serve the  Motion, the Agree-ment, the proposed Sale Order, the Bidding
Procedures and  a copy of this Proce-dures Order by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, upon  (i) all entities known to have expressed an interest in a
transaction with  respect to the Acquired Assets or a portion thereof during
the past six (6)  months; (ii) all entities known to have asserted any lien,
claim, interest  or encumbrance in or upon the Acquired Assets; (iii) all
federal, state,  and local regulatory or taxing authorities or recording
offices which have  a reasonably known interest in the relief requested by
the Motion; (iv) all  parties to the Assumed Contracts; (v) the United States
Attorney\'s office;  (vi) the Securities and Exchange Commission; (vii) the
Internal Revenue  Service; and (viii) all entities on the 2002 Service

------------------------------------  United States Bankruptcy Judge  
9     Exhibit A to Sales Procedures Order   NATIONAL STEEL
CORPORATION   Sale Procedures   Set forth below are the sale procedures
(the "Sale Procedures") to be employed with respect to the asset purchase
agreement (the "Agreement") by and among National Steel Corporation and its
subsidiaries ("National Steel" or "Sellers") and United States Steel
Corporation (the "Proposed Purchaser") concerning the prospective sale of the
Acquired Assets (as that term is defined in the Agreement). The Sellers will
seek entry of an order from the Bankruptcy Court authorizing and approving
the Sale (as hereinafter defined) to one or more Qualified Bidders (as
hereinafter defined) which the Sellers, in consultation with Mitsubishi
Corporation ("Mitsubishi"), Marubeni Corporation ("Marubeni"), the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the "Creditors\' Committee") and the
Unofficial Committee of Bondholders of the 9-7/8% Series D Bonds due 2009 and
8-3/8% Series Bonds due 2006 (the "Bondholders Committee," and together
with the Creditors\' Committee, Mitsubishi and Marubeni, the "Committees")
may determine to have made the highest, best or otherwise financially
superior offer (the "Successful Bidder").   Assets to be Sold   The
Sellers are offering for sale in one or more transactions (the "Sale") all or
substantially all of the assets of National Steel (the "Assets"). The
Proposed Purchaser has offered to purchase the Acquired Assets which are
described in the Agreement and which do not include all of the Assets.   The
Bidding Process   The Sellers and their advisors, in consultation with
the Committees, shall (i) determine whether any person is a Qualified
Bidder (hereinafter defined), (ii) coordinate the efforts of Qualified
Bidders in conducting their due diligence investigations, (iii) receive
offers from Qualified Bidders, and (iv) negotiate any offers made to purchase
the Assets (collectively, the "Bidding Process"). Any person who wishes to
participate in the Bidding Process must be a Qualified Bidder. Neither the
Sellers nor their representatives shall be obligated to furnish any
information of any kind whatsoever to any person who is not determined to be
a Qualified Bidder. The Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, shall
have the right to adopt such other rules for the Bidding Process (including
rules that may depart from those set forth herein), which rules will better
promote the goals of the   A-1    Bidding Process and which are not
inconsistent with any of the other provisions hereof or of any Bankruptcy
Court order.   Participation Requirements   Unless otherwise ordered by
the Bankruptcy Court or determined by the Sellers, in consultation with the
Committees, each person (a "Potential Bidder") interested in participating in
the Bidding Process must deliver (unless previously delivered) to the
Sellers:   (i) An executed confidentiality agreement in substantially 
similar form to that attached hereto as Annex A; and   (ii) Current audited
financial statements of the Potential  Bidder, or, if the Potential Bidder is
an entity formed for  the purpose of acquiring the Acquired Assets, current 
audited financial statements of the equity holder(s) of the  Potential
Bidder, or such other form of financial disclosure  acceptable to the Sellers
and their advisors, in  consultation with the Committees, demonstrating
such  Potential Bidder\'s ability to close a proposed transaction.   A
Qualified Bidder is a Potential Bidder that delivers the documents described
in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), and that the Sellers, in consultation with the
Committees, determine is reasonably likely (based on financial information
submitted by the Potential Bidder, the availability of financing, experience
and other considerations deemed relevant by the Sellers, in consultation with
the Committees) to submit a bona fide offer and to be able to consummate the
Sale if selected as a Successful Bidder.   No later than two business days
after a Potential Bidder delivers all of the materials required by
subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, the Sellers shall determine, and shall
notify the Potential Bidder, if such Potential Bidder is a Qualified Bidder.
The Proposed Purchaser is hereby determined to be a Qualified Bidder. In
addition, each indenture trustee under the 9-7/8% Series D Bonds due 2009 and
8-3/8% Series Bonds due 2006 are each hereby deemed to be Qualified Bidders
for the limited purposes of exercising any rights that each may have under
section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code.   A-2     Due Diligence   The
Sellers may afford any Qualified Bidder the time and opportunity to conduct
reasonable due diligence. The Sellers will designate an employee or other
representative to coordinate all reasonable requests for additional
information and due diligence access from such Qualified Bidders. The Sellers
shall not be obligated to furnish any due diligence information after the Bid
Deadline (as hereinafter defined). Neither the Sellers nor any of
their respective representatives are obligated to furnish any information to
any person other than a Qualified Bidder. The Sellers are not responsible
for, and will bear no liability with respect to, any information obtained by
Bidders in connection with the sale of the Assets..   Bid Deadline   A
Qualified Bidder who desires to make a bid shall deliver a written copy of
its bid to (1) Gary P. Cullen and Timothy R. Pohl, Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom (Illinois), 333 West Wacker Drive, Suite 2100, Chicago, IL
60606; and (2) Frank (Terry) A. Savage and Andrew T. Yearley, Lazard Freres and
Co., LLC ("Lazard"), 30 Rockefeller Center, 61st Floor, New York, NY 10020,
not later than 12:00 p.m. (prevailing Central time) on the day that is four
(4) business days prior to the Auction (as defined below) (the
"Bid Deadline"). Lazard shall immediately distribute copies of the bids to
counsel for the Committees. The Sellers, after consultation with the
Committees, shall announce the terms of the highest, best or otherwise
financially superior Qualified Bid(s) received by the Bid Deadline no later
than 5:00 p.m. (prevailing Central time) on the second (2nd) business day
after the Bid Deadline.   Bid Requirements   All bids must include the
following documents (the "Required Bid Documents"):   . A letter stating
that the bidder\'s offer is irrevocable  until the later of (x) 2 business
days after the  Acquired Assets have been disposed of pursuant to these 
Bidding Procedures, and (y) 30 days after the Sale  Hearing.   . An
executed copy of a purchase agreement marked to show  modifications to the
Agreement that the Qualified  Bidder proposes (the "Marked Agreement"), the
overall  value of which must be equal to, or in excess of, at  least $2
million over the sum of the overall value of  the transactions  
A-3     contemplated by the Agreement and the Topping Fee (the  "Required
Bid Value").   . A good faith deposit (the "Good Faith Deposit") in the 
form of a certified check (or other form acceptable to  the Sellers in their
sole discretion) payable to the  order of the Sellers (or such other party as
the  Sellers may determine) in an amount equal to $6.5  million.   .
Written evidence of a commitment for financing or other  evidence of the
ability to consummate the Sale  satisfactory to the Sellers with appropriate
contact  information for such financing sources.   The Sellers, in
consultation with the Committees, may choose to disregard bids that are
conditioned on obtaining financing or on the outcome of unperformed due
diligence by the bidder. A bid received from a Qualified Bidder that includes
all of the Required Bid Documents and meets all of the above requirements is
a "Qualified Bid."   There is no requirement that a Qualified Bid include
more or less Assets than are covered by the Agreement. The Sellers, in
consultation with the Committees, reserve the right to determine (i) the
value of any Qualified Bid, (ii) whether any Qualified Bid (either by itself
or in connection with another Qualified Bid(s) provides overall value to
Sellers that is equal to, or in excess of, the Required Bid Value or any
other Qualified Bid and (iii) which Qualified Bid(s) constitutes the highest,
best and otherwise financially superior offer. The Sellers\' determination in
this regard may include an analysis of the value (whether positive or
negative) of any Assets that are included in or excluded from any Qualified
Bid, the existence or absence of any escrow or indemnity and consideration of
the Topping Fee, if applicable.   Bid Protection   Recognizing the
Proposed Purchaser\'s expenditure of time, energy and resources, the Sellers
have agreed to provide certain bidding protections to the Proposed Purchaser.
Specifically, the Sellers have determined that the Agreement will further the
goals of the Bidding Procedures by setting a floor for which all other
Potential Bids must exceed and, therefore, is entitled to be selected as a
"Stalking Horse Bid." As a result, the Sellers have agreed to pay, in certain
limited circumstances as set forth in the Agreement, a break-up fee of $15
million (the "Topping Fee") to the Proposed Purchaser.   A-4     "As Is,
Where Is"   The sale of the Assets shall be on an "as is, where is" basis
and without representations or warranties of any kind, nature, or description
by the Sellers, their agents or their estate except to the extent set forth
in the applicable agreement of the Successful Bidder as accepted by Sellers.
Except as otherwise provided in the applicable agreement, all of the
Sellers\' right, title and interest in and to the Assets subject thereto
shall be sold free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests,
encumbrances, claims, charges, options and interests thereon and there
against (collectively, the "Interests") in accordance with section 363 and
365 of the Bankruptcy Code, with such Interests to attach to the net proceeds
of the sale of the Assets.   Each Qualified Bidder shall be deemed to
acknowledge and represent that it has had an opportunity to conduct any and
all due diligence regarding the Assets prior to making its offer, that it has
relied solely upon its own independent review, investigation and/or
inspection of any documents and/or the Assets in making its bid, and that it
did not rely upon any written or oral statements, representations, promises,
warranties or guaranties whatsoever, whether express, implied, by operation
of law or otherwise, regarding the Assets, or the completeness of any
information provided in connection therewith or the Auction, except as
expressly stated in these Bidding Procedures or, as to the Successful Bidder,
the terms of the sale of the Assets shall be set forth in the applicable
agreement.   Auction   If one or more Qualified Bids (other than that of
the Proposed Purchaser) have been received, the Sellers shall conduct an
auction (the "Auction") with respect to the Assets. The Auction shall
commence on the date that is three (3) business days prior to the Sale
Hearing (as defined below) at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom (Illinois), 333 West Wacker Drive, 19th Floor, Chicago, Illinois. The
Sellers shall notify all Qualified Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids
of the time and place of the Auction. If there is no timely Qualified Bid
(other than that of the Proposed Purchaser), the Proposed Purchaser shall be
deemed to be the Successful Bidder.   Only a Qualified Bidder who has
submitted a Qualified Bid is eligible to participate at the Auction. During
the Auction, bidding shall begin initially with the highest Qualified Bid and
subsequently continue in minimum increments of at least $1 million. Other
than otherwise disclosed herein, the Sellers, in consultation with the
Committees, may conduct the Auction in the manner they determine will result
in the highest, best or otherwise financially superior offer(s) for the
Assets.   A-5     Upon conclusion of the bidding, the Auction shall be
closed, and the Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, shall (i)
immediately review each Qualified Bid or Bids on the basis of financial and
contractual terms and the factors relevant to the sale process, including
those factors affecting the speed and certainty of consummating the Sale, and
(ii) within one day identify the highest, best or otherwise financially
superior offer(s) for the Assets (the "Successful Bid" and the entity or
entities submitting such Successful Bid, the "Successful Bidder"), which
highest, best or otherwise financially superior offer(s) will provide the
greatest amount of net value to the Sellers after payment of, among other
things, the Topping Fee, if required and advise the Bidders of such
determination.   Acceptance of Qualified Bids   The Sellers shall sell the
Assets to the Successful Bidder upon the approval of the Successful Bid by
the Bankruptcy Court after hearing (the "Sale Hearing"). The Sellers\'
presentation of a particular Qualified Bid to the Bankruptcy Court for
approval does not constitute the Sellers\' acceptance of the bid. The Sellers
will be deemed to have accepted a bid only when the bid has been approved by
the Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing.   Sale Hearing   The Sale
Hearing will be held before the Honorable John H. Squires on April , 2003 at
a.m. (prevailing Central time) at the United  -- ---- States Bankruptcy
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, located in Chicago, Illinois,
but may be adjourned or rescheduled without further notice by an announcement
of the adjourned date at the Sale Hearing.   Following the Sale Hearing
approving the sale of the Assets to the Successful Bidder, if such Successful
Bidder fails to consummate an approved sale, the next highest or otherwise
best Qualified Bid, as disclosed at the Sale Hearing, shall be deemed to be
the Successful Bid and the Sellers shall be authorized, but not required, to
consummate the sale with the Qualified Bidder submitting such bid without
further order of the Bankruptcy Court.   Return of Good Faith Deposit  
Good Faith Deposits of all Qualified Bidders (except for the Successful
Bidder) shall be held in an interest-bearing escrow account until the Sale
Hearing. If a Successful Bidder fails to consummate an approved sale because
of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such Successful Bidder, the
Sellers shall   A-6    be entitled to retain the Good Faith Deposit as
part of its damages resulting from the breach or failure to perform by the
Successful Bidder.   Modifications   The Sellers, in consultation with the
Committees, may (a) determine, which Qualified Bid, if any, is the highest,
best or otherwise financially superior offer; and (b) reject at any time
before entry of an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving a Qualified Bid,
any bid that is (i) inadequate or insufficient, (ii) not in conformity with
the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding Procedures, or the terms
and conditions of sale, or (iii) contrary to the best interests of the
Sellers, their estates and creditors. At or before the Sale Hearing, the
Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, may impose such other terms and
conditions as the Sellers, in consultation with the Committees, may determine
to be in the best interests of the Sellers\' estate, their creditors and
other parties in interest.   A-7     Exhibit H   TRADEMARK LICENSE

Licensee\'s use of the Marks as permitted in this Agreement ("Offensive
Infringement Claim"), Licensor shall provide Company and Licensee not less
than fifteen (15) days\' prior notice of such Offensive Infringement Claim

participate in such Offensive Infringement Claim with counsel of its own
selection. In the event that Company and/or Licensee does not bring a claim
regarding such potential Offensive Infringement Claim within sixty (60) days

amount or recovery for damages from an Offensive Infringement Claim shall be
applied as follows: (i) first, to the party prosecuting the Offensive
Infringement Claim to reimburse such party for its expenses in connection
with the litigation; (ii) second, to the other party(ies) to reimburse such
party(ies) for its(their) expenses in connection with the litigation; and

Mark in the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") or offices of
foreign jurisdictions, including any costs of preparation, prosecution,

--  ----------  /1/ Unless otherwise defined, capitalized terms used
herein shall have the  meanings ascribed to them in the Motion or the
Agreement, as the case may  be; as to any conflicts with respect to such
terms, the meanings contained  in the Agreement shall control over the
meanings contained in the Motion.    all interested parties were offered
an opportunity to be heard with respect to the Motion; and the Court having
reviewed and considered (i) the Motion, (ii) the objections thereto, if any,
and (iii) the arguments of counsel made, and the evidence proffered or
adduced, at the Sale Hearing; and it appearing that the relief requested in
the Motion is in the best interests of the Debtors, their estate and
creditors and other parties in interest; and upon the record of the Sale
Hearing and these cases; and after due deliberation thereon; and good
cause appearing therefor, it is hereby   FOUND AND DETERMINED THAT:/2/  
A. The Court has jurisdiction over this Motion and the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement pursuant to 28 U.S.C. (S)(S)157
and 1334, and this matter is a core proceeding pursuant to 28
U.S.C.(S)157(b)(2)(A) and (N). Venue of these cases and the Motion in this
district is proper under 28 U.S.C.(S)(S)1408 and 1409.   B. The statutory
predicates for the relief sought in the Motion are sections 105, 363, 365,
1145 and 1146(c) of 11 U.S.C.(S)(S)101 et seq. (the "Bankruptcy Code"), and
Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2002, 6004, 6006 and 9014.   C. As evidenced by the
affidavits of service and publication previously filed with the Court, and
based on the representations of counsel at the Hearing, (i) proper, timely,
adequate and sufficient notice of the Motion, the Sale Hearing, the Sale, and
the assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts has been provided in
accordance with 11 U.S.C.(S)(S)102(l), 363 and 365 and Fed. R. Bankr. P.
2002, 6004 and 9014 and in compliance with the Sale Procedures Order, (ii)
such notice was good and sufficient, and appropriate under the particular
circumstances, and (iii) no other or further notice of the Motion, the Sale
Hearing, the Sale, or the assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts
is or shall be required.  ---------- /2/ Findings of fact shall be
construed as conclusions of law and conclusions  of law shall be construed as
findings of fact when appropriate. See Fed. R.  Bankr. P. 7052.   2    
D. As demonstrated by (i) the testimony and other evidence proffered
or adduced at the Sale Hearing and (ii) the representations of counsel made
on the record at the Sale Hearing, the Debtors have marketed the Business and
conducted the sale process in compliance with the Sale Procedures Order and
the Auction was duly noticed and conducted in a non-collusive, fair and good
faith manner.   E. Each Debtor (i) has full corporate power and authority to
execute the Agreement and all other documents contemplated thereby, and the
sale of the Business by the Debtors has been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action of each of the Debtors, (ii) has all of the
corporate power and authority necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, (iii) has taken all corporate action necessary
to authorize and approve the Agreement and the consummation by such Debtors
of the transactions contemplated thereby, and (iv) no consents or approvals,
other than those expressly provided for in the Agreement, are required for
the Debtors to consummate such transactions.   F. Approval of the Agreement
and consummation of the Sale at this time are in the best interests of the
Debtors, their creditors, their estates, and other parties in interest.  
G. The Debtors have demonstrated both (i) good, sufficient, and
sound business purpose and justification and (ii) compelling circumstances
for the Sale pursuant to 11 U.S.C. (S) 363(b) prior to, and outside of, a
plan of reorganization in that, among other things, absent the Sale the value
of the Acquired Assets and the Business will be harmed.   H. A reasonable
opportunity to object or be heard with respect to the Motion and the relief
requested therein has been afforded to all interested persons and entities,
including: (i) the Office of the United States Trustee; (ii) counsel for the
Buyer; (iii) counsel for the Creditors\' Committee; (iv) counsel for the
United Steelworkers of America; (v) counsel to the trustee of the  
3    First Mortgage Bonds; (vi) counsel for Mitsubishi Corporation; (vii)
counsel to Marubeni Corporation; (viii) all entities known to have expressed
an interest in a transaction with respect to the Acquired Assets during the
past six months; (ix) all entities known to have asserted any Interests in or
upon the Acquired Assets; (x) all federal, state, and local regulatory or
taxing authorities or recording offices which have a reasonably known
interest in the relief requested by the Motion; (xi) all parties to Assumed
Contracts; (xii) the United States Attorney\'s office; (xiii) the Securities
and Exchange Commission; (xiv) the Internal Revenue Service; (xv) the
Department of Justice; and (xvi) all entities on the 2002 Service List.  
I. The Agreement was negotiated, proposed and entered into by the Debtors and
the Buyer without collusion, in good faith, and from arm\'s-length
bargaining positions. Neither the Debtors nor the Buyer have engaged in any
conduct that would cause or permit the Agreement to be avoided under 11
U.S.C. (S) 363(n).   J. The Buyer is a good faith purchaser under 11
U.S.C.(S)363(m) and, as such, is entitled to all of the protections afforded
thereby.   K. The Buyer is not an "insider" of any of the Debtors, as that
term is defined in 11 U.S.C.(S)101.   L. The consideration provided by the
Buyer for the Business pursuant to the Agreement (i) is fair and reasonable,
(ii) is the highest or otherwise best offer for the Business, (iii) will
provide a greater recovery for the Debtors\' creditors than would be provided
by any other practical available alternative, and (iv) constitutes reasonably
equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under
the laws of the United States, any state, territory, possession, or the
District of Columbia.   4     M. The Sale must be approved and
consummated promptly in order to preserve the viability of the Debtors\'
Business as a going concern.   N. The transfer of the Acquired Assets to the
Buyer will be a legal, valid, and effective transfer of the Acquired Assets,
authorized pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, and will vest the Buyer with all
right, title, and interest of the Debtors to the Acquired Assets free and
clear of all Interests (as defined below), including, but not limited to
those (A) that purport to give to any party a right or option to effect any
forfeiture, modification, right of first refusal, or termination of the
Debtors\' or the Buyer\'s interest in the Acquired Assets, or any similar
rights, (B) relating to taxes arising under or out of, in connection with, or
in any way relating to the operation of the Business prior to the Closing
Date, and (C) (i) all mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests,
conditional sale or other title retention agreements, pledges,
liens, judgments, demands, encum-brances, rights of first refusal or charges
of any kind or nature, if any, including, but not limited to, any restriction
on the use, voting, transfer, receipt of income or other exercise of any
attributes of ownership and (ii) all debts arising in any way in connection
with any agreements, acts, or failures to act, of any of the Debtors or any
of the Debtors\' predeces-sors or affiliates, claims (as that term is defined
in the Bankruptcy Code), obligations, liabilities, demands, guaranties,
options, rights, contractual or other commitments, restrictions, interests
and matters of any kind and nature, whether known or unknown, contingent or
otherwise, whether arising prior to or subsequent to the commencement of
these bankruptcy cases, and whether imposed by agreement, understanding, law,
equity or otherwise, including but not limited to claims otherwise arising
under doctrines of successor liability to the extent permitted by law
(collectively, "Interests").   5     O. The Buyer would not have entered
into the Agreement and would not consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby, thus adversely affecting the Debtors, their estates, and their
creditors, if the sale of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer and the assignment
of the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Liabilities to the Buyer was not free
and clear of all Interests or any kind or nature whatsoever, or if the Buyer
would, or in the future could, be liable for any of the interests, including,
without limitation, the Excluded Liabilities.   P. Except as expressly set
forth in the Agreement, the Buyer shall have no liability for any liability,
claim (as that term is defined in section 101(5) of the Bank-ruptcy Code) or
other obligation of or against the Sellers related to the Acquired Assets by
reason of the transfer of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer. The Buyer shall
not be deemed, as a result of any action taken in connection with the
purchase of the Acquired Assets, to: (1) be a successor to the Sellers (other
than with respect to the Assumed Liabilities and any obligations arising
under the Assumed Contracts (as such term is defined below) from and after
the Closing Date); or (2) have, de facto or otherwise, merged with or into
the Sellers. The Buyer is not acquiring or assuming any liability, warranty
or other obligation of the Sellers, except as set forth in the Agreement or
in any of the Assumed Contracts.   Q. The Debtors may sell the Acquired
Assets free and clear of all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
because, in each case, one or more of the standards set forth in 11 U.S.C.
(S) 363(f)(1)-(5) has been satisfied. Those (i) holders of Interests and (ii)
non-debtor parties to Assumed Contracts who did not object, or who withdrew
their objections, to the Sale or the Motion are deemed to have consented
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. (S) 363(f)(2). Those (i) holders of Interests and (ii)
non-debtor parties to Assumed Contracts who did object fall within one or
more of the other subsections of 11 U.S.C. (S) 363(f) and are adequately
protected by having their   6    Interests, if any, attach to the cash
proceeds of the Sale ultimately attributable to the property against or in
which they claim an Interest.   R. The sale of the Business to the Buyer is
a prerequisite to the Debtors\' ability to confirm and consummate a plan or
plans of reorganization. The Sale is a sale in contemplation of a plan and,
accordingly, (i) a transfer pursuant to 11 U.S.C. (S) 1146(c), which shall
not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax, and (ii)
securities distributed by Buyer in connection with the Sale and thereafter
pursuant to a plan of reorganization transferred to creditors shall not be
subject to registration in accordance with 11 U.S.C. (S) 1145.   S. The
Debtors have demonstrated that it is an exercise of their sound business
judgment to assume and assign the Assumed Contracts to the Buyer
in connection with the consummation of the Sale, and the assumption and
assignment of the Assumed Contracts is in the best interests of the Debtors,
their estates, and their creditors. The Assumed Contracts being assigned to,
and the liabilities being assumed by, the Buyer are an integral part of
Business being purchased by the Buyer and, accordingly, such assumption and
assignment of Assumed Contracts and liabilities are reasonable, enhance the
value of the Debtors\' estates, and do not constitute unfair
discrimination.   T. The Debtors have (i) cured, or have provided adequate
assurance of cure, of any default existing prior to the date hereof under any
of the Assumed Contracts, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. (S) 365(b)(1)(A)
and (ii) provided compensation or adequate assurance of compensation to any
party for any actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting from a default
prior to the date hereof under any of the Assumed Contracts, within the
meaning of 11 U.S.C. (S) 365(b)(1)(B), and the Buyer has provided adequate
assurance of their future performance of and under the Assumed Contracts,
within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. (S) 365(b)(1)(C).   7     U. Those non-
debtor parties to Assumed Contracts who did not object to the assumption and
assignment of their Assumed Contract are deemed to have consented to the
assumption and assignment of their Assumed Contract to the Buyer.   V.
Approval of the Agreement and assumption and assignment of the
Assumed Contracts and consummation of the Sale of the Acquired Assets at this
time are in the best interests of the Debtors, their creditors, their estates
and other parties in interest.   NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED,
ADJUDGED, AND DECREED THAT,   General Provisions   1. The Motion is
granted, as further described herein.   2. All objections to the Motion or
the relief requested therein that have not been withdrawn, waived, or
settled, and all reservations of rights included therein, hereby are
overruled on the merits.   Approval of the Agreement   3. The Agreement,
and all of the terms and conditions thereof, are hereby approved.   4.
Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. (S) 363(b), the Debtors are authorized to perform their
obligations under and comply with the terms of the Agreement, and consummate
the Sale, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Agreement.   5. The Debtors are authorized and directed to execute and
deliver, and empowered to perform under, consummate and implement, the
Agreement, together with all additional instruments and documents that may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to implement the Agreement, including but
not limited to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, Deposit Escrow
Agreement, Headquarters Lease, Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the Lock-up
Agreement,   8    Registration Rights Agreement, Trademark License
Agreement, and Transition Services Agreement and to take all further actions
as may be requested by the Buyer for the purpose of assigning, transferring,
granting, conveying and conferring to the Buyer or reducing to possession,
the Acquired Assets, or as may be necessary or appropriate to the performance
of the obligations as contemplated by the Agreement, including the payment by
Debtors to Buyer of the Working Capital Adjustment, if any, on the Working
Capital Payment Date, which obligation shall be an allowed administrative
claim pursuant to 11 U.S.C. (S) (S) 503(b) and 507(a)(1), and be payable by
the Debtors in accordance with the Agreement without further order.   6.
This Order and the Agreement shall be binding in all respects upon
all creditors (whether known or unknown) of any Debtor, all non-debtor
parties to the Assumed Contracts, all successors and assigns of the Buyer,
the Debtors and their affiliates and subsidiaries, the Business, and any
subsequent trustees appointed in the Debtors\' chapter 11 cases or upon a
conversion to chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code and shall not be subject to
rejection. Nothing contained in any chapter 11 plan confirmed in these
bankruptcy cases or the confirmation order confirming any such chapter 11
plan shall conflict with or derogate from the provisions of the Agreement or
this Order.   7. The Agreement and any related agreements, documents, or
other instruments may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties
thereto in accordance with the terms thereof without further order of the
Court; provided that any such modification, amendment, or supplement is not
material.   Transfer of Assets   8. Except as expressly permitted or
otherwise specifically provided for in the Agreement or this Order, pursuant
to 11 U.S.C. (S)(S) 105(a) and 363(f), the Acquired Assets shall  
9    be transferred to the Buyer, and upon consummation of the Agreement
(the "Closing") shall be, free and clear of all Interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever with all such Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever to
attach to the net proceeds of the Sale in the order of their priority, with
the same validity, force and effect which they now have as against the
Acquired Assets, subject to any claims and defenses the Debtors may possess
with respect thereto.   9. Except as expressly permitted or otherwise
specifically provided by the Agreement or this Order, all persons and
entities, including, but not limited to, all debt security holders, equity
security holders, governmental, tax, and regulatory authorities, lenders,
trade and other creditors, holding Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
against or in the Debtors or the Acquired Assets (whether legal or equitable,
secured or unsecured, matured or unmatured, contingent or non-contingent,
senior or subordinated), arising under or out of, in connection with, or in
any way relating to, the Debtors, the Acquired Assets, the operation of the
Business prior to the Closing Date, or the transfer of the Acquired Assets to
the Buyer, hereby are forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from
asserting against the Buyer, its successors or assigns, its property, or the
Acquired Assets, such persons\' or entities\' Interests.   10. Nothing in
the Order or the Agreement releases or nullifies any liability to a
governmental entity under police or regulatory statutes or regulations that
any entity would be subject to as the owner or operator of property after the
date of entry of this Order.   11. The transfer of the Acquired Assets to
the Buyer pursuant to the Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and effective
transfer of the Acquired Assets, and shall vest the Buyer with all right,
title, and interest of the Debtors in and to the Acquired Assets free and
clear of all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever.   10     12.
If any person or entity that has filed financing statements,
mortgages, mechanic\'s liens, lis pendens, or other documents or agreements
evidencing Interests in the Debtors or the Acquired Assets shall not have
delivered to the Debtors prior to the Closing Date, in proper form for filing
and executed by the appropriate parties, termination statements, instruments
of satisfaction, releases of all Interests which the person or entity has
with respect to the Debtors or the Acquired Assets or otherwise, then (a) the
Debtors are hereby authorized and directed to execute and file such
statements, instruments, releases and other documents on behalf of the person
or entity with respect to the Acquired Assets and (b) the Buyer is hereby
authorized to file, register, or otherwise record a certified copy of this
Order, which, once filed, registered or otherwise recorded, shall constitute
conclusive evidence of the release of all Interests in the Acquired Assets of
any kind or nature whatsoever.   Assumption and Assignment  to Buyer of
Assumed Contracts   13. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. (S)(S) 105(a) and 365, and
subject to and conditioned upon the Closing of the Sale, the Debtors\'
assumption and assignment to the Buyer, and the Buyer\'s assumption on the
terms set forth in the Agreement, of the Assumed Contracts is hereby
approved, and the requirements of 11 U.S.C. (S) 365(b)(1) with respect
thereto are hereby deemed satisfied.   14. The Debtors are hereby authorized
and directed in accordance with 11 U.S.C. (S)(S) 105(a) and 365 to (a) assume
and assign to the Buyer, effective upon the Closing of the Sale, the Assumed
Contracts free and clear of all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
and (b) execute and deliver to the Buyer such documents or other instruments
as may be necessary to assign and transfer the Assumed Contracts and Assumed
Liabilities to the Buyer.   11     15. With respect to the Assumed
Contracts: (a) the Assumed Contracts shall be transferred and assigned to,
and following the closing of the Sale remain in full force and effect for the
benefit of, the Buyer in accordance with their respective terms,
notwithstanding any provision in any such Assumed Contract (including those
of the type described in sections 365(b)(2) and (f) of the Bankruptcy Code)
that prohibits, restricts, or conditions such assignment or transfer and,
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. (S) 365(k), the Debtors shall be relieved from any
further liability with respect to the Assumed Contracts after such assignment
to and assumption by the Buyer; (b) each Assumed Contract is an executory
contract of the Debtors under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; (c) the
Debtors may assume each Assumed Contract in accordance with Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code; (d) the Debtors may assign each Assumed Contract
in accordance with Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and any
provisions in any Assumed Contract that prohibit or condition the assignment
of such Assumed Contract or allow the party to such Assumed Contract to
terminate, recapture, impose any penalty, condition renewal or extension, or
modify any term or condition upon the assignment of such Assumed Contract,
constitute unenforceable anti-assignment provisions which are void and of no
force and effect; (e) all other requirements and conditions under Section 363
and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption by the Seller and
assignment to the Buyer of each Assumed Contract have been satisfied; (f)
upon Closing, in accordance with Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code,
the Buyer shall be fully and irrevocably vested in all right, title and
interest of each contract; and (g) each non-Debtor party to an Assumed
Contract that has not objected to the assumption and assignment of such
Assumed Contract to Buyer is deemed to have consented to the assumption and
assignment of such Assumed Contract to Buyer and is forever barred from
arguing otherwise.   12     16. All defaults or other obligations of the
Debtors under any Assumed Contract arising or accruing prior to the Closing
Date (without giving effect to any acceleration clauses or any default
provisions of the kind specified in section 365(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code)
shall be cured by the Debtors by the payment of the Cure Amount associated
with such Assumed Contract at the Closing of the Sale or as soon thereafter
as practicable, and the Buyer shall have no liability or obligation arising
or accruing prior to the date of the Closing of the Sale, except as otherwise
expressly provided in the Agreement.   17. Each non-Debtor party to an
Assumed Contract hereby is forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined
from asserting against the Debtors or the Buyer, or the property of either of
them, any default existing as of the Closing Date of the Sale.   18. Except
as provided in the Agreement or this Order, after the Closing, the Debtors
and their estates shall have no further liabilities or obligations with
respect to any assumed liabilities and all holders of such claims are forever
barred and estopped from asserting such claims against the Debtors, their
successors or assigns, their property or their assets or estates.  
Additional Provisions   19. The consideration provided by the Buyer for the
Business under the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute reasonably
equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under
the laws of the United States, any state, territory, possession, or the
District of Columbia.   20. The consideration provided by the Buyer for the
Business under the Agreement is fair and reasonable and may not be avoided
under section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.   21. On the Closing Date of
the Sale, each of the Debtors\' creditors is authorized and directed to
execute such documents and take all other actions as may be necessary to
release its   13    Interests in the Acquired Assets, if any, as such
Interests may have been recorded or may otherwise exist.   22. This Order
(a) shall be effective as a determination that, on the Closing Date, all
Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever existing as to the Debtors or the
Acquired Assets prior to the Closing have been unconditionally released,
discharged and terminated (other than the Surviving Obligations), and that
the conveyances described herein have been effected and (b) shall be binding
upon and shall govern the acts of all entities including without limitation,
all filing agents, filing officers, title agents, title companies, recorders
of mortgages, recorders of deeds, registrars of deeds,
administrative agencies, governmental departments, secretaries of state,
federal, state, and local officials, and all other persons and entities who
may be required by operation of law, the duties of their office, or contract,
to accept, file, register or otherwise record or release any documents or
instruments, or who may be required to report or insure any title or state of
title in or to any of the Acquired Assets.   23. Each and every federal,
state, and local governmental agency or department is hereby directed to
accept any and all documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.   24. All
entities who are presently, or on the Closing Date may be, in possession of
some or all of the Acquired Assets are hereby directed to surrender
possession of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer on the Closing Date.   25.
This Court retains jurisdiction to enforce and implement the terms
and provisions of the Agreement, all amendments thereto, any waivers and
consents thereunder, and of each of the agreements executed in connection
therewith in all respects, including, but not limited to, retaining
jurisdiction to (a) compel delivery of the Acquired Assets to the Buyer, (b)
compel   14    delivery of the purchase price or performance of other
obligations owed to the Debtors, (c) resolve any disputes arising under or
related to the Agreement, and (d) interpret, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this Order.   26. The transactions contemplated by the
Agreement are undertaken by the Buyer in good faith, as that term is used in
section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly, the reversal or
modification on appeal of the authorization provided herein to consummate the
Sale shall not affect the validity of the Sale to the Buyer (including the
assumption and assignment of any of the Assumed Contracts), unless such
authorization is duly stayed pending such appeal. The Buyer is a Buyer in
good faith of the Acquired Assets, and is entitled to all of the protections
afforded by section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code.   27. The terms and
provisions of the Agreement and this Order shall be binding in all respects
upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Debtors, their estates, and
their creditors, the Buyer, and its respective affiliates, successors and
assigns, and any affected third parties including, but not limited to, all
persons asserting an Interest in the Acquired Assets to be sold to the Buyer
pursuant to the Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent appointment of any
trustee(s) under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, as to which trustee(s)
such terms and provisions likewise shall be binding.   28. The failure
specifically to include any particular provisions of the Agreement in this
Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness of such provision, it
being the intent of the Court that the Agreement be authorized and approved
in its entirety.   29. The Agreement and any related agreements, documents
or other instruments may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties
thereto, in a writing signed by both parties, and in accordance with the
terms thereof, without further order of the Court, provided that any  
15    such modification, amendment or supplement does not have a material
adverse effect on the Debtors\' estates. In the event that there is a
conflict between the terms of this Order and the Agreement, the terms of the
Agreement shall control.   30. The transfer of the Acquired Assets pursuant
to the Sale is a transfer pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code,
and accordingly shall not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or a
sale, transfer, or any other similar tax. Each and every federal, state and
local government agency or department is hereby directed to accept any and
all documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the
transfer of any of the Acquired Assets, all without imposition or payment of
any stamp tax, transfer tax, or similar tax.   31. The securities to be
distributed by Buyer in connection with the Sale and thereafter by Debtors
pursuant to a plan of reorganization shall not be subject to registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 in accordance with 11 U.S.C. (S) 1145.

of Bankruptcy Procedure, this Order shall not be stayed for 10 days after the
entry of the Order and shall be effective immediately upon entry.   33. All
