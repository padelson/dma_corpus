contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which
such Buyer Party is a party. There is no proposed, pending or, to the Buyers

affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

is bound or to which any of the Buyer Parties assets are subject, except
where the violation, conflict, breach, default, acceleration, termination,
modification, cancellation, failure to give notice, right to payment or other
compensation or Encumbrance would not, or could not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, delay or materially affect any Buyer
Parties ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any other Transaction Agreement to which such Buyer Party is a party.

consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, as applicable. In deciding
to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, each Buyer Party
has relied solely upon its own knowledge, independent investigation, review
and analysis, examination, inspection and determination (and that of its
representatives) with respect thereto, and not on any disclosure or
representation made by, or any duty to disclose on the part of, the Seller,
its Affiliates, or any of their respective representatives, other than the

Acquired Equity Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act
by reason of their issuance in a transaction exempt from the registration and
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and have not been
qualified under any state securities Laws on the grounds that the offering
and sale of securities contemplated by this Agreement are exempt from
registration thereunder; and (ii) the Seller Parties reliance on such
exemptions is predicated on the Buyers representations set forth herein. The
Buyer understands that the resale of the Acquired Equity Interests may be
restricted indefinitely, unless a subsequent disposition thereof is registered
under the Securities Act and registered under any state securities Law or are
exempt from such registration. The Buyer is an "accredited investor" as that
term is defined in Rule 501 of

 



22  Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. The Buyer is
able to bear the economic risk of the acquisition of the Acquired Equity
Interests pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including a complete loss
of the Buyers investment in the Acquired Equity Interests, for an indefinite
period of time and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
acquisition of the Acquired Equity Interests. For purposes of state "blue sky"
Laws, the Buyer represents and warrants that the principal executive offices
of the Buyer are located in the State of Texas and that the decision by the
Buyer Parties to acquire the Acquired Equity Interests shall be deemed to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the Closing is not subject to
any condition or contingency with respect to financing from any source.

 

(i) _Litigation_. There is no legal, equitable, bankruptcy, administrative or
other action or proceeding pending or, to the Buyers Knowledge, threatened
against Buyer before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority, which questions
or challenges the validity of this Agreement or any action taken or to be
taken by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer does not have
Knowledge of any such action, proceeding or investigation which the Buyer
believes is reasonably likely of assertion, other than potential inquiries by
the FTC.

Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller Party and each Subject Entity has full
power and authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged, and to
own and use the properties owned and used by it except where the failure to

under this _Section 5(j)(i)_ no later than the seven days prior to the end

41 (2) with respect to a Business Employee who has received an offer of
employment pursuant to subparagraph (1) above and is a Business Employee on
Leave on his or her scheduled Hire Date (as defined herein), the Buyers offer
of employment shall not become effective unless and until such Business
Employee on Leave satisfies the Buyers standard "return to work procedure"
within six months of the end of the Continuation Period (unless applicable Law
requires a longer period),

 

(3) with respect to a Business Employee on Leave on the date offers of
employment are given by the Buyer as provided in subparagraph (1) above who

offer of employment on that date, and will not receive an offer unless and
until such Business Employee on Leave satisfies the Buyers standard "return
to work procedures" within six months of the end of the Continuation Period
(unless applicable Law requires a longer period),

(5) each offer of employment made by the Buyer to a Business Employee or
Business Employee on Leave as provided above shall be conditioned upon such
Business Employee or Business Employee on Leave satisfactorily passing the
Buyers standard pre-employment screening and testing procedures and
remaining employed with the Seller until such individuals Hire Date or Late

(6) a Buyer offer of employment must be accepted within seven days following

Business Employee on Leave shall be effective on the date immediately
following the date

 



42  the Business Employee on Leave satisfies the Buyers standard "return to

Business Employee on Leave who receives and timely accepts an offer of
employment with the Buyer in accordance with its terms must commence active
employment with the Buyer on his or her Hire Date or Late Hire Date, as
applicable, to become a " _Buyer Employee_ ". Notwithstanding anything in

Employee(s) or Business Employee(s) on Leave receiving a Buyer offer of
employment.

Employee on Leave, or (ii) recommend or suggest that any Business Employee or
Business Employee on Leave decline the Buyers offer of employment. The
Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer in its efforts to conduct its standard
pre-employment background checks and other standard screening procedures and
to communicate its offers of employment.

 

(E) Each Buyer Employees employment with the Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be "employment at will" and nothing in this Agreement, in any offer or
otherwise shall obligate the Buyer or its Affiliates to continue the
employment of any Buyer Employee for any period of time or otherwise limit the
Buyers or its Affiliates rights to at any time (i) establish or modify the
terms and conditions of the employment of any Buyer Employee or (ii) terminate
the employment of any Buyer Employee for any reason or for no reason.

 

(iii) _Employment Terms_.

available to each Buyer Employee such Benefit Plans that the Buyer and or its
employing Affiliates makes available to its substantially similarly-situated

Hire Date, as applicable, the Buyer shall cause each applicable Buyer Benefit
Plan to credit for all purposes, including, without limitation, eligibility,
vesting and benefit levels (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit
plan), the service 

 



43  of each Buyer Employee that is credited with the Seller and its Affiliates
immediately prior to his or her Hire Date or Late Hire Date, but only to the
same extent that such service is properly recognized under an analogous
Seller Benefit Plan (as defined herein) immediately prior to such individuals
Hire Date or Late Hire Date, as applicable; provided, however, any such prior
service that would result in a duplication of benefits for the same credited
period may be excluded by the Buyer.

(C) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each
Buyer Employee to be eligible to participate in such applicable Buyer Benefit
Plans on his or her Hire Date or Late Hire Date, without any waiting time, and
(ii) for purposes of participating in any Buyer Benefit Plan made available
to the Buyer Employee that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits, (x) all pre-existing condition exclusions of such Buyer
Benefit Plan shall be waived for such Buyer Employee and his or her
eligible dependents, unless and to the extent the Buyer Employee was subject
to such conditions under an analogous Seller Benefit Plan that such Buyer
Employee was otherwise eligible to participate in immediately prior to his or
her Hire Date or Late Hire Date, and (y) credit shall be given for all co-
payments, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs and similar expenses paid by the
Buyer Employee pursuant to an analogous Seller Benefit Plan during the plan
year of such Buyer Benefit Plan in which the Hire Date or Late Hire Date
occurs.

(" _Seller Benefit Plan_ ") or any liability or obligation to any Seller
Benefit Plan, or (ii) any Seller Employee Liability. For purposes of this
_Section 5(j)(v)_, " _Seller Employee Liability_ " means any and all
liabilities, costs, expenses, claims, losses, damages and obligations, whether

resulting from any claim made by a Buyer Employee that results from or is
based upon an accident, incident or event occurring, or occupational disease
that begins, on or after the Buyer Employees Hire Date or Late Hire Date,
shall be the liability or obligation of the Buyer or an Affiliate of the

for "continuation coverage" to its employees and all other former employees of
the Seller and their "qualified beneficiaries" with respect to a Seller
Benefit Plan that is not the obligation of the Buyer as provided above,
including any Buyer Employee and his or her "qualified beneficiaries" for whom
a "qualifying event" occurs prior to the Hire Date or Late Hire Date, as

for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice or any applicable
penalties arising under the WARN Act relating to any acts or omissions of

(x) _Involuntary Termination_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
5(j)_ to the contrary, the Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided to
each Buyer Employee whose employment with the Buyer or its Affiliates

amount than the greatest of (i) the severance pay and benefits set forth on
_Schedule 5(j)(x)_, (ii) the severance pay and benefits under the severance
plan, program, policy or arrangement, if any, made available to similarly
situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates, and (iii) any contractual,
statutory or common law severance pay and benefits required to be provided
under applicable Law.

 

(xi) _No Solicitation_. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to
this _Section 5(j)_, for one year following the Closing Date, each of the
Buyer and the Seller agrees not to (and shall use its best efforts to cause
its Affiliates not to) solicit, hire, offer employment to or employ any
employee of the other Party (or any of its Affiliates) without the prior
written consent of the Buyer or the Seller, as applicable; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not prohibit general solicitations of employment not
specifically directed toward such employees or the hiring of such

direct or indirect prior solicitation of such individual by the applicable
Party or any of its Affiliates. 

(xii) _Benefit Plans_. The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this  _Section 5(j)_ are solely included for the
benefit of the Buyer and the Seller, and that nothing in this _Section 5(j)_,

establishment, amendment, modification or termination of any Benefit Plan or
any other employee benefit plan, agreement, policy or other arrangement or
shall create any third party beneficiary or any other rights in

 



46  any other Person, including any Business Employees, any former Business

with or furnished to the SEC by the Buyer pursuant to clause (ii) of this
_Section 5(k)_.

(l) _Notifications; Amendment of Schedules_. Each Party agrees to promptly
notify the other Party if such Party obtains Knowledge that any
representation or warranty of the other Party is, or will be, untrue on or
before the Closing Date. Each Party further agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of such Party contained in  _Articles 3_ and
_4_ of this Agreement, as applicable, such Party shall have the continuing
obligation until the Closing to correct, supplement, or amend promptly the
Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which,
if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required
to be set forth or described in the Schedules. Any such correction,
supplement, or amendment shall be delivered to the other Party as soon as
reasonably practical, but no later than three Business Days after discovery
and Knowledge of the Party, but in any event, prior to the Closing Date. If
any such correction, supplement or amendment would constitute a breach of the
disclosing Partys representations and warranties hereunder and such breach
would reasonably be expected to result in a Seller Adverse Effect (if the
disclosing Party is the Seller) or a Buyer Adverse Effect (if the disclosing
Party is the Buyer), then the receiving Party may terminate this Agreement by
delivering a written notice of termination to the disclosing Party within ten
days of the earlier of (i) such notification under the first sentence hereof
or (ii) receipt of such correction, supplement or amendment (which
termination notice shall specify the representation or warranty breached,
identify the specific facts in the correction, supplement or amendment that
constitute the breach and describe the Seller Adverse Effect or Buyer
Adverse Effect, as applicable). For all purposes of this Agreement, including
for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article 7_
have been fulfilled, the Schedules shall be deemed to include only that
information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be
deemed to exclude all information contained in any such correction,
supplement, or amendment thereto.

provisions of _Article 9_.

Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Seller ever be required to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for Losses under _Section 8(b)(i)_ in an
amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the Cap Amount.

 



56 (c) _Indemnification Provisions for the Benefit of the Seller_.

 

(i) After Closing, in the event: (x) of any inaccuracy in, or violation or
breach of, any of the Buyers representations or warranties (without giving
effect to any supplement to the Schedules or any qualification as to
materiality, monetary amount, value or concepts of similar import) contained
in _Article 3_ (other than the Buyer Fundamental Representations and
Warranties); (y) there is an applicable survival period pursuant to _Section
8(a)_; and (z) the Seller Indemnitees make a written claim for indemnification
against the Buyer (or give notice of a Third Party Claim) pursuant to
_Section 11(k)_ within such survival period, then from and after Closing the
Buyer agrees to release, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees
from and against any Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnitees to the extent
relating to or arising from such inaccuracy, violation, or breach; _provided_
that the Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees from any such inaccuracies, violations, or breaches until the
Seller Indemnitees, in the aggregate, have suffered Losses by reason of the
sum of all such inaccuracies, violations or breaches in excess of an aggregate
deductible amount equal to the Deductible Amount, at which point the Buyer
shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against all
Losses exceeding the Deductible Amount.

(ii) After Closing, in the event: (x) of (1) any breach of the Buyers
covenants or obligations in this Agreement, (2) any inaccuracy in, or
violation or breach of, any representation or warranty (without giving effect
to any supplement to the Schedules or any qualification as to materiality,
monetary amount, value or concepts of similar import) contained in the Buyer
Fundamental Representations and Warranties, or (3) any Losses resulting from
any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by
any third party (that is not the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller) against
the Seller after the Closing that pertains to the operation of the Business or
the ownership of the Business Assets or the Acquired Equity Interests prior
to, on or after the Closing, including any claims relating to any Preferential
Rights identified on _Schedule 4(r)_ or the Special Buyer Indemnity
Obligations, except to the extent constituting a Special Seller
Indemnity Obligation, (y) there is an applicable survival period pursuant to
_Section 8(a)_; and (z) the Seller Indemnitees make a written claim for
indemnification against the Buyer (or give notice of a Third Party Claim)
pursuant to  _Section 11(k)_ within such survival period, then from and
after the Closing, the Buyer agrees to release and indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees from and against the entirety of any Losses suffered by the Seller
Indemnitees to the extent relating to or arising from such inaccuracy,
violation, breach or Loss described in clause (x) of this _Section 8(c)(ii)_.

 

(iii) To the extent any Seller Indemnitee becomes liable to, and is ordered to
and does pay to any third party that is not a Seller Indemnitee, punitive,
exemplary, special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages caused by
any matter for which such

 



57  Seller Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8(c)_,
then such punitive, exemplary, special, indirect, incidental or consequential
damages shall be deemed actual damages to such Seller Indemnitee and included
within the definition of Losses for purposes of this _Section 8_. Except to
the extent specified in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to
third party claims, the Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnitee
for any punitive, exemplary, special, indirect, incidental or consequential
damages, including Losses for lost revenue or lost profits, or Losses relating
to any matter to the extent that such matter has been taken into account in
connection with the Purchase Price adjustment under _Section 2(f)_.

(iv) With respect to Losses suffered by any Company Joint Venture Entity for
which indemnification by the Buyer is required hereunder, the Buyer shall be
obligated to indemnify such Seller Indemnitee only for such Losses in an
amount equal to the Percentage Interest applicable thereto.

(v) After Closing, notwithstanding anything in _Section 8(c)(i)_ of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Buyer ever be required to
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for Losses under _Section 8(c)(i)_ in an
amount exceeding, in the aggregate, the Cap Amount.

 

(d) _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 

(i) If any third party shall notify any Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") that is reasonably expected to give rise to a claim for
indemnification against a Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this 
_Article 8_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event
within five Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim)
notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. Failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense of
such claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give
such notice, including having the effect of tolling or suspending the statute
of limitations applicable to such claim.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim which provides for
or results in any payment by or Obligation of the Indemnified Party of or for
any damages or other amount, any Encumbrance on any property of the
Indemnified Party, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party or any sanction or injunction of, restriction upon the
conduct of any business by, or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld, delayed or conditioned unreasonably). 

 



58 (iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 8(d)(i)_, the Indemnified Party
may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate.

 

(iv) In no event shall the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be withheld, delayed or conditioned unreasonably.

 

(e) _Waiver of Rights and Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if (x) the Buyer obtains Knowledge of the breach of, or
inaccuracy with respect to, any representation or warranty of the Seller under
this Agreement (other than any Seller Fundamental Representations and
regardless of whether such Knowledge is obtained by inspection or
investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Buyer or its directors,
officers, employees, or representatives at any time and regardless of whether
notice of such Knowledge has been given to the Seller), and nonetheless
proceeds to the Closing, the Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any rights
and remedies set forth in this Agreement with respect to such breach or
inaccuracy, and (y) the Seller obtains Knowledge of the breach of, or
inaccuracy with respect to, any representation or warranty of the Buyer under
this Agreement (other than any Buyer Fundamental Representations and
regardless of whether such Knowledge is obtained by inspection or
investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Seller or its directors,
officers, employees, or representatives at any time and regardless of whether
notice of such Knowledge has been given to the Buyer), and nonetheless
proceeds to the Closing, the Seller shall be deemed to have waived any rights
and remedies set forth in this Agreement with respect to such breach or
inaccuracy.

(f) _Determination of Amount of Losses; Duty to Mitigate_. The Losses giving
rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the loss
actually suffered by the Indemnified Party (reduced by (i) any insurance
proceeds or other payments or recoupment received, realized or retained by the
Indemnified Party as a result of the events giving rise to the claim for
indemnification net of any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds,
payment or recoupment and (ii) any Tax Benefit recognized by the Indemnified
Party (or the affiliated group of which it is a member) occasioned by such
loss or damage). The amount of the actual loss and the amount of the indemnity
payment shall be computed by taking into account the timing of the loss or
payment, as applicable, using a Prime Rate plus 2% interest or discount rate,
as appropriate (not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law).
Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with information sufficient to allow
the Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the indemnity payment in
accordance with this _Section 8(f)_. Each Party shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to recover under insurance policies or similar agreements
for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement. If the
Indemnified Party receives insurance proceeds for Obligations after an
indemnification payment for such Losses has been made by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party will refund the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance proceeds received by the
Indemnified Party. An Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate damages in respect of any claim for which it is
seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid any costs
or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot
be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

 



59 (g) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties hereto agree that all
indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment
made under _Section 9,_ shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for
Tax purposes.

 

(h) _Exclusive Post-Closing Remedy_. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, after the Closing, the rights and remedies set forth in this
_Article 8_ and _Article 9_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive rights and
remedies of the Parties under or with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, except for any non-monetary, equitable relief to which any Party
may be entitled or any remedies for willful misconduct or fraud.
Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 8(h)_ to the contrary, this
_Section 8(h)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect any Partys right to
seek the remedy of specific performance as contemplated by _Section 11(q)_
or any right or remedy (including monetary remedies) for any claim arising
from the willful or intentional misrepresentation or misconduct or fraud of
any Party. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS _S ECTION 8(H)_, AFTER THE CLOSING, EACH OF THE PARTIES,
ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND OF ITS AFFILIATES, HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES
AND DISCHARGES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
OTHER PARTY AND ITS AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL LOSSES FOR ANY BREACH OR
FAILURE OF ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, OR BREACH OF ANY COVENANT IN THIS
AGREEMENT (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN,
MATURED OR UNMATURED, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ACCRUED OR NOT ACCRUED OR BASED ON
ANY LAW OR RIGHT OF ACTION OR OTHERWISE) NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEGLIGENCE OR
GROSS NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR
STRICT LIABILITY OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF A RELEASED PARTY.

(i) _Additional Remedy Matters_. To the extent any claim may be recoverable
pursuant to more than one Section of this _Article 8_ , the Indemnified Party
may make such claim under any such Section in the alternative; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement is intended to allow an
Indemnified Party to receive duplicative payments and to the extent an
Indemnified Party has been paid for any Loss under one Section of this
Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall not be permitted to seek payment for
that Loss under another Section of this Agreement.

9\. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Post-Closing Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed any Post-Closing Tax Returns with
respect to the Subject Entities and the Business Assets, as applicable, except
with respect to such Company Joint Venture Entities where the Buyer is not,
directly or indirectly, responsible for the preparation of Tax Returns
pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the applicable Company Joint
Venture Entity. The Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) any Post-Closing
Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of the Company Joint Venture
Entities the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the Buyers allocable share
of such Post-Closing Taxes.

(b) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Seller shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Pre-Closing Tax Returns with
respect to the Subject Entities and Business Assets, except with respect to
such Company Joint Venture Entities where the Seller is not, directly
or indirectly,

 



60  responsible for the preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to the
Organizational Documents of the applicable Company Joint Venture Entity.
Copies of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns will be provided to the Buyer as soon
as reasonably practical prior to filing. The Seller shall pay or cause to be
paid any Pre-Closing Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of the
Company Joint Venture Entities the Seller shall pay or cause to be paid the
Sellers allocable share of such Pre-Closing Taxes.

(c) _Straddle Periods_. The Buyer shall be responsible for Taxes of the
Subject Entities and Business Assets relating to the portion of any Straddle
Period occurring after the Closing Date. The Seller shall be responsible for
Taxes of the Subject Entities and Business Assets relating to the portion of
any Straddle Period occurring before and ending on the Closing Date. With
respect to any Straddle Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Seller or the Buyer shall elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
the applicable Tax period. Subject to _Section 9(e)_, if applicable Law
shall not permit the Closing Date to be the last day of a Tax period, then (i)
real or personal property Taxes with respect to the Business Assets shall be
allocated based on the number of days in the partial periods ending on the
Closing Date and beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) all other Taxes based
on or in respect of income shall be allocated based on the Tax computed on the
basis of the taxable income or loss attributable to the Subject Entities or
the Business Assets, as applicable, for each partial period as determined from
their books and records, and (iii) all other Taxes shall be allocated on the
basis of the actual activities or attributes of the Subject Entities or the
Business Assets, as applicable, for each partial period as determined from the
Subject Entities books and records.

 

(d) _Straddle Returns_. The Buyer shall prepare any Straddle Returns with
respect to the Subject Entities or the Business Assets, as applicable, except
with respect to such Company Joint Venture Entities where the Buyer is not,
directly or indirectly, responsible for the preparation of Tax Returns
pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the applicable Company Joint
Venture Entity. The Buyer shall deliver, at least 45 days prior to the due
date for filing such Straddle Return (including any extension) to the Seller a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax that the Seller owes, including the
allocation of taxable income or loss, if any, and Taxes under _Section 9(c)_
and _Section 9(e)_, and copies of such Straddle Return. The Seller shall have
the right to review such Straddle Returns and the allocation of taxable
income, if any, and liability for Taxes and to suggest to the Buyer any
reasonable changes to such Straddle Returns no later than 15 days prior to the
date for the filing of such Straddle Returns. The Seller and the Buyer agree
to consult and to attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a
result of the review of such Straddle Returns and allocation of taxable
income, if any, and liability for Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing
as promptly as possible of such Straddle Returns. Not later than five days
before the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle
Returns, the Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the Buyer an amount equal
to the Taxes as agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller as being owed by the
Seller. If the Buyer and the Seller cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed
by the Seller with respect to a Straddle Return, the Seller shall pay or cause
to be paid to the Buyer the amount of Taxes reasonably determined by the Buyer
to be owed by the Seller. Within ten days after such payment, the Seller and
the Buyer shall refer the matter to an independent "Big-Four" accounting firm
agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller to arbitrate the dispute. The Seller and
the Buyer shall equally share the fees and expenses of such accounting firm
and its determination as to the amounts owed by the Seller and the Buyer with
respect to a Straddle Return shall be binding on the Seller and the Buyer.
Within five days after the determination by such accounting firm, if
necessary, the appropriate Party shall pay the other Party any amount which is
determined by such accounting firm to be owed. The Seller shall be entitled to
reduce its obligations to pay Taxes with respect to a Straddle Return by the
amount of any estimated Taxes paid or caused to be paid by the Seller with
respect to such Taxes on or before the Closing Date.

 



61 (e) _Allocations_. With respect to the taxable year that includes the Closing
Date, the Seller shall be allocated, in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the applicable Company Joint Venture Entity in effect as of the
Closing, all items of income, loss, deduction and credit of the Company Joint
Venture Entity for the period prior to and including the Closing Date and the
Buyer shall be allocated all remaining items of income, loss, deduction, and
credit of the applicable Company Joint Venture Entity. More precisely, with
respect to the sale or deemed sale of a portion of the applicable Percentage
Interest in each applicable Company Joint Venture Entity pursuant to this
Agreement, the Buyer and the Seller agree to cause each Company Joint Venture
Entity (to the extent they have the Legal Right) to elect "the closing of the
books" method pursuant to the regulations of Section 706 of the Code.

(f) _Indemnification_. The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller against all
Taxes paid by the Seller or its Affiliates with respect to the Subject
Entities and the Business Assets, as applicable, for any Post-Closing Tax
Period and the portion of any Straddle Period occurring after the Closing
Date. The Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer against all Taxes of or with
respect to the Subject Entities and Business Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the portion of any Straddle Period occurring on or before the
Closing Date, except to the extent of Taxes that were reflected in the
determination of the Purchase Price, as set forth in the Closing Statement.
Any amount referenced in this _Article 9_ in respect of any Company Joint
Venture Entity shall be deemed to be a portion of such amount equal to the
Percentage Interest applicable thereto.

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(i) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Article 9_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.

(ii) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use their
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the other Party
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

(h) _Certain Taxes_. The Seller shall prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration or similar taxes and fees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Seller shall present to the Buyer such Tax Returns and other
documentation for the Buyers review and consent no later than ten days
before the due date of such Tax Returns and other documentation (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If required by
applicable Law, the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Notwithstanding
anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller shall pay any
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or similar taxes and
fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



62 (i) _Confidentiality_. Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall
be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or reports, refund claims, Tax audits, Tax claims
and Tax litigation, or as required by Law.

 

(j) _Audits_. The Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, shall provide prompt
written notice to the other Party of any pending or threatened Tax audit,
assessment or proceeding that it becomes aware of related to a Subject Entity
regarding the Business Assets for whole or partial periods for which it is
indemnified by the other Party hereunder. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any
notice or other document received from or with any Tax authority in respect of
any such matters. If an Indemnified Party has Knowledge of an asserted Tax
liability with respect to a matter for which it is to be indemnified hereunder
and such Party fails to give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of such
asserted Tax liability, then (i) if the Indemnifying Party is precluded by
the failure to give prompt notice from contesting the asserted Tax liability
in any forum, the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for any Taxes arising out of such asserted Tax liability
and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is not so precluded from contesting, but
such failure to give prompt notice results in a detriment to the Indemnifying
Party, then any amount which the Indemnifying Party is otherwise required to
pay the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9(j)_ shall be reduced
by the amount of such detriment, _provided_ , the Indemnified Party shall
nevertheless be entitled to full indemnification hereunder to the extent, and
only to the extent, that such Party can establish that the Indemnifying Party
was not prejudiced by such failure. This _Section 9(j)_ shall control the
procedure for Tax indemnification matters to the extent it is inconsistent
with any other provision of this Agreement.

(k) _Control of Proceedings_. The Party responsible for a Tax under this
Agreement shall control audits and disputes related to such Taxes (including
action taken to pay, compromise or settle such Taxes). The Seller and the
Buyer shall jointly control, in good faith with each other, audits and
disputes relating to Straddle Periods. Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses with
respect to such contests shall be borne by the Seller and the Buyer in
proportion to their responsibility for such Taxes as set forth in this
Agreement. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the
noncontrolling Party shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to
participate in such proceedings at its own expense.

(l) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Seller and the Buyer agree that they
will: (i) agree to a reasonable allocation of the Purchase Price no later than
90 days after the Effective Date; (ii) report the Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated hereby in a manner consistent with such allocation,
and in particular, report the information required by Section 1060(b) of the
Code on Form 8594 in a manner consistent with such allocation; and (iii) not
take any position inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax return,
in any refund claim, in any litigation, investigation or otherwise, unless
required by applicable Laws or with the prior written consent of the other
Party.

 

(m) _Closing Tax Certificate_. At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the
Buyer a Closing Tax Certificate with respect to each applicable transferor,
signed under penalties of perjury (i) stating that such transferor is not a
foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate,
(ii) providing its U.S. Employer Identification Number and (iii) providing
its address, all pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



63 (n) _Tax Refunds_. If the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer receives a
refund of any Taxes that the Seller is responsible for hereunder, or if the
Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller receives a refund of any Taxes that the
Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the Party receiving such refund shall,
within 30 days after receipt of such refund, remit it (less any costs and
expenses incurred in obtaining such refund) to the Party who has
responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. For the purpose of this _Section
9(n)_, the term "refund" shall include a reduction in Tax and the actual use
of an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset, and receipt of a refund
shall occur upon the filing of a Tax Return or an adjustment thereto using
such reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the receipt of cash. Each Party
shall promptly notify the other of any right to claim a refund with respect to
Taxes for which the other Party is liable pursuant to this Agreement and shall
reasonably cooperate (at the expense of the Party entitled to the refund
hereunder) in the claim of such refund or other process required to obtain
such refund.

10\. _Termination_.

Effect, (x) the Buyer has notified the Seller of the breach in the manner
provided for in _Section 11(k)_, (y) the breach has continued without cure

or breach of any representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, by giving written notice to the Buyer at any time

case of (A) the Seller at any time, (B) the Buyer at any time (with respect
to Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline
Company, L.L.C. and Poseidon) and (C) the Buyer after the Closing Date (with
respect to such Company Joint Venture Entities and all other Company Joint
Venture Entities to the extent a Percentage Interest is acquired hereunder by
the Buyer), to the extent it has the Legal Right, shall cause each Company
Joint Venture Entity to, treat and hold as such all of the other Partys
Confidential Information and refrain from using any of such Confidential
Information except in connection with this Agreement. If either Party or any
of the Subject Entities are ever requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any action) to disclose any of the
other Partys Confidential Information, the disclosing Party will notify the
other Party promptly of the request or requirement so that the other Party may
seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with this _Section
11(a)(ii)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, the disclosing Party or any of the Subject Entities, on the
written advice of counsel, are compelled to disclose any of the other Partys
Confidential Information to any Government Authority, arbitrator, or mediator
or else stand liable for contempt, then the disclosing Party or the applicable
Subject Entity may disclose such Confidential Information to the Government
Authority, arbitrator, or mediator; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
disclosing Party will use its

 



66  Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain (or to cause each Company and
Company Subsidiary and, to the extent it has the Legal Right, each Company
Joint Venture Entity to such Subject Entity to obtain), at the request of the
other Party, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of such Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as the other Party may designate. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing Date the Buyer, its Affiliates
and the Subject Entities shall not be prohibited from disclosing or using
Confidential Information related to the Business, the Subject Entities or the
Business Assets, and this _Section 11(a)(ii)_ shall not apply with respect
to any such Confidential Information.

(b) _Insurance_. 

(i) The Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to and, to the extent it
has the Legal Right, shall cause each Company Joint Venture Entity to, use
its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to file, notice, and otherwise continue to
pursue any Insurance Rights that the Buyer desires to pursue; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in this  _Section 11(b)_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be construed to limit the Sellers rights to cancel the
coverage(s) of any of the Insurance Policies in respect of any fact,
circumstance or event relating to the Business Assets or Business that occurs
or arises after the Closing.

(ii) The Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to and, to the extent it
has the Legal Right, shall cause each Company Joint Venture Entity to, file
all insured claims (both before and after Closing) that may be filed under any
Insurance Policy issued to it or its Affiliates and will thereafter coordinate
with the Buyer to resolve all of the Buyers claims relating to the Insurance
Rights.

(c) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement and
the Reimbursement Agreement, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on
the other hand, will each bear their own costs and expenses (including those
of Affiliates) incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including all fees and
expenses of agents, representatives, financial advisors, legal counsel and
accountants.

 

(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the indemnification provisions
and the provisions of _Section 11(r)_, this Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

(e) _Succession_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

(f) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple identical
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



67 (g) _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits, Schedules and
other attachments identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof. If there is any conflict or other
inconsistency between this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules, the terms
of this Agreement shall prevail. Subject to  _Section 11(p)_, to the extent
of any ambiguity, inconsistency or conflict between this Agreement and any
other Transaction Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.

 

(h) _Set off Rights_. Each Party will have the option of setting off all or
any part of any amounts, including damages, due it or its Affiliates under
any Transaction Agreement by notifying the other Party that such Party is
electing to set off the amount outstanding under this Agreement by such
amount. A Partys exercise, if in good faith, of its set off rights will
not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

(i) _Remedies_. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights, obligations
and remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any
other rights, obligations or remedies otherwise available at law or in equity.
Except as expressly provided herein, nothing herein will be considered
an election of remedies.

(j) _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

(k) _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing. Any notice, request, demand,

(l) _Governing Law; Venue; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(i) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF
LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF TEXAS OR ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF
ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF TEXAS; _PROVIDED , HOWEVER_, THAT
ALL REAL PROPERTY MATTERS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH SUCH PROPERTY IS LOCATED.

(ii) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO SUBMIT TO
THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMPETENT COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS (THE " _C
OURTS_") FOR ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (AND AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY
LITIGATION RELATING THERETO EXCEPT IN THE COURTS), WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION IN THE COURTS AND AGREES NOT TO
PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY COURT THAT SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT THEREIN HAS BEEN
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 



69 (iii) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY
OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY
THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO
SUCH PARTY AT THE ADDRESS OF SUCH PARTY SET FORTH IN OR DESIGNATED PURSUANT
TO _S ECTION 11(K)_ OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF TEXAS.

 

(iv) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

(m) _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Buyer and
the Seller. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

 

(n) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

 

(o) _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local,
or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
word "including" shall mean including without limitation. All personal
pronouns used in this Agreement, whether used in the masculine, feminine or
neuter gender, shall include all other genders; the singular shall include the
plural, and vice versa. All references herein to Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections or subdivisions thereof shall refer to the corresponding
Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections or subdivisions thereof of this
Agreement unless specific reference is made to such exhibits, schedules,
articles, sections or subdivisions of another document or instrument. The
terms "herein," "hereby," "hereunder," "hereof," "hereinafter," and other
equivalent words refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not solely to
the particular portion of the Agreement in which such word is used. The words
"shall" and "will" are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement and
shall accordingly be given the same meaning, regardless of which word is
used. Except to the extent expressly provided to the contrary,

 



70  references to a Party include its permitted successors and assigns. Each
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed a part
hereof, and any representation, warranty or covenant herein referenced or
affirmed in such certificate shall be treated as a representation, warranty or
covenant given in the correlated Section hereof on the date of such
certificate. Additionally, any representation, warranty or covenant made in
any such certificate shall be deemed to be made herein. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature
shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time.

 

(p) _Entire Agreement_. THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO
HEREIN) CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND SUPERSEDES ANY
UNDERSTANDINGS, AGREEMENTS, OR REPRESENTATIONS BY OR AMONG THE PARTIES (OTHER
THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND THE REIMBURSEMENT
AGREEMENT), WRITTEN OR ORAL, TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE RELATED IN ANY WAY TO
THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL CONTROL TO THE EXTENT
OF SUCH CONFLICT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TO THE EXTENT THE BUYER IS
REQUIRED TO PAY A FEE TO OR OTHERWISE REIMBURSE THE SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES
UNDER ANY PROVISION HEREOF AND THE BUYER ALSO AGREED TO PAY A FEE TO OR
OTHERWISE REIMBURSE THE SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES FOR THE SAME MATTERS UNDER
THE REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT, THE
REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT SHALL CONTROL AS TO MATTERS UNDER _S ECTIONS 5(K)_,
_5( O)_, _6( B)(I)_ OR _6( D)(IV)_ HEREOF AND THE TRANSITION SERVICES
AGREEMENT SHALL CONTROL WITH RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES (AS
DEFINED THEREIN) AND THE BUYER SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY A FEE TO
OR REIMBURSE THE SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES FOR SUCH COSTS OR EXPENSES UNDER
MORE THAN ONE AGREEMENT. UPON CLOSING, THE BUYER IS HEREBY RELEASED FROM ALL
OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

 

(q) _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Parties would be damaged irreparably if any provision of this Agreement is
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached.
Accordingly, and notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 11(l)_, each
Party agrees that the other Party will be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms and provisions in any action
instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter, in addition to any other
remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

(r) _No Recourse Against Non-Parties_.

(i) All claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, may be made only against the entities that are expressly
identified as Parties hereto. No Person who is not a named Party to this
Agreement, including any director, officer, employee, member, partner
(general or limited), securityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any named Party to this Agreement (" _Non-Party Affiliates_
"), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity
party against its owners or Affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities
arising under, in connection with 

 



71  or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each Party
hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations
against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly
intended as third-party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller agrees that
neither it, nor the Seller Group, shall have any claim against any Financing
Source, any lender participating in the Financing or any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, agents, Representatives, Affiliates, successors or
assigns (collectively, " _Finance Related Parties_ "), nor shall any Finance
Related Party have any liability whatsoever to the Seller Group, in connection
with the Financing or in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, in each case, whether arising, in whole or in part, out
of comparative, contributory or sole negligence by any Finance Related Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (a) no amendment
or modification to this _Section 11(r)(ii)_ (or amendment or modification
with respect to any related definitions as they affect this _Section
11(r)(ii)_) shall be effective without the prior written consent of each
Financing Source and (b) each Financing Source and Finance Related Party shall
be an express third party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce,
this  _Section 11(r)(ii)_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that, _Section
11(l)_ notwithstanding, this provision shall be interpreted, and any action
relating to this provision, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York and any legal action or proceeding relating to this _Section
11(r)(ii)_, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of New York located in the County of New York, the courts of the United
States of America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts
from any thereof. This _Section 11(r)(ii)_ is intended to benefit and may be
enforced by the Financing Sources and the Finance Related Parties.

(s) _Public Announcements_. Neither Party shall issue any press release or
make any public announcement or otherwise publicly disseminate information
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement before or after the Closing
without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, that_ (i)
either Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is
required by applicable Law or any listing or trading agreement or other
securities exchange requirement concerning its publicly traded securities,
including in the case of the Buyer in connection with a Financing, and (ii)
after the Closing, either Party may make disclosures of then-current public
information regarding this Agreement and the transactions effected hereunder;
_ provided further_ , that each Party hereby consents to, and agrees that no
consultation or prior consent shall be required for, the issuance by the other
Party or its Affiliates of the press releases attached hereto as _Exhibit G_
or any other disclosures of the type contained, or similar to the
disclosures, in such press releases. In the event a Party has approved or been
consulted with respect to any disclosures as required hereunder, the other
Party or its Affiliates shall be entitled to make disclosures substantially
similar (as to form and content) to those prior disclosures that the non-
disclosing Party has approved or

 



72  been consulted with respect to, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, but without limiting the
Buyers release from its confidentiality obligations under Section 11(a) and
the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing, the Buyer and any of its
Affiliates may, without the prior written consent of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, but after consultation with the Seller at least 24 hours in
advance (if before the Closing and including any consultation prior to the
date hereof), disclose the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any
information regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Business Assets, the Combined Financial Statements, if
applicable, and the Supplemental Combined Financial Statements and any related
financial information and such other information deemed necessary by the Buyer
or its Affiliates) in or in connection with (i) offering materials for a
Financing, and/or (ii) one or more customary investor presentations or related
conference calls by the Buyer and its Affiliates with investors or analysts.
