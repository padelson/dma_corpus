At the date of this Merger Protocol, Ziggo holds 1,806 Shares. 

|

| 
---|--- 

(L)

|

Liberty Global has presented its vision with respect to the combined
businesses to the Boards (as defined below) on 23 January 2014. 

| 
---|--- 

(M)

|

The management board (raad van bestuur) of Ziggo (the Management Board) and
the supervisory board (raad van commissarissen) of Ziggo (the Supervisory
Board) (together the Boards) have in connection with the Offer received
fairness opinions (the Management Board from J.P. Morgan Limited and Perella
Weinberg Partners UK LLP and the Supervisory Board from ABN AMRO Bank N.V.) to
the effect that, as of the date of this Merger Protocol, the Offer Price is
fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares (other than BidCo
and its Affiliates and Ziggo), and the purchase price for the entire Ziggo
business under the Asset Sale is fair from a financial point of view to Ziggo,
in each case in form and substance satisfactory to the Boards and in support
of their recommendation of the Offer. 

| 
---|--- 

(N)

|

The Boards have approved the terms of this Merger Protocol and intend to
unanimously recommend the Offer for acceptance by the holders of Shares,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Merger Protocol. 

| 
---|--- 

(O)

|

The Parties have discussed and agreed the manner and timing of (i) disclosure
of the Merger and (ii) communications with the relevant authorities and
employee representatives. The notification and consultation procedure with
respect to the Offer pursuant to the SER Fusiegedragsregels 2000 (the Dutch
code in respect of informing and consulting of trade unions), the Dutch Works
Council Act (Wet op de Ondernemingsraden; the WOR) and any other similar laws
and regulations of any jurisdiction other than the Netherlands have been
initiated or will be initiated immediately after execution of this Merger
Protocol. 

| 
---|---

|

BidCo undertakes to Ziggo to prepare and make or designate a wholly-owned

settle the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this
Merger Protocol. 

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Offer will be completed as soon as possible following the date of this
Merger Protocol, subject to the terms and conditions of this Merger Protocol. 

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

The Parties shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including
without limitation, the applicable provisions of the Dutch Act on Financial
Supervision (Wet op het Financieel Toezicht; the Wft), the Decree on Public
Takeovers (Besluit Openbare Biedingen; the Decree), the rules and regulations

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

The Parties will co-operate in ensuring that all filings and notices required
by the Applicable Rules, or as otherwise required by the AFM, Euronext

Offer Price

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Provided that this Merger Protocol is not terminated pursuant to Clause 22 and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Commencement Conditions and the
Offer Conditions, the Offer shall commit BidCo to acquire each Share validly
tendered under the Offer and not withdrawn for a consideration per Share
consisting of: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

0.2282 of a Liberty Global A Share (the Class A Exchange Ratio) and 0.1674 of
a Liberty Global C Share (the Class C Exchange Ratio, and together the Share
Consideration); and 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

6 

| | 
---|--- 

(b)

|

an amount of €11.- in cash (the Cash Consideration and, together with the
Share Consideration, the Offer Price). 

| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

Ziggo will not declare or pay any (interim) dividend or make or agree to make
any distribution in kind, whether from capital, profits or reserves in the
period between the date of this Merger Protocol and the earlier of the
Settlement Date and the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of
this Merger Protocol (the Long Stop Date). In the event Ziggo does not comply
with its obligation in the previous sentence, BidCo may, in addition to any
other remedies available to it, reduce the Cash Consideration accordingly. 

| 
---|--- 

2.7

|

The Offer Price will be adjusted for any dividends or other distributions by
Liberty Global during the period until Settlement, as detailed in Schedule 3
and Schedule 12. 

| 
---|--- 

2.8

|

In connection with the Offer, BidCo will only deliver whole Liberty Global
shares. To the extent holders of the Shares would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional Liberty Global share as a result of the application of the exchange
ratio of the Share Consideration, each such holder shall receive instead of a
fractional Liberty Global share an amount in cash (in euro, rounded down to
the nearest eurocent) equal to the product of the fraction of the Liberty
Global share it would be entitled to receive and the price (net of related
fees and expenses) at which such shareholder\'s tendering admitted institution
on Euronext Amsterdam or Euroclear Netherlands sells the entitlements to the
Liberty Global Shares on the third Business Day preceding the Settlement Date.
BidCo may include in the Offer Memorandum another settlement mechanism that is
appropriate for shares in companies listed on NASDAQ or as may be proposed by
the Settlement Agent. 

Initial Announcement

| 
---|--- 

2.9

|

The execution of this Merger Protocol will be announced immediately following
its execution and in any event prior to the opening of the first trading day
on Euronext Amsterdam following the execution of this Merger Protocol by way
of a press release issued jointly by the Liberty Global Group and Ziggo (the
Initial Announcement). The AFM and Euronext Amsterdam will be provided with a
copy of the Initial Announcement immediately upon its release, and NASDAQ will
be provided with a copy of the Initial Announcement at least 30 minutes prior
to its release. The relevant (international) press-agents, the Socio-Economic
Council (Sociaal-Economische Raad), the relevant Dutch trade unions, and the
Works Council will also receive a copy. A copy of the Initial Announcement is
attached hereto as Schedule 2. 

| 
---|--- 

2.10

|

BidCo will make the certain funds announcement in relation to the Offer as
required by article 7 paragraph 4 of the Decree in the Initial Announcement. 

Offer Memorandum and Position Statement

| 
---|--- 

2.11

|

BidCo shall prepare the offer memorandum (biedingsbericht) (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the Offer Memorandum) and file the Offer
Memorandum with the AFM for approval as soon as reasonably possible and in any
event within the applicable timetable pursuant to the Decree. 

| 
---|--- 

2.12

|

The Offer Memorandum (and all transactions contemplated thereby) shall comply
as to form and substance in all respects with the Applicable Rules. BidCo will
draft the Offer Memorandum and give Ziggo sufficient opportunity to review,
comment upon and, for any sections solely relating to and being under the sole
responsibility of Ziggo, approve the Offer Memorandum (which approval shall
not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). Ziggo, acting reasonably, undertakes
to timely provide all such 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

7 

| information and data relating to Ziggo and the Ziggo Group as may reasonably
be requested by BidCo to be included in the Offer Memorandum or as may be
otherwise required by the Applicable Rules.

| 
---|--- 

2.13

|

The Offer Memorandum shall contain one or more provisions to the effect that
those shareholders of Ziggo tendering Shares under the Offer automatically
cease to have and - by tendering their Shares under the Offer - waive any and
all rights or entitlements they may have in their capacity as shareholders of
Ziggo or otherwise in connection with their shareholding in Ziggo vis-a-vis
any member of the Ziggo Group and all the supervisory and management board
members of the companies mentioned in this paragraph. 

| 
---|--- 

2.14

|

As soon as reasonably possible after the date hereof (and in any event no
later than the Commencement Date), BidCo will file a registration statement on
Form S-4 with the SEC for the purpose of registering the securities issued as
part of the Share Consideration with the SEC (this registration statement,
including without limitation any pre- or post-effective amendment thereto or
any prospectus or prospectus supplement in respect thereof, the Registration
Statement). BidCo and Liberty Global will use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Registration Statement shall have been declared effective by
the SEC under the Securities Act and that the Liberty Global A Shares and
Liberty Global C Shares to be issued as part of the Share Consideration will
have been approved for listing on NASDAQ in each case prior to the Closing
Date. If, for any reason (other than a breach by Ziggo of its obligations
hereunder), the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC
under the Securities Act and/or the Liberty Global A Shares and Liberty Global
C Shares to be issued as part of the Share Consideration have not been
approved for listing on NASDAQ prior to the Closing Date, this will constitute
a material breach by BidCo for purposes of this Merger Protocol entitling
Ziggo to terminate this Merger Protocol and receive the termination fee under
Clause 23.3(a). 

| 
---|--- 

2.15

|

Ziggo will prepare the position statement pursuant to article 18 of the Decree
(the Position Statement), which shall be consistent with this Merger Protocol,
shall comply as to form and substance in all respects with the Applicable
Rules and may include such additional information as Ziggo reasonably
determines should be included therein. Ziggo will give BidCo sufficient
opportunity to review and comment on and, for any sections solely relating to
BidCo or Liberty Global, approve the Position Statement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.16

|

If Works Council Clearance is obtained prior to the Commencement Date, Ziggo
will issue the Position Statement concurrently with the publication of the
Offer Memorandum to holders of Shares. In the event that Works Council
Clearance is not obtained prior to the Commencement Date, Ziggo will postpone
the issuance of the Position Statement until such later time that (i) Works
Council Clearance is obtained; or (ii) the Works Council renders a negative
advice (which is deemed to include an advice with conditions not reasonably
acceptable to Ziggo, and the case where the Works Council does not render
advice within a reasonable period of time) and either (a) the Works Council
has unconditionally and irrevocably waived its right to initiate the legal
proceedings set out in section 26 of the WOR in writing; or (b) the applicable
waiting period pursuant to section 25 paragraph 6 of the WOR has expired
without the Works Council having initiated legal proceedings as set out in the
WOR; or (c) following the initiation of legal proceedings as set out in
section 26 of the WOR, Ziggo is reasonably comfortable that the Enterprise
Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (Ondernemingskamer) will dismiss the
Works Council\'s claims. 

| 
---|--- 

2.17

|

Ziggo will in any event issue the Position Statement four (4) Business Days
prior to the EGM in accordance with article 18 paragraph 2 of the Decree. If
Ziggo does not issue the Position Statement concurrently with the publication
of the Offer Memorandum as per Clause 2.16, then it will issue a press release
reconfirming its intent to issue the Recommendation upon and subject only to
completion of the process set out in the first sentence of this Clause. 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

8 

| | 
---|--- 

2.18

|

Both the Offer Memorandum and the Position Statement shall set forth the
Recommendation referred to in Clause 3.1(b). The Fairness Opinions referred to
in Clause 3.5 will be included in the Position Statement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.19

|

The arrangements and agreements set out in this Merger Protocol shall be
included in comprehensive summary form in the Initial Announcement and in the
Offer Memorandum, with the exception of the Non-Financial Covenants (as
defined in Clause 13.1) which shall be included in full in the Offer
Memorandum. 

| 
---|--- 

2.20

|

Each Party will provide all information as may reasonably be required by the
other Parties to ensure that the Offer Memorandum, the Position Statement and
the Registration Statement (i) do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) are in
compliance with all Applicable Rules in all material respects. Each Party
shall be responsible for the information provided by it. 

Offer Period

| 
---|--- 

2.21

|

BidCo shall make the Offer (bod uitbrengen) no later than on the Ultimate
Launch Date, subject to all Commencement Conditions being satisfied or waived
by BidCo and/or Ziggo, as the case may be, by making the Offer Memorandum
generally available in the Netherlands and in those other jurisdictions in
which the Parties agree or are obliged to make the Offer pursuant to the
Applicable Rules (the date on which the Offer is made, the Commencement Date).
BidCo and Ziggo shall jointly announce the availability of the Offer
Memorandum and shall disseminate the Offer Memorandum in the jurisdictions
where the Offer is made in accordance with the Applicable Rules. 

| 
---|--- 

2.22

|

BidCo may, in its sole discretion, determine the duration of the acceptance
period (aanmeldingstermijn) of the Offer (the Offer Period), provided that the
initial Offer Period shall be no less than eight (8) weeks and no longer than
ten (10) weeks (the last day of the Offer Period hereinafter the Closing
Date). 

| 
---|--- 

2.23

|

Immediately prior to the Commencement Date, Ziggo must provide a written
confirmation to BidCo that, to the best knowledge of the members of the
Management Board, after having made reasonable enquiries, the Commencement
Conditions set forth in Clause 4.1(b) (no breach by Ziggo) and Clause 4.1(i)
(no breach of public offer regulations) have been satisfied (or not, in which
case reasonable details as to the non-satisfaction shall be included in the
written confirmation) as of that time. Immediately prior to the expiration of
the Offer Period, Ziggo must provide the same confirmation with regard to the
Offer Conditions set forth in Clause 4.5(d) (no breach by Ziggo) and Clause
4.5(k) (no breach of public offer regulations). 

| 
---|--- 

2.24

|

Immediately prior to the Commencement Date, BidCo must provide a written
confirmation to Ziggo that, to the best knowledge of the members of its board,
after having made reasonable enquiries, the Commencement Conditions set forth
in Clause 4.1(c) (no breach by Liberty Global or BidCo) and Clause 4.1(i) (no
breach of public offer regulations) have been satisfied (or not, in which case
reasonable details as to the non-satisfaction shall be included in the written
confirmation) as of that time. Immediately prior to the expiration of the
Offer Period, BidCo must provide the same confirmation with regard to the
Offer Conditions set forth in Clause 4.5(e) (no breach by Liberty Global or
BidCo) and Clause 4.5(k) (no breach of public offer regulations). 

| 
---|--- 

2.25

|

If any Offer Condition is not satisfied or waived on the initial Closing Date,
BidCo may, subject to prior consultation with Ziggo, extend the Offer Period
once, provided that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

such extension of the Offer Period shall be no less than two (2) weeks and no
more than ten (10) weeks after the initial Closing Date; and 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

9 

| | 
---|--- 

(b)

|

if the Offer Condition relating to Competition Clearance set out in Clause
4.5(b) is not satisfied or waived on the Closing Date, BidCo must extend the
Offer Period for one or more periods of time (subject to, in respect of an
extension by more than one period, receipt of an exemption granted by the AFM,
to be requested by BidCo) until such time as the Parties reasonably believe is
necessary to cause such Offer Condition to be satisfied. 

Ziggo shall support and cooperate with BidCo\'s request to the AFM for an
exemption to extend the Offer Period more than once.

If, at any point in time prior to the Long Stop Date (i) the AFM does not
grant an exemption to extend the Offer Period as a consequence of which the
Offer Period has lapsed without the Offer having been declared unconditional
(gestand gedaan) and (ii) the Offer Condition relating to Competition
Clearance set out in Clause 4.5(b) is not yet satisfied or waived, but no
decision has yet been made or deemed to have been made by the Antitrust
Authorities in respect of Phase II Competition Clearance, BidCo will promptly
request the AFM to be granted an exemption enabling it to immediately launch a
new public offer on the same terms and conditions as the Offer (and such new
offer will then be deemed to be the "Offer" for purposes of this Merger
Protocol) with an offer period not expiring beyond the Long Stop Date.

In case of one or more extensions of the Offer Period, all references to the
Closing Date shall, unless the context requires otherwise, be deemed to refer
to the latest date and time to which the Offer Period has been so extended.

| 
---|--- 

2.26

|

If the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Merger Protocol, BidCo must publicly declare the Offer unconditional no later
than the third (3rd) Business Day after the Closing Date (the Unconditional
Date). Transfer of the Shares tendered under the Offer against payment of the
Offer Price (the Settlement) is expected to occur at the latest on the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the Unconditional Date (the Settlement Date). 

| 
---|--- 

2.27

|

RECOMMENDATION AND SUPPORT 

| 
---|--- 

3.1

|

On the basis that the Offer, the Merger and the related actions as
contemplated in this Merger Protocol are in the best interest of Ziggo and its
stakeholders (including its shareholders), Ziggo confirms that: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Boards have unanimously approved and consented to the entering into by
Ziggo of this Merger Protocol, the Asset Sale and Liquidation and execution
and performance of Ziggo\'s obligation thereunder and confirm that no other
internal approval is necessary, except for (i) the adoption of the Asset Sale
and Liquidation Resolutions and (ii) a resolution of the Boards with respect
to the Asset Sale and Liquidation in the event that BidCo and its Affiliates,
alone or together with Ziggo, shall hold less than 80% of the Shares
immediately after settlement of all the Shares tendered in the Post Acceptance
Period; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the Boards have duly considered the Offer and shall, subject to Clause 3.3,
unanimously support and unanimously recommend the Offer for acceptance to
holders of Shares in the Initial 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

10 

| Announcement, any further press releases in connection with the Offer, the
Offer Memorandum and the Position Statement, and shall unanimously recommend
the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions at the EGM (the
Recommendation);

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

subject to Clause 3.3, neither the Boards nor any of their members shall
revoke or modify, amend or qualify their respective recommendation nor make
any public contradictory statements as to their position with respect to the
Offer nor for the avoidance of doubt fail to announce or reaffirm their
Recommendation 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

the Boards have resolved that Ziggo will take all necessary actions within its
power to effect the Merger. 

| 
---|--- 

3.2

|

Except if the Boards publicly reaffirm their Recommendation upon BidCo\'s
request, any action by any member of the Boards in deviation from or
inconsistent with the Recommendation which could cause uncertainty as to the
status of the Recommendation will constitute a material breach by Ziggo for
purposes of this Merger Protocol entitling BidCo to terminate this Merger
Protocol and, subject to Clause 23.2, receive the termination fee under Clause
23.1, subject to Clause 3.2. 

| 
---|--- 

3.3

|

The Boards, acting jointly, may revoke, modify, amend or qualify the
Recommendation if there shall have been any material event, development,
circumstance or change in circumstances or facts (including any material
change in probability or magnitude of circumstances) which first occurred (or
of which the Boards became first aware) after the date hereof, which was not
foreseen by the Boards, and they determine, acting in good faith and having
consulted their financial and legal advisers, that failure to do so would be a
breach of their fiduciary duties under Dutch law, it being understood that, in
making their determination to revoke, modify, amend or qualify the
Recommendation, the Boards will ignore: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any Alternative Proposal, except if they determine it to be a Competing Offer
pursuant to and in accordance with Clause 21, and Clause 21.5(d) applies; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

any depreciation in value of the Liberty Global A Shares and the Liberty
Global C Shares, except to the extent that any such depreciation in value
constitutes a Liberty Global Stock Event pursuant to and in accordance with
Schedule 11, and Clause 23.2 applies. 

| 
---|--- 

3.4

|

If the Boards withdraw their Recommendation pursuant to Clause 3.3 and BidCo
continues with the Offer, Ziggo, the Boards and each of their members
individually shall, subject to the terms of the Asset Sale agreement referred
to in Clause 7.3, continue to cooperate with the Merger if BidCo and its
Affiliates, alone or together with Ziggo, immediately after settlement of all
the Shares tendered in the Post Acceptance Period hold at least 80% of
Ziggo\'s aggregate issued and outstanding ordinary share capital (geplaatst en
uitstaand kapitaal) (excluding any Shares then held by Ziggo) on a fully
diluted basis. 

| 
---|--- 

3.5

|

The Boards have obtained, inter alia, the opinions, addressed to the
Management Board by J.P. Morgan Limited and Perella Weinberg Partners UK LLP
and to the Supervisory Board by ABN AMRO Bank N.V., in each case, to the
effect that, as of the date of this Merger Protocol, the Offer Price is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Shares (other than BidCo,
its Affiliates and Ziggo) and the purchase price for the entire Ziggo business
under the Asset Sale is fair from a financial point of view to Ziggo (such
opinions hereinafter: the Fairness Opinions).

---|--- 

4.13

|

If Ziggo has sent a Notice of Disagreement to BidCo in accordance with Clause

responding to the arguments raised by Ziggo in its Notice of Disagreement (a
Counter-Notice of Disagreement). 

| 
---|--- 

4.14

|

Either Party shall be entitled upon lapse of three (3) Business Days from the

to the other Parties, to a binding advisor (Binding Advisor) who shall settle
the matter by way of binding advice (bindend advies) (Binding Advice) under

|

FINANCING 

| 
---|--- 

5.1

|

Following the Initial Announcement, Ziggo shall implement the refinancing plan
set out in Schedule 5. 

| 
---|--- 

5.2

|

At the Settlement Date, following completion of the refinancing steps set out
in Schedule 5, BidCo anticipates that Ziggo will have a total debt divided by
last two quarters annualized end of December 2013 EBITDA ratio (on a synergy
adjusted basis, including a maximum of 50% of the attributable Opex synergies)
of approximately 5.0x. The Offer Definitive Financing Agreements entered into
pursuant to Schedule 5 contain a covenant restriction requiring Ziggo to
maintain a 5.5x ratio for total net debt divided by last two quarters
annualized EBITDA (on a synergy adjusted basis, including a maximum of 50% of
the attributable Opex synergies) for every quarter. 

| 
---|--- 

5.3

|

BidCo agrees, subject to Clause 5.4 below, that during the Restricted Period,
it will not make distributions of profit or capital to shareholders and not to
initiate or pursue a financial restructuring if, and to the extent, such
distributions or such restructuring result in a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of
the Joint Dutch Operations exceeding 5.5x when tested on the notional total
net debt of the Joint Dutch Operations on a pro forma basis across both
businesses. 

| 
---|--- 

5.4

|

If at any time during the Restricted Period, BidCo has breached Clause 5.3 (a
Covenant Event), then BidCo undertakes to remedy such breach within 12 months. 

| 
---|--- 

5.5

|

BidCo undertakes to set up a financial framework, including sufficient levels
of cash, that supports the realization of the Dutch Business Strategy. The
Joint Dutch Operations will continue to be a state of the art media and
communications service provider (in terms of core values, quality,
infrastructure, technology, commercial services amongst other things). BidCo
will respect the Ziggo Group\'s commitment to invest in its networks and
services in the Netherlands at a level which, in terms of quality and service
levels, is consistent with Ziggo\'s current operational business plans. 

| 
---|--- 

5.6

|

In line with statements made in Liberty Global\'s public filings, it is
Liberty Global\'s current policy to seek to maintain a consolidated group debt
balance that is between four and five times its consolidated group operating
cash flow, although no commitment can be given that this policy will not be
changed in the future. 

| 
---|--- 

5.7

|

For purposes of this Clause 5, 

| 
---|--- 

5.8

|

Consolidated Leverage Ratio shall have the meaning given to it in the Offer
Definitive Financing Agreements (in summary, this term refers to a ratio for
total net debt divided by the last two quarters\' annualised EBITDA, on a
synergy-adjusted basis, for every quarter and excludes inter-company debt); 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Restricted Period means the date commencing on the Settlement Date and ending
on the Covenant Long Stop Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Covenant Long Stop Date means the date falling two years after the Settlement
Date, or, in case of a Covenant Event during the second year of such two year
period, the earlier of (i) the date falling 12 months after the relevant
Covenant Event and (ii) the date on which the relevant Covenant Event has been
remedied.

Management Board, their (vote in favour of any) resignation from the

Management Board as determined in accordance with Clause 6.7, will resign from
his or her position as member of the Management Board as per the Settlement
Date (or such later date as will be agreed with BidCo) and each such member
will confirm that he or she has no claim whatsoever against Ziggo in respect
of loss of office or otherwise, other than his or her contractual redundancy
or termination entitlement in the amount as agreed prior to the date of this
Merger Protocol but only to the extent disclosed in the Liberty Global Pre-
Announcement Due Diligence. BidCo shall allow Ziggo to pay such compensation
to the respective members of the Management Board. BidCo will procure that any
resigning member of the Management Board is fully released from any duties in
respect of his or her position as member of the Management Board as per the
date of resignation and that such member will be granted full and final
discharge and release from any and all liabilities in respect of his or her
position as (former) member of the Management Board, provided that by the time
of such resignation, no fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct or criminal
behaviour of such member has become apparent.

POST-CLOSING RESTRUCTURING 

Delisting

| 
---|--- 

7.1

|

As soon as possible after completion of the Offer, the Parties will seek to: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

procure the delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam and the
termination of the listing agreement between Ziggo and Euronext Amsterdam in
relation to the listing of the Shares; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

have BidCo, or any of its Affiliates, acquire all Shares not yet owned by it
and cause Ziggo to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary within the Liberty
Global Group. 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

18 

| As long as it remains listed on Euronext Amsterdam, Ziggo shall continue to
comply with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (except for (i) current and
future deviations from the aforementioned code in accordance with the
"explain" requirement in respect of such deviations, (ii) deviations from the
aforementioned code that find their basis in this Merger Protocol, it being
understood that deviation from the best practices in respect of conflict of
interest as set out in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code shall not be
permitted).

Statutory squeeze-out proceedings

| 
---|--- 

7.2

|

If, following the Settlement Date and the Post Acceptance Period, BidCo and
its Affiliates, alone or together with Ziggo, hold at least 95% of the Shares,
BidCo will commence a compulsory acquisition procedure (uitkoopprocedure) in
accordance with article 2:92a or 2:201a of the DCC or the takeover buy-out
procedure in accordance with article 2:359c of the DCC to buy out the holders
of Shares that have not tendered their Shares under the Offer. Ziggo shall
provide BidCo with any assistance as may be required, including, if needed,
joining such proceedings as co-claimant. 

Asset Sale and Liquidation

| 
---|--- 

7.3

|

Ziggo acknowledges that BidCo\'s willingness to pay the Offer Price and pursue
the Merger is predicated on the acquisition of 100% of the Shares. The Parties
anticipate that full integration of Ziggo and the Dutch Liberty Global
Business will deliver substantial operational, commercial, organizational,
financial and tax benefits as further described in Schedule 6. Such benefits
could not, or only partially, be achieved if Ziggo were to continue as a
standalone entity with a minority shareholder base. Therefore, and subject
only to (i) the number of Shares having been tendered for acceptance during
the Offer Period and the Post Acceptance Period, together with (x) any Shares
directly or indirectly held by BidCo or any of its Affiliates, (y) any Shares
committed to BidCo or any of its Affiliates, in writing and (z) any Shares to
which BidCo is entitled representing less than 95% but at least 80% of
Ziggo\'s aggregate issued and outstanding ordinary share capital (geplaatst en
uitstaand kapitaal) (excluding any Shares then held by Ziggo) and (ii) the
Asset Sale and Liquidation Resolutions set out in Clause 16.2 having been
adopted, the Parties have, subject to the terms of the Asset Sale agreement
referred to below, agreed to a restructuring of the Combined Group in order to
ensure full integration of the businesses of Ziggo and Liberty Global, as set
out in more detail in Schedule 6 (the Asset Sale and Liquidation). In such
case, Parties will as soon as possible after the EGM, enter into the asset
sale agreement on BidCo\'s request in conformity with the draft attached as
Schedule 7 (the Asset Sale), and perform their respective obligations
thereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

7.4

|

In the event that BidCo and its Affiliates, alone or together with Ziggo,
shall hold less than 80% of Ziggo\'s aggregate issued and outstanding ordinary
share capital (geplaatst en uitstaand kapitaal) (excluding any Shares then
held by Ziggo) immediately after settlement of all the Shares tendered in the
Post Acceptance Period, the Boards shall have the right to re-evaluate the
Asset Sale and Liquidation in light of the then prevailing circumstances and
the Boards and the individual members of the Boards shall no longer be under
the obligation to cooperate with the Asset Sale and Liquidation. 

| 
---|--- 

7.5

|

BidCo hereby undertakes to indemnify and hold harmless, by way of irrevocable
third party stipulation for no consideration, each current and future member
of the Boards (each of them an Indemnified Party) against any damages,
liabilities, losses, costs (including reasonable adviser fees) and fines
(collectively Losses) actually incurred by such Indemnified Party in that
capacity arising directly or indirectly from the Asset Sale and Liquidation
and any acts or omissions in connection with preparing, proposing or
implementing the Asset Sale and Liquidation, in each case: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

excluding any Losses arising, accruing or incurred as a result of a breach of
his obligations under this Merger Protocol or the asset sale agreement, as
referred to in Clause 7.3, or fraud 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

19 

| by such Indemnified Party, as finally established by a court decision or
settlement agreement; and

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

except to the extent covered by insurance and actually paid out pursuant to
any insurance taken out for the benefit of an Indemnified Party; and 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

excluding any Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party in his or her capacity
as a holder of Shares, including without limitation any withholding taxes and
other taxes on any liquidation distributions to such Indemnified Party as part
of the Liquidation, 

provided that the Indemnified Party will not take any action that may
prejudice or affect his or her or BidCo\'s position in litigation without
BidCo\'s consent.

| 
---|--- 

7.6

|

BidCo will have sole control over any litigation relating to any Losses for
which the Indemnified Party is seeking to be indemnified hereunder, including
over any correspondence, negotiations and other communications with third
parties that could potentially result in litigation. If so requested, BidCo
shall keep the Indemnified Party properly informed and provide the Indemnified
Party the opportunity to review and comment upon any correspondence,
negotiations and other communications by BidCo with third parties. 

| 
---|--- 

7.7

|

Ziggo will procure that a DandO insurance policy is maintained (including
coverage for claims from Shareholders) for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties providing for run-off cover for a period of up to five years after the
Asset Sale and Liquidation, which policy provides in all other respects
substantially equivalent cover as Ziggo\'s DandO insurance policy in force as at
the date of this Merger Protocol. 

Other Post-Closing Measures

| 
---|--- 

7.8

|

If BidCo declares the Offer unconditional, then it shall be entitled to effect
or cause to effect any other restructuring of the Ziggo Group for the purpose
of achieving an optimal operational, legal, financial and/or fiscal structure
in accordance with the Merger Rules and Dutch law in general, some of which
may have the (side) effect of diluting the shareholding of any remaining
minority shareholders of Ziggo (Post-Closing Measures), including: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

a sale of all, or substantially all, of the assets and liabilities of Ziggo to
BidCo or an Affiliate of BidCo; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

a subsequent public offer for any Shares held by minority shareholders; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

a statutory cross-border or domestic (bilateral or triangular) legal merger
(juridische (driehoeks-)fusie) in accordance with article 2:309 et seq of the
DCC between Ziggo, BidCo, the Dutch Liberty Global Business and/or any other
Affiliate of BidCo; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

a statutory legal demerger (juridische splitsing) of Ziggo in accordance with
article 2:334a et seq of the DCC; 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

a contribution of cash and/or assets by BidCo or by any Affiliate of BidCo in
exchange for ordinary shares or preference shares in Ziggo\'s share capital,
in which circumstances the pre-emptive rights (voorkeursrechten), if any, of
minority shareholders of Ziggo may be excluded; 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

a distribution of proceeds, cash and/or assets to the shareholders of Ziggo or
share buybacks; 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

20 

| | 
---|--- 

(g)

|

a sale and transfer of assets and liabilities by BidCo or any of its
Affiliates to any member of the Ziggo Group, or a sale and transfer of assets
and liabilities by any member of the Ziggo Group to BidCo or any of its
Affiliates; 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

the conversion of Ziggo into a private company with limited liability
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid); 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

any transaction between Ziggo and BidCo or their respective Affiliates at
terms that are not at arm\'s length; 

| 
---|--- 

(j)

|

any transaction, including a sale and/or transfer of any material asset,
between Ziggo and its Affiliates or between Ziggo and BidCo or their
respective Affiliates with the objective of utilising any carry forward tax
losses available to Ziggo, BidCo or any of their respective Affiliates; 

| 
---|--- 

(k)

|

any combination of the foregoing; or 

| 
---|--- 

(l)

|

any transactions, restructurings, share issues, procedures and/or proceedings
in relation to Ziggo and/or one or more of its Affiliates required to effect
the aforementioned objectives. 

| 
---|--- 

7.9

|

In the implementation of any Post-Closing Measure, due consideration will be
given to the requirements of Dutch law and Applicable Rules, including the
requirement to consider the interests of all stakeholders including any
minority shareholders of Ziggo, and the requirement for the members of the
Supervisory Board to form their independent view of the relevant matter. In
this respect, the Supervisory Board shall continue to have the right to
engage, for the account of Ziggo, their own financial and legal advisors, if
and to the extent they believe that the advice of such advisors is necessary
to assist them in reviewing and assessing any matter that comes before the
Supervisory Board. 

| 
---|--- 

7.10

|

If any proposed Post-Closing Measure could reasonably be expected to lead to a
dilution of the shareholdings of the remaining minority shareholders in Ziggo,
other than pursuant to a rights issue or any other share issue where they have
been offered a reasonable opportunity to subscribe pro rata to their then
existing shareholding, or any shares issued to a third party not being an
Affiliate of a Party, a compulsory acquisition procedure (uitkoopprocedure) in
accordance with article 2:92a or 2:201a of the DCC or the takeover buy-out
procedure in accordance with article 2:359c of the DCC, or any other form of
unequal treatment which could prejudice or negatively affect the value of the
Shares held by the remaining minority shareholders or their reasonable
interests, then the affirmative vote of at least one Continuing Member shall
be required prior to the implementation of any such Post-Closing Measure. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

STRATEGY 

| 
---|--- 

8.1

|

The joint strategy underpinning the business rationale of the Merger (the
Dutch Business Strategy) will focus, amongst others, on: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

serving a large retail customer base in the fields of information,
communication and entertainment, offering digital television, broadband
internet and telephony; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

serving business markets and business to business, offering telephony, data
communications and electronic payment systems; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

development of the current product offering to new solutions, including mobile
functionality and convergence; 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

21 

| | 
---|--- 

(d)

|

realising maximum synergies and cost efficiencies by combining certain
business operations of the Parties; and 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

aligning with Liberty Global\'s long term strategy, which includes as one of
its core pillars the delivery of organic growth through continued innovation
and a commitment to ongoing investment. 

| 
---|--- 

8.2

|

BidCo shall support Ziggo and, after the Settlement Date, the Joint Dutch
Operations, as the case may be, with the pursuit of their realisation of the
Dutch Business Strategy. 

| 
---|--- 

8.3

|

The Ziggo Group or the Joint Dutch Operations, as the case may be, will
continue to be a state-of-the-art media and communications services provider
(in terms of core values, quality, infrastructure, technology, commercial
services among other things) in the Netherlands and the Joint Dutch Operations
will retain their material licences (including its operating licences) and
will continue to fulfil the conditions necessary to maintain such licences. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

ORGANISATION 

| 
---|--- 

9.1

|

As soon as possible after Settlement Date, the Ziggo Group and the Dutch
Liberty Global Business will be managed by a single management team which will
maintain the following organisational and commercial principles and
arrangements. 

| 
---|--- 

9.2

|

The composition of the management board and the management team of the Joint
Dutch Operations will be identical to the Management Board and the management
team of Ziggo as determined in accordance with the terms of this Merger
Protocol. 

| 
---|--- 

9.3

|

Following the Settlement Date, Ziggo will adopt the mitigated large company
regime (gemitigeerd structuurregime). If Ziggo ceases to exist after a
corporate restructuring (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a transfer of
the Z business to Liberty Global or any of its Affiliates) or a holding
company is interposed above both the Ziggo and the Dutch Liberty Global
Business, the mitigated large company regime (gemitigeerd structuurregime)
shall be established at the holding level of the Joint Dutch Operations. Ziggo
or such holding company or successor company where the mitigated large company
regime applies shall therefore continue to have a supervisory board, whereby
one-third of the supervisory board members shall be appointed on the basis of
a nomination made by the Works Council, and otherwise the composition of such
supervisory board will be in accordance with Clauses 6.1 up to and including
6.5. 

| 
---|--- 

9.4

|

Ziggo\'s head office and relevant head office functions will remain in
Utrecht, the Netherlands, which shall, following integration with the Dutch
Liberty Global Business, be the head office for the Joint Dutch Operations.
The Ziggo head office will be fully equipped with such functions and resources
as will be necessary to implement and further develop and execute the strategy
and to manage the Joint Dutch Operations, in line with the operating model
used within the Liberty Global Group, where the Joint Dutch Operations will
use certain group-wide functions as shared services and may provide shared
services to other companies in the Liberty Global Group. 

9.5 The Ziggo brand shall be the brand for the Joint Dutch Operations.

10. INTEGRATION

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

The Parties intend to integrate and align their respective Dutch businesses to
fully benefit from their combined reach, scale and resources, in order to
provide a compelling growth platform, maximise the growth potential of the two
businesses and enhance the Parties\' capabilities to service customers. 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

22 

| | 
---|--- 

10.2

|

Until Settlement, the integration of the Dutch Liberty Global Business and
Ziggo will be the responsibility of the respective boards of BidCo and Ziggo.
In order to facilitate such integration, an integration committee will be
established as soon as possible following the date of this Merger Protocol
consisting of six members, three of which will be senior executives of Ziggo
and three will be senior executives of the Liberty Global Group (the
Integration Committee). One of the Liberty Global nominees will act as
chairman and have the casting vote. Until the Settlement Date, the Integration
Committee will report to the boards of BidCo and Ziggo, and after the
Settlement Date, to selected members of the Liberty Global executive
committee. 

| 
---|--- 

10.3

|

During the integration planning phase, the Parties will, subject to compliance
with applicable Antitrust Laws restrictions, set up various workstreams to
discuss the relevant topics (including, but not limited to HR, finance, tax,
IT and technology). As part of this process, the Parties will, for instance,
make their senior technology staff available to discuss the technical aspects
of platform and IT alignment and integration after the Settlement Date and the
implications of the Parties\' current IT and platform strategy on such
alignment and integration, and make their senior tax staff available to
discuss the best means of structuring the tax planning and affairs of the
Joint Dutch Operations and tax aspects of the Merger and the Offer Debt
Financing. 

| 
---|--- 

10.4

|

The Parties will strive to realise the synergies of the Merger as soon as
reasonably possible after Settlement. Ziggo confirms that the Boards
unanimously subscribe to the joint strategic vision underlying the Merger and
support the realisation of those synergies. 

| 
---|--- 

10.5

|

As soon as possible following the date of this Merger Protocol, and subject to
restrictions under the Applicable Rules, the Integration Committee will start
developing a detailed integration plan. The integration plan will describe the
desired organisational structure and processes as well as the detailed steps
required to effect the integration. The Integration Committee will develop an
integration plan for the Joint Dutch Operations, which shall be consistent
with the Dutch Business Strategy. The integration plan, the business plan and
the strategy for the Joint Dutch Operations will, before they are finalised,
be presented by the Integration Committee to the boards of both BidCo and
Ziggo with the objective to obtain their endorsement. The Integration
Committee will take into account all comments received from both boards, with
a view to presenting the finalised plan to the boards of both BidCo and Ziggo.
Immediately after the Settlement Date, the board of BidCo will formally
approve the integration plan, the business plan and the strategy for the Joint
Dutch Operations. 

| 
---|--- 

10.6

|

The Integration Committee will be assisted by a consulting firm, that will be
appointed by BidCo and Ziggo jointly as soon as practically possible following
the Initial Announcement. The costs of the consulting firm will be shared
equally between BidCo and Ziggo. 

| 
---|--- 

10.7

|

Following the Settlement Date, the Integration Committee will continue to be
in place and will be responsible for the implementation of the integration
plan and do all things necessary to optimise the integration of the businesses
of BidCo and Ziggo. 

| 
---|--- 

10.8

|

Prior to the Settlement Date, BidCo and Ziggo will determine the interim
reporting structure for the Ziggo Group within the Combined Group. The final
reporting structure will be described in the integration plan for the Joint
Dutch Operations. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

EMPLOYEES 

Selection

| 
---|--- 

11.1

|

The Parties agree that, following the Settlement Date, the nomination,
selection and appointment of staff for functions within the integrated
Combined Group will, subject to the Applicable Rules, be based 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

23 

| on the "best person for the job" principle, or, where not feasible or
appropriate, on non-discriminatory, fair and business-oriented transparent set
of criteria.

| 
---|--- 

11.2

|

Subject to Clause 6.7(a) the Parties agree that the senior management team and
the direct reports to the senior management team (the "top 75") of the Joint
Dutch Operations will be selected under the supervision of the Integration
Committee on the basis of an individual assessment, taking into account the
new structure and new processes of the Joint Dutch Operations. 

| 
---|--- 

11.3

|

The individual assessment process will be organized and conducted by the
Integration Committee, assisted by a specialised professional advisory firm. 

Employment policies

| 
---|--- 

11.4

|

BidCo and Ziggo acknowledge that the integration of their businesses may have
potential consequences for the employees of the Joint Dutch Operations. The
Parties shall assume responsibility for the related measures and costs thereof
and shall honour the redundancy arrangements, social plans and applicable
contractual arrangements already made or to be made with the relevant
employees. Any future social plans to be agreed in connection with the
combination of the businesses of Liberty Global and Ziggo shall be consistent
with the social plans agreed and applied by Ziggo and the Dutch Liberty Global
Business (as applicable) in connection with recent restructurings, subject to
additional arrangements to address specific issues resulting from the
combination and integration of the businesses of Liberty Global and Ziggo. 

| 
---|--- 

11.5

|

The Works Council and the trade unions will be given the opportunity to
exercise all of its rights pursuant to Applicable Rules and the covenants
entered into with them in relation to any redundancies and specific
integration plans, including, if applicable, their right to provide advice.
Furthermore, all other applicable employee information and consultation
requirements in relation to any redundancies and specific integration plans
will also be complied with at the relevant time. 

| 
---|--- 

11.6

|

Subject to Clause 11.1, the Parties will ensure that the determination and
choice of the redundancies arising from the integration will be made in a
transparent and non-discriminatory manner (and therefore not making a
distinction on the basis of current employer), irrespective whether such
redundancy occurs in connection with an integration with Liberty Global\'s
operations in Schiphol-Rijk, the Netherlands, or the Dutch Liberty Global
Business. 

| 
---|--- 

11.7

|

To the extent required pursuant to existing or future social plans and/or
redundancy plans, the Parties will ensure that any vacancies that arise during
the integration phase within the Combined Group and within the same
geographical area are first offered to employees of the Combined Group who
have or would have become redundant in connection with the Offer and the
contemplated transactions, subject to such employees having the relevant
skills and experience. 

| 
---|--- 

11.8

|

Liberty Global shall offer outplacement services to any employees of the Ziggo
Group that become redundant in connection with the Offer and the contemplated
transactions, to the extent required pursuant to existing or future social
plans and/or redundancy plans. 

| 
---|--- 

11.9

|

After the Settlement Date and, if applicable, for the agreed duration of the
respective arrangements, BidCo will respect and continue the current Ziggo
employee consultation structure (i.e. Works Council and other existing
employee representative bodies) until such time that the integration process
of the Joint Dutch Operations merits a unified employee consultation
structure. 

| 
---|--- 

1.10

|

After the Settlement Date, BidCo shall respect any and all existing rights and
benefits of employees of the Ziggo Group, including under any existing social
plans, profit sharing schemes, covenants (including covenants with the Works
Council) and collective labour agreements (including the employee benefits 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

24 

| included in the terms thereof), as well as the terms of the individual
employment agreements between the Ziggo Group and its employees, for the
agreed duration of these arrangements and agreements or, if earlier, as soon
as any new harmonisation or redundancy plans have been negotiated.

| 
---|--- 

11.11

|

Liberty Global shall respect any and all existing pension rights of the Ziggo
Group\'s current and former employees. The current financial obligations with
respect to the funding of Ziggo\'s pension funds will be respected. 

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

SECURITY AND PRIVACY 

| 
---|--- 

12.1

|

BidCo recognizes the relevance of the Joint Dutch Operations to the national
security of the Netherlands and the importance to the safety, well-being and
privacy of persons in the Netherlands in maintaining the continuity, integrity
and security of the cable infrastructure and cable services in the
Netherlands. Therefore, BidCo is fully committed to Ziggo, and, after the
Settlement Date, to the Joint Dutch Operations, to maintain all required and
commercially reasonable measures to protect against the unauthorized
disclosure of the contents of electronic communications, and to safeguard and
warrant the continuity, integrity and security of its communication systems
and networks and its compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in
this respect. 

| 
---|--- 

12.2

|

BidCo will ensure that all domestic communications infrastructure of the Joint
Dutch Operations will (i) continue to be operated and controlled by the Joint
Dutch Operations; (ii) continue to be located in the Netherlands (to the
extent currently located in the Netherlands) and (iii) continue to be
directed, controlled, supervised and managed by the Joint Dutch Operations,
all in accordance with the requirements of applicable Dutch law and as
otherwise necessary or conducive to conduct the Ziggo business in the
Netherlands. 

| 
---|--- 

12.3

|

BidCo will ensure that the viability, integrity and security of Ziggo\'s
communication systems and networks will be maintained as well as appropriate
security policies and procedures, each at a level which is at least equal to
the current level, so as to ensure that all applicable laws, rules and
regulations in this respect will continue to be complied with, including, but
not limited to, those relating to privacy and to the retention, preservation
or production of information and data. 

| 
---|--- 

13.

(Financing), 6 (Corporate Governance), 7.10 (Post-Closing Restructuring), 8
(Strategy), 9 (Organisation), 10 (Integration), 11 (Employees) and 12

The Parties agree that, in the event that Ziggo ceases to exist during the
duration set out in Clause 13.1 as a result of the integration of the
businesses of Ziggo and the Dutch Liberty Global Business or for any other
reason (such as pursuant to the Asset Sale and Liquidation), the Non-Financial
Covenants shall continue to apply to the holding company of the Joint Dutch
Operations. In such case, all references to Ziggo in the Non-Financial
Covenants shall be deemed to refer to such holding company of the Joint Dutch
Operations, its subsidiaries and its businesses.

|

25 

| | 
---|--- 

13.3

Any deviation from the Non-Financial Covenants shall require the prior

one Continuing Member.

|

The Non-Financial Covenants are made to Ziggo as well as, by way of
irrevocable third party undertaking for no consideration (onherroepelijk
derdenbeding om niet), to each of the two Continuing Members in their capacity
as members of the Supervisory Board, it being understood that the Non-

INCENTIVE PLANS 

| 
---|--- 

15.1

|

At the date of this Merger Protocol, Ziggo has granted conditional performance
shares to members of the Management Board and ten other employees of the Ziggo
Group (the other employees are referred to as Other Participants) pursuant to
the Ziggo Long Term Incentive Plan as approved by the general meeting of
shareholders of Ziggo on 20 March 2012 (LTIP), as disclosed in the Liberty
Global Pre-Announcement Due Diligence (the 2012 and 2013 Awards). Any
conditional performance shares granted by Ziggo pursuant to the LTIP to former
members of the Management Board at the date of this Merger Protocol which have
not yet vested at the date of this Merger Protocol qualify as 2012 and/or 2013
Awards for the purpose of this Clause 15. Furthermore, it is expected that
conditional performance shares will also be granted to the Management Board
and the Other Participants in respect of the years 2014 and, if applicable,
2015, pursuant to a long term incentive plan 2014 and, if applicable, 2015 to

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

50% of the originally granted conditional shares under the 2012 and 2013
Awards will be treated as if they had vested on the Settlement Date in respect

respect of Restricted Stock Units as set out above or parts thereof following
the respective vesting date;

(iii)

|

the relevant persons will not be entitled to Dividend Equivalents as defined
in the Liberty Global Plan; 

"Incentive Share Consideration Mechanism" means the conversion of each
originally granted conditional share under the 2014 LTIP Awards into: (i) a
Restricted Stock Unit comprising 0.3339 Liberty Global A Share (or in the
event that Liberty Global implements the Liberty Global Share Split, 0.3339
Liberty Global A Share) and (ii) a Restricted Stock Unit comprising 0.2450
Liberty Global C Share (or in the event that Liberty Global implements the

the reasonable opinion of Ziggo (including the Supervisory Board), is a bona
fide third party and which proposal in the reasonable opinion of Ziggo
(including the Supervisory Board), having consulted its financial and legal
advisors and considering, among others, level and character of consideration,
certainty of financing, conditionality, integrity of the business and position
of employees, could reasonably be expected to become a Competing Offer.

Ziggo will notify BidCo promptly (and in any event within 24 (twenty-four)

third party, the proposed consideration and other key terms of such Potential

it is launched, or is binding on the offering party concerned in the sense
that such offering party has (i) committed itself under customary conditions
to Ziggo to launch a Competing Offer within eight (8) weeks and (ii) has
publicly announced its intention to launch a Competing Offer, which
announcement includes the proposed price per Share and the relevant conditions
precedent in relation to such offer and the commencement thereof; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the consideration offered per Share is valued at an amount exceeding the Offer

Liberty Global Blended Price) by eight per cent. (8%) or more and is in cash
or in publicly traded equity securities (for these 

 

 
--- 
| | 

|

35 

| purposes valued at the date of the commitment under (a) above). To the extent
that the Potential Competing Offer is an offer for all or substantially all of
the assets of the Ziggo Group, the calculation shall be made on the basis of
the net proceeds to be distributed to the shareholders of Ziggo resulting from
such a transaction calculated on a per Share basis; and

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

it is determined by the Boards, in accordance with Clause 3.3, to be
substantially more beneficial to Ziggo and its stakeholders than the Offer as
contemplated in this Merger Protocol, specifically taking into account the
identity and track record of such third party, the consideration to be
received by shareholders, the likelihood of completion, the other terms and
conditions of the Potential Competing Offer and the interests of all
stakeholders of Ziggo; and 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Ziggo has promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notified BidCo in
writing and provided full details, to the extent available to it, of such
offer. 

| 
---|--- 

21.4

|

If BidCo has matched any Competing Offer in accordance with Clause 21.5, the
consideration per Share of any other, consecutive or amended offer made by any
bona fide third party for all of the outstanding Shares or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Ziggo Group or a merger of Ziggo (a
Subsequent Higher Offer) must exceed the most recently offered consideration
per Share by BidCo after having exercised its Matching Right by at least eight
per cent. (8%), in order for any such Subsequent Higher Offer to qualify as a
Competing Offer for the purpose of this Merger Protocol. 

| 
---|--- 

21.5

|

In the event of a Competing Offer, the following shall apply: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Ziggo shall keep BidCo informed of any material developments in relation to
such Competing Offer; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

BidCo shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days following announcement of
the Competing Offer to decide whether or not it wants to revise its Offer and
match the Competing Offer (the Matching Right); 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

if BidCo exercises its Matching Right and its revised Offer is determined by
the Boards, having consulted their financial and legal advisors and acting in
good faith and observing their obligations under Dutch law, to be at least
equally beneficial to Ziggo and its stakeholders as the Competing Offer within
the aforementioned period of five (5) Business Days (a Matching Revised
Offer), Ziggo shall not be entitled to accept the Competing Offer and/or to
terminate this Merger Protocol, except if permitted by this Clause 21 in
respect of any consecutive Competing Offer; and 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

if BidCo has failed to timely inform Ziggo in accordance with Clause 21.5(b),
or if BidCo has not made a Matching Revised Offer or if BidCo has informed
Ziggo that it does not wish to exercise its Matching Right, Ziggo shall be
entitled to accept the Competing Offer and the Boards shall have the right,
but shall not be obliged, to withdraw or, as applicable, modify the
Recommendation and the Position Statement. If Ziggo accepts the Competing
Offer and this is communicated to BidCo within ten (10) Business Days from the
last day of the aforementioned period of ten (10) Business Days, each Party
shall be entitled, but shall not be obliged, to terminate this Merger Protocol
in accordance with Clause 22. If in such scenario neither Party exercises its
right to terminate this Merger Protocol, this Merger Protocol shall remain in
full force and effect, save for the provisions of Clause 4.5(h) and Clauses
20.1 and 20.2, which shall then no longer apply in relation to the Competing
Offer and the third party having made such Competing Offer.

21.6
