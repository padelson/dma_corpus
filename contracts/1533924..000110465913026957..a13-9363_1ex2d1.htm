Section 3.03 _Title Defect_.

 



 

(a) The term " _Title Defect_ ," as used in this Agreement, shall mean: (i)
any encumbrance, lien, charge, obligation, encroachment or irregularity
affecting, defect in or objection to Sellers ownership of any Asset that, if
not cured, causes Sellers not to have Defensible Title to such Asset as of the
Closing Date; or (ii) any default by any Seller under a Lease, farmout
agreement or other contract or agreement that would (A) have a material
adverse affect on the operation, value or use of such Asset, or (B) prevent
any Seller from receiving the proceeds of production attributable to such
Sellers interest therein.

 



 

(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
shall any of the following constitute a Title Defect: (i) defects based solely
on an assertion that any of Sellers files lack information (including title
opinions); (ii) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to
recite marital status in a document or omissions of successors of heirship or
probate proceedings, unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis for the
assertion that such failure or omission has resulted in a Third Partys actual
and superior claim of title to the affected Asset; (iii) defects arising out
of lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly required by applicable Laws;
and (iv) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity
authorization unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis for the assertion that
the action was not authorized and that such lack of

 



      
 

 



 

authorization has resulted in a Third Partys actual and superior claim of
title to the affected Asset.

 



 

Section 3.04 _Notice of Title Defects_.

 



 

(a) If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset (each, a " _Title
Defect Property_ "), Buyer shall notify Sellers as promptly as possible, but
no later than the expiration of the Examination Period, of such alleged Title
Defect. To be effective, such notice must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received
by Sellers prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe
the Title Defect in sufficient, specific detail (including any alleged
variance in the Net Revenue Interest), (iv) identify the specific Asset or
Assets affected by such Title Defect, and (v) include the value of such Title
Defect as determined by Buyer. Except for Buyers rights under the special
warranty of title contained in the Assignment, any matters that may otherwise
constitute Title Defects, but of which Sellers have not been specifically
notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have
been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall constitute Permitted
Encumbrances and shall not constitute a Title Defect.

 



 

(b) Upon the receipt of such effective notice from Buyer, Sellers and Buyer
shall attempt to mutually agree on a resolution with respect to any alleged
Title Defect. Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
attempt, at their sole cost, to cure or remove on or before sixty (60) days
after the expiration of the Examination Period (the " _Cure Period_ ") any
Title Defects for which Sellers have received a Title Defect notice from Buyer
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period. No reduction shall be made
to the Closing Payment with respect to any Title Defect properly asserted
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (the " _Asserted Title
Defects_ ") and for which Sellers have provided notice to Buyer prior to or on
the Closing Date that Sellers intend to attempt to cure the Title Defect
during the Cure Period or for which Sellers have provided notice to Buyer
prior to or on the Closing Date that Sellers dispute the existence, in whole
or in part, which notice shall include a description of the matters in dispute
(any Asserted Title Defect for which Sellers properly dispute the existence,
in whole or in part, a " _Disputed Defect_ "). Subject to Section 3.05, the
Title Defect Value resulting from the Asserted Title Defects asserted by Buyer
and not cured by Sellers prior to Closing shall be paid to a mutually agreed
escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") at Closing pursuant to a form of escrow
agreement to be mutually agreed to prior to Closing (the " _Escrow Agreement_
"), unless the Parties agree otherwise; provided, however, (i) if Sellers
elect to cure an Asserted Title Defect, the Title Defect Value resulting from
such Asserted Title Defect shall be released to Sellers upon cure if such
Asserted Title Defect is cured by the expiration of the Cure Period (the "
_Remedy Deadline_ "), and if not cured by then, such Title Defect Value shall
be released to Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.04(c),
at such time, or if the relevant Asserted Title Defect becomes subject to
resolution pursuant to Article XVI (a " _Disputed Title Matter_ "), then such
Title Defect Value shall be treated as provided in the following sub-part
(ii), and (ii) if an Asserted Title Defect is a Disputed Defect or Disputed
Title Matter, such Asserted Title Defect shall be finally and exclusively
resolved in accordance with the provisions of Article XVI and release of the
Title Defect Value from escrow for such Asserted Title

 



      
 

 



 

Defect shall be resolved in accordance therewith. If, prior to the expiration
of the Remedy Deadline, Sellers and Buyer cannot agree on (A) the proper and
adequate cure for any such Title Defect, (B) the Title Defect Value or (C)
whether the Asserted Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect, then such
dispute(s) shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the
provisions of Article XVI.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Title Defect (other than a Disputed Title Matter) is
not waived by Buyer or, subject to Section 3.04(b), cured prior to the Remedy
Deadline, then unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties,
subject to Section 3.05, Buyer shall, at its sole election, elect to (i)
retain the Title Defect Property and make a downward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Title Defect Value of such
Title Defect or (ii) exclude the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is
adversely affected by such Title Defect and reconvey such Title Defect
Property to Sellers, in which event, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward, by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property, and such Title Defect Property shall constitute an Excluded
Asset. Upon Buyer making an election pursuant to this Section 3.04(c), the
Parties shall complete any reconveyancing of the relevant Title Defect
Property, if necessary, to effect such election. Any downward adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.04(c), together with
any other adjustments as may be required pursuant to Section 3.04(b), if
applicable, shall be made (and accounted for) in connection with the
preparation of the Final Accounting Statement, except for Title Defects that
Sellers do not dispute or attempt to cure, which Title Defects will be
accounted for at Closing.

 



 

(d) Unless Sellers and Buyer agree otherwise, the value attributable to each
Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Value_ ") that is asserted by Buyer in the
Title Defect notices shall be determined based upon the criteria set forth
below:

 



 

(i) If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset which is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, the Title Defect Value is the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset.

 



 

(ii) If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Acres under a Lease are less
than that stated in _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit D_, the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to any Lease, Well or unit is less than that stated in _Exhibit
A_, _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit D_ or the Working Interest attributable to any
Lease, Well or unit is greater than that stated in _Exhibit A_, _Exhibit B_
or _Exhibit D_ for which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue
Interest, then the Title Defect Value shall take into account the relative
change in the interest from _Exhibit A_, _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit D_ and the
appropriate Allocated Value attributed to such Asset.

 



 

(iii) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for
which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest), other
than as described in Sections 3.04(d)(i) and (ii) for which the economic
detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title Defect Value shall
be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset, the portion of

 



      
 

 



 

the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of
the affected Asset, and the Title Defect Value placed upon the Title Defect by
Buyer and Sellers.

 



 

(iv) If a Title Defect does not adversely affect an Asset throughout the
entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall be taken into account in
determining the Title Defect Value.

 



 

(v) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder.

 



 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a
Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Wells, units or other
Assets affected thereby.

 



 

(vii) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined considering
such other factors as are normally considered in transactions involving the
sale of properties and assets similar to the Assets.

 



 

Section 3.05 _Title Defect Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the Title Defect Value attributable to a
Title Defect Property does not exceed Seventy-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($75,000.00), then no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other
remedy hereunder shall be made for such Title Defect Property, (ii) if the
aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price determined in accordance
with this Agreement for all Title Defects (exceeding Seventy-Five Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00)) does not exceed two percent (2%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then no adjustment
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedy hereunder shall be made
therefor, and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for all Title Defects
(exceeding Seventy-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00)) does exceed
two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any adjustments
thereto, then the Unadjusted Purchase Price and other remedies hereunder shall
only be applicable to the extent of such excess.

 



 

Section 3.06 _Special Warranty of Title_. Each Seller hereby agrees to warrant
and defend title to the Assets solely unto Buyer against every Person
whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof, by,
through or under such Seller and its Affiliates, but not otherwise; subject,
however, to Permitted Encumbrances.

 



 

Section 3.07 _Consents to Assignment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall send to each holder of a consent
pertaining to an Asset and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
those set forth on _Schedule 5.09_ (each, a " _Consent_ "), a notice (in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such
Consent) seeking such Persons consent to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Prior to Closing, with respect to each preferential purchase right,

 



      
 

 



 

right of first refusal or other similar right (each, a " _Preferential
Purchase Right_ ") pertaining to an Asset and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including those set forth on _Schedule 5.09_ , Sellers shall send to
the holder of each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material
compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential
Purchase Right.

 



 

(b) If, prior to the Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
notifies Sellers that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, or if the time for exercising
such Preferential Purchase Right has not expired (each such Asset subject to
an exercised or outstanding Preferential Purchase Right at Closing, a " _Pref-
Right Asset_ "), then such Pref-Right Asset shall be excluded from the Assets
to be acquired by Buyer, and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of such Pref-Right Asset. Sellers shall be entitled to all
proceeds paid by a Person exercising a Preferential Purchase Right with
respect to a Pref-Right Asset. If the holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
applicable to a Pref-Right Asset thereafter fails to consummate the purchase
of such Pref-Right Asset on or before the date that is one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Closing Date (or the time for exercising such
Preferential Purchase Right expires without exercise by the holder thereof),
then Sellers shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, on or before
that date that is ten (10) days following its receipt of such notice of such
Preferential Purchase Right being waived or the time for exercising such right
has expired, such Pref-Right Asset from Sellers, under the terms of this
Agreement, for a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Pref-Right Asset
plus or minus any amount payable with respect to such Pref-Right Asset
pursuant to Section 12.01.

 



 

(c) All Assets with respect to which any Preferential Purchase Right
applicable thereto has been waived or as to which the period to exercise such
right has expired prior to the Closing shall (in each case) be included in the
Assets sold and conveyed to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If as of the Closing, Seller has not obtained a Consent, and the failure
to obtain such Consent would cause (A) the assignment of the Assets affected
thereby to Buyer to be void and/or (B) the termination of the Asset under the
express terms thereof (each, a " _Subject Consent Asset_ ") then such Subject
Consent Asset shall be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer at
Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of the excluded Asset. In the event that a Consent with respect to a
Subject Consent Asset that was not obtained prior to the Closing Date is
obtained within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date then,
within ten (10) days after such Consent is obtained, Sellers shall assign to
Buyer such Subject Consent Asset pursuant to an assignment in form and
substance substantially similar to the Assignment, effective as of the
Effective Time, and Buyer shall pay to Sellers, under the terms of this
Agreement, a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Subject Consent Asset
plus or minus any amount payable with respect to such Subject Consent Asset
pursuant to Section 12.01. From and after the Closing, until the earlier of
the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing and the date that
any Consent applicable to a Subject Consent Asset that has not been assigned
to

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer pursuant hereto is obtained, Sellers shall continue to use all
commercially reasonable efforts (at Buyers sole cost and expense) to obtain
each such Consent to the extent requested by Buyer. Except for any Subject
Consent Assets, all Assets subject to any Consent that is outstanding as of
the Closing shall be included in the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing and
Buyer shall have no claim against, and Sellers shall have no liability for,
its failure to obtain any such Consent; provided, however, that for ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date, Sellers will continue (at Buyers sole
cost and expense) to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Consent of the holders of such unsatisfied Consent to the extent requested by
Buyer, and thereafter will provide, at Buyers sole cost and expense, such
assistance as Buyer may reasonably require in connection with Buyers efforts
to secure the Consent.

 



 

(e) If the Subject Consent Asset is a Contract, and Buyer is assigned the
other Assets to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not
transferred to Buyer due to the unattained Consent, Sellers will continue
after Closing to use reasonable efforts to obtain such Consent, which the
Parties acknowledge and agree shall not require Sellers to pay any monies for
which Buyer has not separately agreed in writing to reimburse Sellers (or
otherwise be responsible) so that such Contract can be transferred to Buyer
upon the receipt of such Consent.

 



 

Section 3.08 _Remedies for Title Benefits_.

 



 

(a) If any Seller discovers any Title Benefit during the Examination Period
affecting the Assets (each, a " _Title Benefit Property_ "), it shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing thereof on or before the expiration of the Examination
Period. To be effective, such notice must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received
by Buyer prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe the
Title Benefit in sufficient, specific detail (including any alleged variance
in the Net Revenue Interest), (iv) identify the specific Asset or Assets
affected by such Title Benefit, and (v) include the value of such Title
Benefit as determined by Sellers. Sellers shall be entitled to an upward
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i)
with respect to all Title Benefits, in an amount determined in accordance with
Section 3.08(c). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ "
shall mean: (i) Sellers Net Revenue Interest in any Subject Interest that is
greater than that set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit D_
(without a corresponding proportional increase in the Working Interest); (ii)
Sellers Working Interest in any Subject Interest that is less than the
Working Interest set forth in _Exhibit A_, _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit D_
(without a corresponding proportional decrease in the Net Revenue Interest)
and (iii) Sellers Net Acres under any Lease that is greater than that set
forth in _Exhibit A_. Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title
Benefits, but of which Buyer has not been specifically notified by Sellers in
accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Sellers
for all purposes. If Buyer discovers any Title Benefit Property during the
Examination Period affecting the Assets for which Sellers have not previously
provided notice, it shall promptly notify Sellers in writing thereof.

 



 

(b) If with respect to a Title Benefit the Parties are not deemed to have
agreed on the amount of the upward Unadjusted Purchase Price adjustment or
have not

 



       
 

 



 

otherwise agreed on such amount on or before two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers or Buyer shall have the right to elect to have such
Unadjusted Purchase Price adjustment determined by an Independent Expert
pursuant to Section 16.03. If the amount of such adjustment is not determined
pursuant to this Agreement before the Closing, the undisputed portion of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price with respect to the Asset affected by such Title
Benefit shall be paid by Buyer at the Closing and, subject to Section 3.08(d),
upon determination of the amount of such adjustment, any unpaid portion
thereof shall be paid by Buyer to Seller.

 



 

(c) The title benefit amount (" _Title Benefit Amount_ ") resulting from a
Title Benefit shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset (" _Title Benefit Property_ ") is increased as a result of the existence
of such Title Benefit and shall be determined in accordance with the following
methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that amount shall
be the Title Benefit Amount; and

 



 

(ii) if the Title Benefit asserted is that the Net Acres or Net Revenue
Interest attributable to any Lease, Well or unit is greater than that stated
in _Exhibit A_, _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit D_ or the Working Interest
attributable to any Lease, Well or unit is less than that stated in _Exhibit
A_, _Exhibit B_ or _Exhibit D_ for which there is not a proportionate
decrease in Net Revenue Interest, then the Title Benefit Amount shall take
into account the relative change in the interest from _Exhibit A_, _Exhibit
B_ or _Exhibit D_ and the appropriate Allocated Value attributed to such
Asset.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the
Title Benefit Amount attributable to a Title Benefit Property does not exceed
Seventy-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00), then no adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedy hereunder shall be made for such
Title Benefit Property, (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for all Title
Benefits (exceeding Seventy-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00))
does not exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any
adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of the Unadjusted Purchase Price or
other remedy hereunder shall be made therefor, and (iii) if the aggregate
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price determined in accordance with this
Agreement for all Title Benefits (exceeding Seventy-Five Thousand and No/100
Dollars ($75,000.00)) does exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Unadjusted Purchase Price and
other remedies hereunder shall only be applicable to the extent of such
excess.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Article IV 
Environmental Matters**

 



 

Section 4.01 _Environmental Review_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause a consultant (" _Buyer s
Environmental Consultant_") to conduct an environmental review of the Assets
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (" _Buyer s Environmental
Review_"). The cost and expense of Buyers Environmental Review, if any, shall
be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer shall (and shall cause Buyers Environmental
Consultant to): (i) perform all such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and
so as to not unreasonably interfere with Sellers operations, and (ii) comply
with all applicable Laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the work.
Sellers shall have the right to have a representative or representatives
accompany Buyer and Buyers Environmental Consultant at all times during
Buyers Environmental Review. With respect to any samples taken in connection
with Buyers Environmental Review, Buyer shall, upon the request of any
Sellers representative, take split samples, providing one of each such
sample, properly labeled and identified, to Sellers. Buyer hereby agrees to
release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from and against all
claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes of action and judgments of
any kind or character **(INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM ANY SELLER S SOLE,
JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO BUYERS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES
ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE
SELLERS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE
CONTRARY, NEITHER BUYER NOR BUYERS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT SHALL HAVE ACCESS
TO, OR SHALL BE PERMITTED TO CONDUCT, ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DUE DILIGENCE
(INCLUDING ANY PHASE I ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENTS) WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ASSET WHERE SELLERS DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT ACCESS TO SUCH PERSONS
FOR SUCH DUE DILIGENCE.**

 



 

(b) During the Examination Period, subject to the provisions below regarding
Buyers right to request authorization to conduct Phase II Activity, Buyers
inspection right with respect to the environmental condition of the Assets
shall be limited to conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the
Assets and Buyer may conduct visual inspections and record reviews relating to
the Assets, including their condition and compliance with Environmental Laws.
" _Phase I Environmental Site Assessment_ " means an environmental site
assessment performed pursuant to the American Society for Testing and
Materials E1527 - 05, or any similar non-invasive environmental assessment.
Buyer shall not operate any equipment or conduct any testing or sampling of
soil, groundwater or other materials (including any testing or sampling for
Hazardous Substances, Hydrocarbons or NORM) (" _Phase II Activity_ "). If,
following the conduct of the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, Buyer
reasonably believes that any Phase II Activity is necessary for it to
determine the existence and/or magnitude of an Environmental Defect, Buyer
shall furnish to Sellers for their review a proposed scope of such Phase II
Activity, including a reasonable description of such activity and a
description of the approximate locations of any sampling to be conducted.
Following the receipt and review of such proposal by Sellers, Sellers shall
elect, in their sole discretion, to permit or refuse to permit the conduct of
any Phase II Activity by Buyer; provided,

 



      
 

 



 

however, that if Sellers refuse to permit the conduct of the Phase II
Activity, then the Assets with respect to which Buyer requested permission to
conduct such Phase II Activity may, at Buyers option, be excluded from the
Assets to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of such Assets.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall (and shall cause
Buyers Environmental Consultant to) treat confidentially any matters revealed
by Buyers Environmental Review and any reports or data generated from such
review (the " _Environmental Information_ "), and Buyer shall not (and shall
cause Buyers Environmental Consultant to not) disclose any Environmental
Information to any Governmental Authority or other Third Party without the
prior written consent of Sellers, unless immediate disclosure is required by
Law to prevent an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the
environment. Unless otherwise required by Law, Buyer may use the Environmental
Information only in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If Buyer, Buyers Environmental Consultant, or any Third Party to
whom Buyer has provided any Environmental Information becomes legally
compelled to disclose any of the Environmental Information, Buyer shall
provide Sellers with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure
so as to allow Sellers to file any protective order, or seek any other remedy,
as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. At the request of any Seller,
Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental Information to Sellers without
charge as soon as practicable after Buyer receives the Environmental
Information. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, (i) at the
request of any Seller, Buyer shall deliver any Environmental Information to
Sellers that has not been previously delivered to Sellers and (ii) all of the
Environmental Information delivered to Sellers shall become the sole property
of Sellers.

 



 

Section 4.02 _Environmental Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the
terms set forth below shall have the following meanings.

 



 

(a) " _Environmental Defect_ " shall mean, with respect to any given Asset,

(d) " _Environmental Defect Value_ " shall mean, with respect to any
Environmental Defect for a given Asset, the value, as of the Closing Date, of
the estimated costs and expenses to correct such Environmental Defect in the
most cost-effective manner reasonably available, in such a manner that is in
conformance with applicable Environmental Laws taking into account that non-
permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous
Substances, including monitoring site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-
based corrective action, institutional controls or other appropriate
restrictions on the use of property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, leachate
collection systems, etc.) may be the most cost-effective manner reasonably
available.

 



 

(e) " _Hazardous Substances_ " means any pollutants, contaminants, toxic or
hazardous substances, materials, wastes, constituents, compounds or chemicals
that are regulated by, or may form the basis of liability under any
Environmental Laws, including asbestos-containing materials (but excluding any

responsibility, directive (including requirements embodied in Environmental
Laws), injunction, judgment or similar act (including settlements) by any
Governmental Authority or court of competent jurisdiction to the extent
arising out of any violation of, or remedial or corrective action obligation
under, any Environmental Laws which are attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Assets or (ii) pursuant to any claim or cause of action by a
Governmental Authority or other Person for personal injury, property damage,
damage to natural resources, remediation or response costs to the extent
arising out of any violation of, or any remediation obligation under, any
Environmental Laws which is attributable to the ownership or operation of the
Assets.

 



 

Section 4.03 _Notice of Environmental Defects_.

 



 

(a) If Buyer discovers any Environmental Defect affecting the Assets (each, an
" _Environmental Defect Property_ "), Buyer shall notify Sellers prior to the

(i) be in writing; (ii) be received by Sellers prior to the expiration of the
Examination Period; (iii) describe the Environmental Defect in sufficient
detail for Sellers to reasonably determine the basis for the Environmental
Defect; (iv) identify the specific Assets affected by such Environmental
Defect; and (v) state Buyers estimate of the Environmental Defect Value,

 



      
 

 



 

including the basis for such estimate, for which Buyer would agree to adjust
the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) Any matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but of
which Sellers have not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with
the foregoing, together with any environmental matter that does not constitute
an Environmental Defect or that does not constitute a breach of any Sellers
representations and warranties pursuant to this Agreement, shall, subject to
Section 14.01, be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and
constitute an Assumed Obligation (as defined in Section 14.02).

 



 

(c) Each Environmental Defect Property for which Buyer has asserted an
Environmental Defect Notice in good faith prior to the expiration of the
Examination Period shall not be conveyed to Buyer at Closing pending the
resolution of such Environmental Defect pursuant to the terms of this Section
4.03. No reduction shall be made at Closing to the Closing Payment with
respect to any Environmental Defect for which Sellers have provided notice to
Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Environmental
Defects_ ") that Sellers intend to cure the Environmental Defect during the
Environmental Cure Period or for which Sellers have provided notice to Buyer
prior to or on the Closing Date that Sellers dispute the existence, in whole
or in part, which notice shall include a description of the matters in dispute
(any asserted Environmental Defect for which Sellers properly disputes the
existence, in whole or in part, a " _Disputed Environmental Defect_ ").
Subject to Section 4.04, the Allocated Value of the Assets for which Buyer has
asserted a Pre-Closing Environmental Defect shall be paid to the Escrow Agent
at Closing, unless the Parties agree otherwise with respect to any Pre-Closing
Environmental Defect prior to Closing; provided, however _,_ (i) if Sellers
elect to cure a Pre-Closing Environmental Defect, and (A) if such Pre-Closing
Environmental Defect is cured by the end of the Environmental Cure Period, (1)
the Allocated Value of the applicable Environmental Defect Property shall be
released from escrow to Sellers and (2) the Environmental Defect Property
shall be conveyed to Buyer, but (B) if cure has not been achieved by the end
of the Environmental Cure Period, in accordance with Section 4.03(e), the
Allocated Value or the Allocated Value less the Environmental Defect Value, as
applicable, in accordance with Section 4.03(e), for the applicable
Environmental Defect Property shall be released from escrow to Buyer or
Sellers, as applicable, at such time, and the applicable Environmental Defect
Property shall either be conveyed to Buyer or retained by Seller (in which
case, such Environmental Defect Property will constitute an Excluded Asset) in
accordance with Section 4.03(e), or (ii) if a Pre-Closing Environmental Defect
is a Disputed Environmental Defect, such Pre-Closing Environmental Defect
shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of
Article XVI and release of the Allocated Value from escrow for such Pre-
Closing Environmental Defect shall be resolved in accordance therewith.

 



 

(d) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at their
sole cost, to cure or remove on or before sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date (the " _Environmental Cure Period_ ") any Environmental Defects for which
Sellers have

 



      
 

 



 

received an Environmental Defect Notice from Buyer prior to the expiration of
the Examination Period; provided, however, that any downward adjustments to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price made pursuant to Section 4.03(e) shall occur at
the times set forth in Section 12.02; and provided, further, that if, prior to
the end of the Environmental Cure Period, Sellers and Buyer cannot agree on
(i) the proper and adequate cure for any such Environmental Defect, (ii) the
Environmental Defect Value or (iii) whether the alleged Environmental Defect
constitutes an Environmental Defect, such dispute(s) shall be finally and
exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of Article XVI. Any
Disputed Environmental Defects that have not been cured, waived or otherwise
resolved by the Parties prior to the end of the Environmental Cure Period
shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of
Article XVI.

 



 

(e) In the event that any Environmental Defect is not waived by Buyer or,
subject to Section 4.03(c), cured prior to the expiration of the Environmental
Cure Period, then unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parties,
subject to Section 4.04, Buyer shall, at its sole election, elect to (i) make
a downward adjustment equal to the Environmental Defect Value of such
Environmental Defect Property and receive a conveyance from Seller of such
Environmental Defect Property or (ii) exclude the entirety of the
Environmental Defect Property that is adversely affected by such Environmental
Defect, in which event, Sellers shall retain the Environmental Defect Property
and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward, by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property, and such
Environmental Defect Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset. Upon Buyer
electing to remedy an Environmental Defect pursuant to this Section 4.03(e),
the Parties shall complete any further conveyancing, if necessary, to effect
the elected remedy. Any downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 4.03 shall be made (and accounted for) as part of the
Final Accounting Statement, except for Environmental Defects that Sellers do
not dispute or attempt to cure, which Environmental Defects will be accounted
for at Closing.

 



 

Section 4.04 _Environmental Defect Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the Environmental Defect Value
attributable to an Environmental Defect Property does not exceed Seventy-Five
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00), then no adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price or other remedy hereunder shall be made for such Environmental
Defect Property, (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for all Environmental
Defects (exceeding Seventy-Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00)) does
not exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price prior to any
adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of the Unadjusted Purchase Price or
other remedy hereunder shall be made therefor, and (iii) if the aggregate
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price determined in accordance with this
Agreement for all Environmental Defects (exceeding Seventy-Five Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($75,000.00)) does exceed two percent (2%) of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Unadjusted Purchase
Price and other remedies hereunder shall only be applicable to the extent of
such excess.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.05 _Termination_. If, after taking into account the limitations set
forth in Section 3.05 and Section 4.04, at any time prior to the Closing the
sum (without duplication) of (i) the aggregate undisputed Title Defect Values
for all undisputed Title Defects, plus (ii) the aggregate Title Defect Values
asserted in good faith by Buyer with respect to all other Title Defects
asserted by Buyer in good faith and not cured by Sellers prior to the Closing,
plus (iii) the aggregate undisputed Environmental Defect Values for all
undisputed Environmental Defects, plus (iv) the aggregate Environmental Defect
Values asserted in good faith by Buyer with respect to all other Environmental
Defects asserted by Buyer in good faith and not cured by Sellers prior to the
Closing exceeds five percent (5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, then
either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other and
neither Party shall thereafter have any further rights or obligations
hereunder, other than as set forth in Article XI and Article XVI.

pay to Buyer, at least five (5) days prior to the due date of such Asset
Taxes, Sellers share of such Asset Taxes to the extent such amounts were not
credited to Buyer in calculating adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 12.01.

 



 

Section 9.04 _Tax Deferred Exchange_. To the extent allowable by Law, any
combination of Sellers and/or Buyer may, at or before the Closing, elect to
effect a tax-deferred exchange of the Assets for other qualifying properties
(the " _Exchange Property_ ") in accordance with the following:

 



 

(a) In the event any Seller makes such an election prior to the Closing, such
Seller may elect, by notice to Buyer delivered on or before the Closing Date,
to have the Purchase Price payable to such Seller paid to a qualified
intermediary until such Seller has designated the Exchange Property. The
Exchange Property shall be designated by such Seller and acquired by the
qualified intermediary within the time periods prescribed in Section
1031(a)(3) of the Code, and shall thereupon be conveyed to such Seller. In the
event such Seller fails to designate and the qualified intermediary fails to
acquire the Exchange Property within such time periods, the agency or trust
shall terminate and the proceeds then held by the qualified intermediary shall
be paid immediately to such Seller.

 



 

(b) In the event Buyer makes such an election prior to the Closing, Buyer may
elect, by notice to Sellers delivered on or before the Closing Date, to have
the Assets

 



      
 

 



 

conveyed to a qualified intermediary or an exchange accommodation titleholder
(as that term is defined in Rev. Proc. 2000-37 issued effective September 15,
2000).

 



 

(c) The rights and responsibilities of Sellers, Buyer and the qualified
intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder shall be documented with
such agreements containing such terms and provisions as shall be reasonably
determined by Sellers and Buyer to be necessary to accomplish a tax-deferred
exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, subject, however, to the limitations
on costs and liabilities of Buyer and Sellers set forth below. If any Seller
makes a tax-deferred exchange election, Buyer and the other Seller shall not
be obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations
in the acquisition of the Assets. If Buyer makes a tax-deferred exchange
election, no Seller shall be obligated to pay any additional costs or incur
any additional obligations in the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. Any such tax-deferred exchange election by any
Party shall not affect the duties, rights or obligations of the other Parties,
except as expressly set forth in this Section 9.04. Neither Sellers nor Buyer
makes any representations as to any particular tax treatment that may be
afforded to the other Party by reason of such assignment or any other actions
taken in connection with the exchange under Section 1031 of the Code.

 



 

(d) Should either one or both Sellers or Buyer make such an election and
should the tax-deferred exchange fail or be disallowed by the Internal Revenue
Service for any reason, the non-electing Partys or Parties sole
responsibility and liability to the electing Party shall be to take such
actions as are required by subsections (a), (b) or (c) above and such non-
electing Party or Parties shall have no other responsibility or liability
whatsoever to the electing Party; and the electing Party shall release,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the non-electing Party or Parties from any
responsibility or liability related to such election except for such actions
as may be required by subsections (a), (b) or (c) above.

 



 

Section 9.05 _Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes_. Promptly after
the execution of this Agreement, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sellers a
proposed allocation of the Unadjusted Purchase Price among each of the Assets
in compliance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Thereafter, Buyer and Sellers will use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree upon such allocation. To the extent permitted by
Law, such allocation of value shall be generally treated as Class V assets for
purposes of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594. Such agreed allocation for any
Asset shall be consistent with Section 2.02 and shall be increased or reduced
as described in Articles III and IV (the " _Tax Allocated Value_ "). Sellers
and Buyer agree (1) that the Tax Allocated Values shall be used by Sellers and
Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of
all federal, state, and local Tax Returns, including without limitation
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and (2) that neither they nor their
Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with the Tax Allocated Values in
notices to Governmental Authorities, in audit or other proceedings with
respect to Taxes unless required by applicable Law or with the consent of the
other Party. Buyer and Sellers agree that each shall furnish the other a copy
of Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) proposed to be
filed with the Internal Revenue Service by such party or any Affiliate thereof
ten (10) days prior to such filing.

 



   

     
 

 



 

Section 9.06 _Tax Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
under this Agreement. Sellers and Buyer agree to retain all Records with
respect to tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any tax period
beginning before the Effective Time until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective tax periods and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

 



 

Section 9.07 _Section 754 Election_. Sellers shall cause each tax partnership
identified in _Schedule 5.20_ to have in effect a valid election under Section
754 of the Code for the taxable year of such tax partnership that includes the
Closing Date.

 



 

Section 9.08 _Tax Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the definitions set forth below:

 



 

(a) The term " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means all taxes of any kind, levies and

(c) The term " _Tax Return_ " means any return, declaration, report, claim for

 **Article X 
The Closing**

 



 

Section 10.01 _Time and Place of the Closing_. If the conditions referred to
in Articles VII and VIII of this Agreement have been satisfied or waived in
writing, the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Panther, whose address is 15 E. 5th Street, Suite 2100, Tulsa,
Oklahoma 74103 on May 31, 2013, or if all conditions in Article VII and VIII
to be satisfied prior to Closing have not yet seen satisfied or waived by such
date, then within five (5) Business Days of such conditions having been
satisfied or waived, subject to the right of the Parties under Article XI. The
date on which the Closing occurs shall be referenced to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 10.02 _Adjustments to Purchase Price at the Closing_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased by (i)
all upward adjustments for Title Benefits determined in accordance with
Article III, (ii) the Post-Execution Option Lease Amount, if any and (iii) any
other amount provided for in this Agreement or agreed upon by Buyer and
Sellers (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 12.01).

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by (i)
all downward adjustments for Title Defects and Environmental Defects
determined in accordance with Article III and Article IV and (ii) any other
amount provided for in this Agreement or agreed upon by Buyer and Seller
(including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 12.01).

 



 

(c) The adjustments described in Sections 10.02(a) and (b) are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Purchase Price Adjustments_ ", and the purchase price
resulting from such adjustments shall be the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ ".

 



 

Section 10.03 _Closing Statement_. On or before ten (10) days prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, in good faith, using
and based upon the best information reasonably available to Sellers, a closing
statement estimating the initial Adjusted Purchase Price to be paid at
Closing, after giving effect to all adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price set forth in Section 10.02 and any other agreed upon amounts for Title
Defects, setting forth each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price it
anticipates to be appropriate as of the Closing Date necessary to determine
the Adjusted Purchase Price (as of the Closing Date) and providing supporting
documentation showing the calculation of such adjustments in accordance with
Section 10.02 (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ "). Buyer will have
five (5) days after receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement to review
such statement and to provide written notice to Sellers of Buyers objection
to any item on the statement. Buyers notice will clearly identify the item(s)
objected to and the reasons and support for the objection(s). The Parties
shall attempt to agree on the amount of the Adjusted Purchase Price to be paid
at the Closing no later than three (3) days prior to Closing. If the Parties
do not agree by that date, Sellers good faith estimate shall be used to
determine the adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price. If Buyer does not
provide written objection(s) within the five (5) day period, the Parties will
treat the Preliminary Settlement Statement as correct for purposes of
determining the adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing. The
amount to be paid by Buyer to Sellers at the Closing in accordance with this
Section 10.03 shall be the " _Closing Payment_ ".

 



 

Section 10.04 _Actions of Sellers at the Closing_. At the Closing, Sellers
shall:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) execute, acknowledge and deliver to Buyer an assignment in a form
substantially similar to _Exhibit E_ to this Agreement (the " _Assignment_ ")
and such other instruments (in form and substance mutually agreed upon by

Buyer, in sufficient duplicate originals to allow recording in all appropriate
jurisdictions and offices, including any state, federal or agency form
assignments necessary to convey the Assets to Buyer;

 



 

(b) execute, acknowledge and deliver to Buyer letters in lieu of transfer or

 **Article XI 
Termination**

 



 

Section 11.01 _Right of Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time at or prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by written consent of all of the Parties;

 



 

(b) by Sellers or by Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
August 1, 2013 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided, however, in the event
that all conditions in Article VII and Article VIII are satisfied other than
(i) those conditions precedent which by their terms can only be satisfied
simultaneously with the Closing but which are capable of being satisfied at
the Closing and (ii) Sections 7.06 and 8.05 as a result of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act having not terminated or expired, then
neither Buyer nor Sellers may terminate this Agreement under this clause (b)
until after an additional sixty (60) days after the Termination Date;

 



 

(c) by any Party if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
judgment or decree or taken any other action challenging, delaying,
restraining, enjoining, prohibiting or invalidating the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated herein;

 



 

(d) by Buyer, upon delivery of written notice to Sellers at any time prior to
the Closing in the event that Sellers have breached in any material respect
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, Buyer
has notified Seller of the breach in writing, and the breach has continued
without cure for a period of thirty (30) days after the written notice of
breach;

 



 

(e) by Sellers, upon delivery of written notice to Buyer at any time prior to
the Closing in the event that Buyer has breached in any material respect any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, Sellers have
notified Buyer of the breach in writing, and the breach has continued without
cure for a period of thirty (30) days after the written notice of breach;

 



 

(f) by Sellers or by Buyer in accordance with Section 4.05; or

 



      
 

 



 

(g) by Buyer in accordance with Section 13.08;

 



 

provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01 if such Party is at such time in
material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Closing does not occur as a result of any Party
exercising its right to terminate pursuant to Section 11.01, other than as a
result of a Material Breach, this Agreement shall be null and void and no
Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement,
except: (i) Buyers indemnity and confidentiality obligations contained in
Section 4.01 and 13.02; (ii) the Parties obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 17.04); (iii) the Parties
respective representations and warranties under Sections 5.04 and 6.04; and
(iv) this Section 11.02, which shall remain effective, operational and
enforceable. Additionally, Article XVI (Dispute Resolution) and Article XVII
(Miscellaneous) shall continue to have effect pursuant to their terms;
provided, however, that a termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any
Party from any liability for Losses (as defined in Section 14.03) incurred as
a result of a breach by such Party of its representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder occurring prior to such
termination.

 



 

(b) In the event of a Material Breach as a result of which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 11.01(e), Sellers may seek any remedy
available at Law or equity; provided, however, that in the event of a Material
Breach as a result of which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 11.01(e) and if all conditions precedent to Buyers obligation to
Closing under Article VIII are satisfied or waived in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (other than those conditions precedent which by their
terms can only be satisfied simultaneously with the Closing but which are
capable of being satisfied at the Closing), Sellers may elect to collect from
Buyer, and Buyer shall pay, ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price, as their sole and exclusive remedies under this Agreement, as
liquidated damages in lieu of pursuing any other remedy available at law or
equity, which amount shall be payable within three (3) Business Days after
such termination in U.S. Dollars to an account designated in writing by the
Sellers.

 



 

(c) The provision for payment of liquidated damages in Section 11.02(b) has
been included because, in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 11.01(e) because of a Material Breach by Buyer, the actual
damages to be incurred by Sellers can reasonably be expected to approximate
the amount of liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual
amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure
accurately.

 



 

(d) " _Material Breach_ " means (i) Buyer has taken any action or omitted to
take any action where such action or failure resulted in the breach or
omission in any material respect of (a) any of Buyers representations or
warranties set forth herein or (b) any covenants of Buyer hereunder which are
to be performed or observed at or prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing or (ii) Buyer has not been able to arrange to have sufficient funds
available to enable Buyer to pay or is otherwise unable or unwilling to pay in
full the Closing Payment amount at Closing.

 



 

Section 11.03 _Specific Performance_. Subject to Section 11.02(b) and Section
14.06, the Parties each acknowledge that the rights of each Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are special, unique
and of extraordinary character and that, in the event that any Party violates
or fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made it in this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party may be without an adequate remedy at Law.
The Parties agree, therefore, that in the event that any Party violates or
fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such Party in
this Agreement, any non-breaching Party may, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, institute and prosecute an action to enforce specific performance
of such covenant or agreement, in addition to pursuing any other remedy
available at Law or in equity.

 



 

Section 11.04 _Attorneys  Fees, Etc_. If any Party to this Agreement resorts
to legal proceedings to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such
proceedings shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred by such Party,
including reasonable attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief to which
such Party may be entitled. **NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS
AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ANY PUNITIVE,
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNLESS SAME ARE A PART OF A THIRD PARTY
CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY IS SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES**.

 



 

 **Article XII 
Post-Closing Obligations**

 



 

Section 12.01 _Allocation of Expense and Revenues_.

 



 

(a) Provided that the Closing occurs, appropriate adjustments shall be made
between Buyer and Sellers so that (i) Buyer will receive all proceeds from
sales of Hydrocarbons that are produced and saved from and after the Effective
Time and any other revenues arising out of the ownership or operation of the
Assets from and after the Effective Time, net of all applicable production,
severance, and similar Taxes, and Buyer shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses that are incurred in the ownership or operation of the Assets from
and after the Effective Time, including, without limitation, all drilling
costs, all capital expenditures, all overhead charges under applicable
operating or other agreements (regardless of whether a Seller or an Affiliate
of a Seller serves as operator prior to the Closing); provided Sellers shall
not have committed the Assets to any capital or other expenditures other than
as described in _Schedule 13.01_ for the period from and after the Effective
Time or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties, and (ii) Sellers will receive
all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons that are produced and saved prior to
the Effective Time and any other revenues arising out of the ownership or
operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time, net of all applicable
production, severance, and

 



      
 

 



 

similar Taxes, and Sellers shall be responsible for all costs and expenses
that are incurred in the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) In addition to but without duplication of the foregoing, Sellers will be
paid (i) the amount as of the Effective Time of all prepaid Asset Taxes and
any prepaid costs, including rentals and insurance premiums attributable to
the Assets, insofar as such prepaid costs relate to periods of time after the
Effective Time (as determined in the case of Asset Taxes pursuant to Section
9.03), and (ii) the value of all merchantable Hydrocarbons produced prior to
the Effective Time but in storage above the inlet connection or upstream of
the applicable sales meter on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) In addition to but without duplication of the foregoing, Buyer will be
paid (i) an amount equal to all unpaid Asset Taxes that are attributable to
periods of time prior to the Effective Time (as determined pursuant to Section
9.03), which amounts shall, to the extent not actually assessed, be computed
based on such Asset Taxes for the preceding taxable period (such amount to be
determined pursuant to Section 9.03 for the period of Sellers and Buyers
ownership before, at, and after the Effective Time), and (ii) an amount equal
to all cash in, or attributable to, suspense accounts relative to the Assets
for which Buyer has assumed responsibility under Section 14.02.

 



 

(d) In addition to the foregoing, appropriate adjustments shall be made
between Buyer and Sellers so that any production or pipeline imbalances
attributable to the Assets, if any, with respect to periods prior to the
Effective Time are borne solely by Sellers and any such imbalances, if any,
with respect to periods on and after the Effective Time are borne solely by
Buyer.

 



 

(e) All Tax credits (including Tax credits for horizontal wells) applicable to
the Assets for periods prior to the Effective Time shall be allocated to and
for the benefit of Sellers, provided that such credits shall be given at such
time as actually realized by Buyer and granted by the taxing authorities. All
Tax rebates and refunds applicable to the Assets for periods prior to the
Effective Time shall be allocated to and for the benefit of Sellers, provided
that such rebates or refunds are actually received by Buyer.

 



 

(f) All amounts due under this Section 12.01 will be settled initially at
Closing and finally in accordance with Final Accounting Statement under
Section 12.02; provided however, to the extent Buyer takes a Tax credit or
receives a Tax refund or rebate to which Sellers are entitled pursuant to
Section 12.01(e) after the Final Accounting Statement is settled, Buyer shall
promptly make a payment to Sellers in the amount of such Tax credit, refund or
rebate.

 



 

Section 12.02 _Final Accounting Statement_.

 



 

(a) On or before ninety (90) days after the latest of the Closing Date and the
resolution of all Title Defects and Environmental Defects pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a post-
Closing statement setting forth a detailed calculation of all Unadjusted
Purchase Price adjustments applicable to the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the "
_Accounting Statement_ "). The Accounting Statement

 



      
 

 



 

shall include any adjustment or payment which was not finally determined as of
the Closing Date and the allocation of revenues and expenses as determined in
accordance with Section 12.01. To the extent reasonably required by Sellers,
Buyer shall assist in the preparation of the Accounting Statement. Sellers
shall provide Buyer such data and information as Buyer may reasonably request
supporting the amounts reflected on the Accounting Statement in order to
permit Buyer to perform or cause to be performed an audit. The Accounting
Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the thirtieth
(30th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives written
notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Sellers prior
to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in detail the dollar
amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by Sellers in a timely manner, then the Parties shall
resolve the Dispute (as defined in Section 16.01) evidenced by the Notice of
Disagreement in accordance with Article XVI.

 



 

(b) Within five Business Days after the Final Accounting Statement becomes
final, Sellers shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Sellers in immediately
available funds the net amount due. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Final Accounting Statement_ " shall mean (i) the Accounting Statement sent by
Sellers to Buyer unless Buyer gives a Notice of Disagreement in accordance
with Section 12.02(a), or (ii) upon resolution of any Dispute contained in
such Notice of Disagreement, the revised Accounting Statement reflecting such
resolution, which the Parties shall issue, or cause the Independent Expert to
issue.

 



 

Section 12.03 _Further Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall make the Records available to be picked up by Buyer at the
offices of Panther during normal business hours within five Business Days
after the Closing to the extent the Records are in the possession of Sellers
and are not subject to contractual restrictions on transferability. Sellers
shall have the right to retain copies of any of the Records and the rights
granted under Section 17.04.

 



 

(b) After the Closing Date, each Party, at the request of the other and
without additional consideration, shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to
be executed and delivered, from time to time such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and shall take such other action as the other Party
may reasonably request to convey and deliver the Assets to Buyer and to
accomplish the orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, the Parties will cooperate
to have all proceeds received attributable to the Assets be paid to the proper
Party hereunder and to have all expenditures to be made with respect to the
Assets be made by the proper Party hereunder.

 



 

Section 12.04 _Recording Expenses_. As soon as practicable after Closing,
Buyer shall record the Assignment(s), all other state and federal transfer
documents, and all other instruments that must be filed to effectuate the
transfer of the Assets, in the appropriate counties as well as with any
appropriate governmental agencies and provide Sellers with copies of all
recorded or approved instruments. Buyer shall bear all costs of recording and
filing under this Section 12.04.

that any Seller is restricted from disclosing as a result of confidentiality
arrangements under any agreement with Third Parties to the extent requested by

Agreement, including (i) audited financial statements applicable to the Assets
for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, (ii) unaudited

commercially reasonable efforts to provide such reasonable cooperation as may

similar to the Financing.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Buyer shall reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates for all out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in performing its obligations under this Section

providing the Financing to fund on or prior to the Closing Date the financing
amounts required to consummate the Closing.

not, and shall not authorize or permit any of their Affiliates or any of their
representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) encourage, solicit, initiate,
facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (b) enter
into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any
Person (other than as permitted under this Agreement and other than to Buyer
or any of its Affiliates and/or its or their respective representatives)
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal or (c) enter into any agreements or
other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal.
Sellers shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall cause
its Affiliates and all of its and their representatives to immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions and negotiations with any
Persons (other than Buyer and/or its Affiliates) with respect to, or that

Seller_.

 



 

(a) From and after the date of execution of this Agreement and until the

agreements, Panther shall use its reasonable efforts to operate the Assets and

administer the Assets in a manner consistent

 



      
 

 



 

with its past practices, and shall carry on its business with respect to the
Assets in substantially the same manner as before execution of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that each Seller owns undivided interests in some or
all of the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other
working interest owners (other than a Seller) shall not constitute a violation
of the provisions of this Article XIII, nor shall any action required by a
vote of working interest owners constitute such a violation so long as each
Seller has voted its interests in a manner that complies with the provisions
of this Article XIII. To the extent that a Seller is not the operator of any
of the Assets, the obligations of each Seller in this Article XIII shall be
construed to require that each Seller use reasonable efforts (without being
obligated to incur any expense or institute any cause of action) to cause the
operator of such Assets to take such actions or render such performance within
the constraints of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable
agreements.

 



 

Section 13.08 _Casualty Loss_.

intended purpose by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or
under right of eminent domain (each a " _Casualty Loss_ "), and the loss as a
result of such individual Casualty Loss exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price, Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement at any
time prior to Closing. In the event that Buyer does not elect to terminate
this Agreement, Sellers shall elect by written notice to Buyer prior to
Closing either (i) to cause the Assets adversely affected by any such
individual Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least their
condition prior to such Casualty Loss, at Sellers sole cost and expense,
prior to the Closing Date or (ii) for the Unadjusted Purchase Price to be
reduced by the sums of all amounts paid to Sellers by Third Parties by reason
of such Casualty Loss and Sellers shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer
or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in
unpaid awards, condemnation payments, insurance proceeds and other rights and
claims against Third Parties arising out of the Casualty Loss.

 



 

(b) If, after the Execution Date, but prior to the Closing Date, any Casualty
Loss occurs, and the loss as a result of such individual Casualty Loss is
fifteen percent (15%) or less of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, Buyer shall
nevertheless be required to close, and Sellers shall deduct from the
Unadjusted Purchase Price all sums paid to Sellers by Third Parties by reason
of such individual Casualty Loss and shall assign, transfer and set over to
Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any)
in unpaid awards, condemnation payments, insurance proceeds and other rights
and claims against Third Parties arising out of the Casualty Loss.

the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and

(b) The Parties hereby expressly agree that the provisions of Sections 17.11,
17.12, 17.14, and this Section 17.07(b) shall not be amended in any manner
adverse to the Persons that have committed to provide or otherwise entered
into agreements in connection with the Financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and representatives involved in the Financing and their
permitted successors and assigns (the " _Financing Sources_ ") without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 17.08 _Waiver_. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof

release or other public announcement regarding the existence of this
Agreement, the contents hereof or the

 



       
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby which specifically references any other Party

provided, however, that the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures to the
extent (1) necessary for a Party to perform this Agreement (including
disclosures to Governmental Authorities or Third Parties holding Preferential
Purchase Rights, Consents or other rights that may be applicable to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably necessary to provide
notices, seek waivers, amendments or termination of such rights, or seek such
consents), (2) required (upon advice of counsel) by applicable securities or
other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having

announcement.

 



 

Section 17.10 _Rules of Construction_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge that they have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and as such the Parties agree that if an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises hereunder, this Agreement shall
not be construed more strictly against one Party than another on the grounds
of authorship. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and
"hereof," and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular Article, Section, subsection, clause or other
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The word "including" (in its various
forms) means including without limitation. All references to "$" or "dollars"
shall be deemed references to United States dollars. Each accounting term not
defined herein will have the meaning given to it under GAAP as interpreted as
of the date of this Agreement. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, the
word "or" is not exclusive. Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neutral genders
shall be construed to state and include any other gender, and words, terms and
titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be
construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise
requires.

 



 

Section 17.11 _Certain Agreements with Respect to Financing Sources_. Each
Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Related Parties_ ") that the Financing Sources and their Affiliates, and each
of their successors and assigns (i) shall be subject to no liability or claims
(whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) by the Related
Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the Financing, or the
performance of services by such Financing Sources or their Affiliates with
respect to the foregoing and (ii) are express Third Party beneficiaries of
this Section 17.11 (which may not be changed as to any Financing Sources
without its prior written consent).

 



 

Section 17.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as provided in
Sections 14.03 and 14.04 and (ii) for the rights of the Financing Sources
pursuant to Sections 17.07(b), 17.11,

 



      
 

 



 

17.14 and this Section 17.12, nothing in this Agreement shall provide any
benefit to any Third Party or entitle any Third Party to any claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties that
this Agreement shall otherwise not be construed as a Third Party beneficiary
contract; provided that the Financing Sources and their respective current,
former or future directors, officers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or
representatives shall be Third Party beneficiaries of Sections 11.02,
17.07(b), 17.11, 17.12 and 17.14.

 



 

Section 17.13 _Assignment_. No Party may assign or delegate any of its rights
or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Parties and
any assignment made without such consent shall be void. Except as otherwise
provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors, assigns and
legal representatives.

 



 

Section 17.14 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, other documents delivered pursuant hereto and the legal
relations between the Parties shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to principles of
conflicts of laws that would result in the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction, except that (i) with respect to issues relating to real property
for properties located in a specific state, the Laws of that state shall
govern and (ii) matters involving the Financing shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Subject to
Article XVI, the Parties consent to the exercise of jurisdiction _in personam_
by the courts of the State of Texas for any dispute arising under this
Agreement. The Parties agree to venue in Dallas, Texas, including, without
limitation, with respect to any arbitration conducted pursuant to Article XVI
or other dispute arising under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) **THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE IRREVOCABLY ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A
TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR ANY DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR OTHERWISE RELATED HERETO,
INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF**.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 17.14 to the contrary, each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, notice of violation, audit, complaint,
demand, suit, arbitration, mediation, claim, proceeding or investigation
(whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in New York
County, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the federal courts located in the Southern District of New
York (and appellate courts thereof). The provisions of this Section 17.14(c)
shall be enforceable by each Financing Source.

and expressly waives its sovereign immunity for the limited purpose of
