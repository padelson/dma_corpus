consummate a merger (the " _Merger_ ") in which (a) Newco shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Newco shall
thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Minnesota, and (c) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue

##

accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such other place, time and date as
Parent and the Company may agree.

in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of

Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 2.3 _Directors_. The directors of Newco at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving

qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Surviving Corporations Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.

  

## 2.4 _Officers_. The officers of Newco at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the initial officers of the Surviving

# **Article III. Merger Consideration; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares
in the Merger**

  

## 3.1 _Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of
Shares in the Merger_. At the Effective time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Newco, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the holders of any outstanding shares of the Companys Common
Stock (defined in Section 4.2), each share of such Common Stock, together
with the associated right (collectively, the " _Rights_ ") to purchase the
Companys Junior Participating Preferred Stock pursuant to the Rights
Agreement dated as of July 27, 1999, by and between the Company and Wells
Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as Rights Agent (the " _Rights Agreement_ ")
(collectively, the " _Shares_ " and each a " _Share_ ") shall be treated as
follows:

  

### (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and Shares owned by
Parent, Newco or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(collectively, " _Parent Companies_ ") or by any of the Companys direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Newco, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive,
pursuant to Section 3.4, $36.40 per Share in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, without interest thereon,
upon the surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Share.

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding and owned by
any of the Parent Companies or any of the Companys direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
be outstanding, be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and cease to exist.

     

   

### 

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Newco issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

## 3.2 _Stock Options_.

  

(a) Immediately after the Effective Time, each option (" _Option_ ") which
has been granted under the 1990 Stock Plan and the 1999 Stock
Plan (collectively, the " _Option Plans_ ") and is outstanding at the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, will be exchanged for, and
the holder of each such Option will be entitled to receive upon payment of
the per share exercise price of each Option and surrender of the Option for
cancellation or delivery of an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent effecting cancellation of the Option, a lump sum cash payment equal to
the product of the following:

  

#### (i) the Merger Consideration; times

  

#### (ii) the number of Shares covered by such Option.

  

provided that each Option not so exercised and surrendered shall be cancelled
as of the Effective Time and become the right to receive a lump sum payment
equal to the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price times
the number of shares covered by such option.

  

### (b) No party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of any
Option for any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to and in
accordance with any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

(c) Parent shall cause the Company to deduct and withhold from the cash

  

otherwise payable to the holder of any Option pursuant to this Section 3.2,
such amounts as the Company reasonably and in good faith determines are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Option holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Company.

  

## 3.3 _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Board of
Directors, shall:

  

### (a) use all reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a proxy statement which
meets the applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") for the purposes of considering and taking
action upon this Agreement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and obtain and furnish
the information required to be included by it in the Proxy Statement and
respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and any preliminary version thereof and obtain SEC clearance of the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall allow Parent reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement and all amendments and supplements
thereto;

     

   

### 

  

### (b) include in the Proxy Statement (as defined above) the recommendation
of the Board of Directors that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of
the approval of this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of Directors may withdraw, modify
or amend its recommendation if the Board of Directors after consultation with
its counsel and financial advisers, determines such recommendation would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders
under applicable law, in which case any such withdrawal, modification or
amendment shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement;

  

### (c) the Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to
Parent and shall use its reasonable efforts to otherwise solicit proxies in
connection with the shareholders meeting unless the Board of Directors of the
Company, after receiving a bona fide unsolicited Superior Competing
Transaction (as defined in Section 6.2 below) and after consulting with its
legal and financial advisors, determines that to do so would result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

  

### (d) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
shareholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ "), to be held as soon as practicable
following filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and the completion of
the SECs review of the Proxy Statement, unless the Board of Directors of the
Company, after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited Superior Competing
Transaction and after consulting with its legal and financial advisors,
determines that to do so would result in a breach in its fiduciary duties
under applicable law;

  

### (e) the Company shall distribute the Proxy Statement to participants in
the Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_ ") to the extent
required by applicable law. The Company shall vote all Shares in the ESOP
which are unallocated to approve and adopt the Merger and the transactions to
be consummated thereby.

  

At such meeting, Parent and Newco and any Person which owns more than 30%
of Parent will vote all Shares, if any, owned by them in favor of approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## 3.4 _Payment for Shares in the Merger_. The manner of making payment for
Shares in the Merger shall be as follows:

  

### (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit
of the holders of Shares and Options the funds necessary to make the payments
contemplated by Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively (the " _Payment Fund_ ").
The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the
payments contemplated by Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, out of the
Payment Fund in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.4(c) below.

  

### (b) The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent
or Newco in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America,
in commercial paper obligations rated A- 1 or P- 1 or better by Moodys
Investor Services or Standard and Poors

     

   

### 

  

### Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$200 million, in each case with maturities not exceeding seven days.
Parent shall cause the Payment Fund to be promptly replenished to the extent
of any losses incurred as a result of the aforementioned investments. All
earnings thereon shall inure to the benefit of Parent. If for any reason
(including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which
holders of Shares shall be entitled under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and this
Section 3.3, Parent shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided
in this Agreement.

  

### (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record (other than holders of
certificates representing Dissenting Shares and for Shares referred to in
Section 3.1(b)) of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
(i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for
payment therefor. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and any
other required documents, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled
to receive for each of the Shares represented by such Certificates the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, less any required withholding of
taxes, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

  

### (d) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name a Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.4, each Certificate (other
than certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Shares referred to in
Section 3.1(b)) shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive,
for each Share represented thereby, the Merger Consideration. If any such
Certificates or Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact and customary indemnification against
loss by the Person claiming such Certificate or Certificates, the Paying
Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
(subject to any required withholding of taxes by the Surviving Corporation)
the applicable Merger Consideration in respect thereof upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of such affidavit and indemnification against loss.

  

### (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Paying Agent
which remains unclaimed by the former shareholders and option holders of the
Company for six months after the Effective Time, together with any interest
earnings and other income related to the Payment Fund, shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former shareholders and option holders
of the Company shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration for the Shares.

     

   

### 

  

### (f) Neither the Paying Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be
liable to any shareholder of the Company for any Shares, the Merger
Consideration or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to and in
accordance with any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

### (g) The Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any shareholder
of the Company such amounts as the Company reasonably and in good faith
determines are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code (as defined below), or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the shareholder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent.

  

## 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has demanded
payment for such shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of
the MBCA, if such Sections provide for dissenters rights for such Shares in
the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1, unless and
until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses the right
to dissent and demand payment under the MBCA. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses the right to demand
payment, then such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without
interest or dividends thereon, and such Shares shall no longer be Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any notice received by
the Company of intent to dissent and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notice. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, with any such holder.

  

## 3.6 _No Further Rights or Transfers_. Except for the surrender of the
Certificates representing the Shares in exchange for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration with respect to each Share or the perfection of
dissenters rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares, at and after the
Effective Time, the holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights as a
shareholder of the Company, and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be
made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 3.7 _Certain Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by Article III of this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule

Minnesota law or U.S. federal law apply to this Agreement or the Merger or

below). The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or
any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of, the
Company or any Subsidiary to (i) solicit or initiate, encourage, or
facilitate, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, or the
submission of, any proposal or offer, whether in writing or otherwise, from
any Person other than Parent, Newco or any Affiliates thereof (a " _Third
Party_ ") to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) of all or more than 20% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of stock, sale of assets, tender offer,
exchange offer or similar transaction or series of related transactions,

Company (a " _Competing Transaction_ "); (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data
with respect to or access to the properties of, or take any other action to
knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction; or (iii) enter
into any agreement with respect to any Competing Transaction, approve or
recommend or resolve to approve or recommend any Competing Transaction or
enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Company receives a
bona fide, written proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction by a Third
Party, which the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consulting the Board of Directors independent financial advisor) (A)
is reasonably likely to result in terms which are more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of Shares than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) is reasonably
capable of being consummated (provided that the Company, including the Board
of Directors, and any of its advisors shall be permitted to contact such
Third Party and its advisors solely for the purpose of clarifying the
proposal and any material contingencies and the capability of consummation)(a
" _Superior Competing Transaction_ "), then the Company may, in response to
an unsolicited request therefor and subject to compliance with Section
6.2(b), furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, and participate in discussions and negotiations directly or through
its representatives with, such Third Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not provide any non-public information to any such Third
Party unless the Company provides such non-public information pursuant to
a nondisclosure agreement with terms that are at least as restrictive as
those pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) and
concurrently provides such information to Newco. The Company shall be
permitted to waive the provisions of any "standstill" agreement between the
Company and a Third Party to the extent necessary to permit such Third Party
to submit a Competing Transaction that the Board of Directors believes, in
its good faith judgment, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Competing Transaction. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule l4e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its shareholders
required by applicable law, rule or regulation or by the rules of the
American Stock Exchange.

  

### (b) The Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any
proposal for a Competing Transaction received by any officer or director of
the Company or, to the

     

   

### 

  

Knowledge of the Company, any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or
representative of the Company and (ii) the material terms of such Competing
Transaction (but shall not be obligated to disclose the identity of the
entity proposing the Competing Transaction). The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of, and any material changes to, the terms
of any such Competing Transaction proposal in a timely manner.

arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
