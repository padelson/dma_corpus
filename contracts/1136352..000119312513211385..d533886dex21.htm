to be treated as a single employer together with the CMLP Parties under
Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code has any liability (whether
secondary, contingent or otherwise) with respect to an Employee Benefit Plan
that (i) is subject to Title IV of ERISA or the minimum funding requirements
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA; (ii) is a multiemployer

of the Code); or (iii) provides for any post-employment welfare benefits or
coverage, except as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Code Section 4980B (or similar state or local law).

 

(c) Except as would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a CMLP
Material Adverse Effect:

 

(i) the CMLP Party Employee Benefit Plans (A) have been established and
maintained (in form and in operation) in accordance with their terms and with
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and (B) if intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, are so qualified and have received
a favorable determination letter as to their qualification, or if such plan
is a prototype plan, an opinion or notification letter and nothing has
occurred, whether by action or failure to act that could reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of such qualification;

 

(ii) each CMLP Group Entity and each entity employing or engaging current or
former CMLP Related Employees is, and has been, in compliance in all respects
with all applicable Law relating to the employment of labor, including all
such applicable Law relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health and workers compensation;

(iii) no event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject a CMLP
Group Entity either directly or by reason of their affiliation with any
company or other entity that is required to be treated as a single employer
together with CMLP under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code to any
Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or
other applicable Laws;

timely made or, if applicable, accrued to the extent required by GAAP;

(v) each CMLP Party Employee Benefit Plan maintained or sponsored by a CMLP
Group Entity can be unilaterally amended or terminated at any time by a CMLP
Group Entity without liability other than liability for benefits accrued to
the date of such amendment or termination pursuant to the terms of the plan;

(vi) there are no actions, suits, or claims pending (other than routine

respect to, any of the CMLP Party Employee Benefit Plans and no facts or
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such actions, suits or claims; and

(vii) there is no administrative investigation, audit or other administrative
proceeding pending (other than routine qualification determination filings)
or, to the knowledge of CH, threatened, with respect to any of the CMLP Party
Employee Benefit Plans by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental
agency.

 

(d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, either alone or in combination
with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former director or current or
former CMLP Related Employee to any retirement, severance, change of control,
unemployment compensation or any other payment or enhanced or accelerated
benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due any such director or CMLP Related Employee, or
result in any limitation on the right of the CMLP Group Entities and their
Affiliates to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from
any CMLP Party Employee Benefit Plan or related trust, (iii) result in any
payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to
any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1) with respect to an CMLP Group Entity or its Affiliates that
could reasonably be construed, individually or in combination with any other
such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) or (iv) result in the funding of any "rabbi"
or similar trust pursuant to any CMLP Employee Benefit Plan. No CMLP Employee
Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under

years. There is no unfair labor practice charge pending or, to the knowledge
of CH, threatened against any CMLP Group Entity.

(f) The CMLP Parties do not (i) employ and, have not at any time employed, any
employees or (ii) retain, and have not at any time retained, the services of
any independent contractors.

Section 3.09  _Inspections; No Other Representations_. Each Contributing
Party is an informed and sophisticated party, and has engaged expert advisors,
experienced in the evaluation and investment in the Consideration and
companies such as NRGY as contemplated hereunder. Each Contributing Party has
undertaken a sufficient investigation to enable it to make an informed and
intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement. CH, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, agrees
to accept the Consideration on the Closing Date based upon its own inspection,
examination and determination with respect thereto as to all matters and
without reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of
any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to the Recipient Parties, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Contributing Parties acknowledge that the Recipient
Parties make no representation or warranty with respect to (i) any
projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to the
Recipient Parties of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the NRGY Common Units that compose the Consideration or
the future business and operations of NRGY and its Subsidiaries or (ii) any
other information or documents made available to the Recipient Parties or
their counsel, accountants or advisors with respect to the NRGY Common Units
that compose the Consideration or NRGY and its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses or operations, except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

Section 3.10 _Litigation_. There is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending against or, to the knowledge of CH, threatened (including
any cease and desist letter and invitation to take a license) against the CMLP
Parties or any of their properties, assets, operations or business before any
Governmental Authority, except for any such action, suit, investigation or
proceeding (i) arising after the date of this Agreement that challenges or
seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or (ii) would not reasonably be expected to constitute, individually
or in the aggregate, a CMLP Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.11 _Investment Representation_. The Contributing Parties are
purchasing the Consideration for their own account with the present intention
of holding the underlying NRGY Common Units comprising the Consideration for
investment purposes and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any
public distribution of such units in violation of any federal or state
securities laws. The Contributing Parties acknowledge that such NRGY Common
Units have not been registered under federal and state securities laws and
that such NRGY Common Units may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such transfer, sale,
assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is registered under
federal and state securities laws or pursuant to an exemption from
registration under any federal or state securities laws.

 



19 Section 3.12 _Compliance with Laws and Court Orders_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in Section
3.15), Environmental Law (which is provided for in Section 3.19) and employee
benefit matters (which are provided for in Section 3.08) CMLP and each of the
CMLP Group Entities is in compliance with all, and is not in default under or
in violation of, applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default or
violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an
CMLP Material Adverse Effect. No CMLP Group Entity has received any written
communication within the past two years from a Governmental Authority that
alleges that any CMLP Group Entity is not in compliance with or is in default
or violation of any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default
or violation would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, an CMLP
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The CMLP Group Entities are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary under applicable Law to
own, lease and operate their properties and to lawfully carry on their
businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the " _CMLP
Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such CMLP Permits
would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an CMLP Material
Adverse Effect. None of the CMLP Group Entities in default or violation of
any of the CMLP Permits, except for any such defaults or violations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an CMLP Material Adverse
Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the CMLP Permits is pending
or, to the knowledge of CH, threatened, except where such suspension or
cancellation would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, an CMLP
Material Adverse Effect. As of the Execution Date, to the knowledge of CH,
no event or condition has occurred or exists which would result in a
violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of
an obligation of the CMLP Group Entities under, any CMLP Permit, or has caused
(or would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to
issue, renew or extend any CMLP Permit (in each case, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses,
accelerations or failures that would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, an CMLP Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.13 _Affiliated Transaction_. Except as set forth on Section 3.13 of
the Contributing Party Disclosure Schedules, no current or former officer,
director, employee, equity holder or Affiliate of the Contributing Parties or
of the CMLP Parties or any individual in such officers, directors,
employees or equity holders immediate family is a party to any agreement,
Contract, commitment or transaction with any of the CMLP Parties and their
controlled Affiliates. Neither of the Contributing Parties nor any of their
Affiliates (other than controlled Affiliates of Gas Services GP) own any
assets that are used in the business of CMLP or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.14 _Commitment Letters_. The Contributing Parties have delivered to
the Recipient Parties true and complete copies of the executed commitment
letter, dated as of the date hereof by and among CH and the Financing Sources
regarding the terms and conditions of

 



20  the financing to be provided by such commitment letter attached hereto as
Exhibit B (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments thereto and each such fee letter and engagement letter,
collectively, the " _CH Commitment Letters_ "). The CH Commitment Letters have
been duly executed and delivered by CH and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the other parties thereto, constitute a
legal, valid and binding agreement of CH enforceable against CH in accordance
with their terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)) and, to the knowledge of CH,
and are not subject to any conditions precedent related to the funding of the
net proceeds of the Debt Financing that are not set forth in the CH Commitment
Letters. The CH Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified prior to
the date hereof and the respective commitments contained in the CH Commitment
Letters have not been reduced, withdrawn or rescinded prior to the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, the Contributing Parties are not aware of any
event that has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach by CH under any term or condition of the
CH Commitment Letters, and, as of the date hereof, the Contributing Parties
have no reason to believe that CH or any other party thereto will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any of the conditions to the Debt Financing to be
satisfied pursuant to the CH Commitment Letters. CH or an Affiliate thereof on
its behalf has fully paid any and all commitment or other fees required
by the CH Commitment Letters to be paid by the date hereof.

Section 3.15 _Tax Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in the

Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise;

(j) in each tax year since the formation of CMLP up to and including the

since its formation, treated as a disregarded entity; and

(l) except for Crestwood Midstream Finance Corporation, none of the CMLP Group
Entities is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.

Section 3.16 _Financial Statements_. The historical financial statements of
CMLP included in the CMLP SEC Documents, including all related notes and
schedules (the " _CMLP Financial Statements_ "): (i) comply as to form in all
material respects with the Securities Act, Exchange Act and applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto; (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of CMLP and the CMLP Subsidiaries, as of the
respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows and changes in partners equity of the entities to which such CMLP
Financial Statements relate for the periods indicated; and (iii) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the

Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K, forms, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be

 



22  filed or furnished by CMLP with or to the SEC, as applicable, pursuant to
the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the " _CMLP SEC Documents_ "), have
been timely filed or furnished in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the SEC. All such CMLP SEC Documents (i) complied as to form in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) as of its filing date in the case of any Exchange Act
report and as of its effective date in the case of any Securities Act filing,
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the Execution Date, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the CMLP SEC
Documents. To the knowledge of CH, none of the CMLP SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) CMLP has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. CMLPs disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by CMLP in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to CMLPs
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). CMLPs management has
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of CMLPs internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2012, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. To knowledge of CH, it has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluations, to CMLPs outside auditors
and the audit committee of the CMLP Board (i) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect CMLPs
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the CMLPs internal controls over financial reporting.

Section 3.18 _Material Contracts_.

(a) Except for those agreements filed as exhibits to the CMLP SEC Documents
and those agreements set forth on Section 3.20(a) of the Contributor Party
Disclosure Schedules (collectively, the " _CMLP Material Agreements_ "), none

for borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of property (in either
case, whether incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by any asset) in excess
of $10,000,000;

 

(iii) which contains any provision that prior to or following the date hereof

without payment by such CMLP Group Entity of any material penalty;

 

(v) which is an agreement for the purchase of materials, supplies, goods,
services, equipment or other assets that in each case both (A) cannot be

(vi) which is a partnership, joint venture or other similar agreement or
arrangement;

collar or other similar hedging or derivate transactions, other than any
contract for purchase and sale of commodities and the associated hedging
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice;

 

(viii) which is a contract relating to the acquisition or disposition of any
business or assets (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or
otherwise) with a purchase price of $10,000,000 or more;

transportation, storage, sale or purchase of natural gas, condensate or other

in excess of $10,000,000; or

(x) any contract relating to the construction of capital assets or other
capital expenditures in each case that involves annual revenues or payments in
excess of $10,000,000.

 

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
Creditors Rights; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any indemnity,
contribution and

 



24  exoneration provisions contained in any such CMLP Material Agreement may be
limited by applicable Law and public policy, each of the CMLP Material
Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the applicable
CMLP Group Entity, and to the knowledge of CH constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the other parties thereto (ii) is in full force and effect as of
the date hereof and (iii) will be in full force and effect upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
unless the failure to be so would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, an CMLP Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) There is not, to the knowledge of CH, under any CMLP Material Agreement,
any default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, except such
events of default and other events as to which requisite waivers or consents
have been obtained or which would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a CMLP Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.19 _Environmental Matters_. Except as reflected in the CMLP
Financial Statements, and except for any such matter that individually or in
the aggregate would not constitute a CMLP Material Adverse Effect:

(a) each of the CMLP Group Entities and its assets, real properties and
operations are in compliance with all Environmental Law and Environmental
Permits;

 

(b) each of the CMLP Group Entities has, as applicable, developed and
submitted or obtained and maintained all Environmental Permits necessary for
the conduct and operation of its business as currently conducted and operated,
and all such Environmental Permits are in full force and effect and to the
knowledge of CH, there is no pending or threatened challenge to any
Environmental Permit or reason to believe any pending application for any
Environmental Permit will not be approved in reasonably acceptable form and
substance;

 

(c) none of the CMLP Group Entities has received any written notice from any
Person alleging with respect to any of the CMLP Group Entities, the violation
of or liability under any Environmental Law (including liability as a
potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any analogous state laws) or any
Environmental Permit, and to the knowledge of CH, no occurrence or condition
exists that would reasonably be expected to result in the receipt of such
notice;

(d) there has been no Release of any Hazardous Material at, on, under or from
any real properties or facilities as a result of the operations of the CMLP
Group Entities that has not been remediated as required by any Environmental
Law or Environmental Permit or otherwise adequately reserved for in the CMLP
Financial Statements and to the knowledge of CH, there is no occurrence or
condition relating to any such Release that would reasonably be expected to
result in any of the CMLP Group Entities having liability under any
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit; and

(e) the CMLP Group Entities have provided or otherwise made available to the
Buyer Group Entities true and complete copies of all material written
environmental assessment reports that have been prepared by or on behalf of
the CMLP Group Entities and that are in any of the CMLP Group Entities
possession.

 



25 This Section 3.19, and Sections 3.04, 3.07, 3.18 and 3.21 hereof, constitute
the sole and exclusive representation and warranty of the CMLP Parties with
respect to Environmental Permits, the Release of or exposure to Hazardous
Materials and Environmental Law.

Section 3.20 _Title to Properties and Rights of Way_.

 

(a) Each of the CMLP Group Entities has indefeasible title to all material
real property and good title to all material tangible personal property owned
by such CMLP Group Entity, in each case which is material to the business of
such CMLP Group Entity, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute CMLP
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of the CMLP Group Entities owns or has the right to use
such consents, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from each Person
(collectively, " _rights-of-way_ ") as are necessary to conduct its business
in the manner described in the CMLP SEC Reports, except for such rights-of-way
the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in
an CMLP Material Adverse Effect. Each such right-of-way is valid and
enforceable, except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law), and grant the rights
purported to be granted thereby and all rights necessary thereunder for the
current operation of the businesses of the CMLP Group Entities, except where
the failure of any such right-of-way to be valid or enforceable or to grant
the rights purported to be granted thereby or necessary thereunder would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a CMLP Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the CMLP Group Entities has fulfilled and performed all its material
obligations with respect to such rights-of-way and, to the knowledge of CH,
no event has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would
allow, revocation or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of
the rights of the holder of any such rights-of-way, except for any failure to
fulfill or perform or any such revocations, terminations and impairments that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a CMLP Material Adverse
Effect; and no such rights-of-way contain any restriction that materially
prevents the operation of the businesses of the CMLP Group Entities, taken as
a whole, and as currently conducted.

(c) There is no pending (or, to the knowledge of CH, threatened) condemnation
of any material part of the real property used and necessary for the conduct
of the businesses of the CMLP Group Entities, as they are presently
conducted, by any Governmental Authority or other Person.

Section 3.21 _Insurance_. The CMLP Group Entities own, hold, maintain, or are
entitled to the benefits of, insurance covering their properties, operations,
personnel and businesses in amounts required by applicable Law and customary
for the businesses in which they operate. 

 



26  The CMLP Group Entities are in compliance with the terms of all insurance
policies in all material respects; and there are no material claims by any of
the CMLP Group Entities under any such insurance policy as to which any
insurance company is denying liability or defending under a reservation of
rights clause. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute a CMLP Material Adverse Effect, none of the CMLP Group Entities
has received any written notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that
such insurer has cancelled or terminated or has initiated procedures to cancel
or terminate any insurance policy.

 

Section 3.22 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2012 through the
date hereof, no events, changes, effects or developments have occurred that
have had or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a CMLP Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.23 _Regulation_. None of the CMLP Group Entities is, nor will any of
the CMLP Group Entities be following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, an "investment company" or a company "controlled by" an
"investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

Section 3.24 _Intellectual Property_. CMLP and the CMLP Subsidiaries own or
have the right to use all other Intellectual Property necessary for the
operation of the businesses of each of CMLP and the CMLP Subsidiaries as
presently conducted (collectively, the " _CMLP Intellectual Property_ "), free
and clear of all Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where
the failure to own or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would
not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a CMLP Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of CH, (i) the use of the CMLP Intellectual Property
by CMLP and the CMLP Subsidiaries and the operation of the business of each

knowledge of NRGY GP, threatened. NRGY is duly qualified to do business as a

the Recipient Parties of (i) this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the NRGM Common Unit Distribution,
are within the Recipient Parties powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate (or similar) action on the part of the Recipient Parties
and no other action is necessary on the part of the Recipient Parties or any
of their Affiliates for the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by NRGY and/or NRGY GP, as

filing or notification by either Recipient Party or any NRGY Group Entity with
any Governmental Authority other than (i) compliance with any applicable

Robinson Humphrey Inc., there is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on

the transactions contemplated hereby, including the NRGM Common Unit
Distribution and the Follow-On Contributions, and the purchase of the
Partnership Interests (as

 



29  such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement) pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, do not and will not (i) violate or conflict with the Organizational
Documents of NRGY or NRGY GP, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 4.03, violate or conflict with any Law, (iii) require
any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default under,
result in a violation of or conflict with, or give rise to any right of

Contributing Parties true and complete copies of the executed commitment
letter, dated as of the date hereof by and among NRGY and the Financing

including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto and each
such fee letter and engagement letter, collectively, the " _NRGY Commitment
Letters_ "). The NRGY Commitment Letters have been duly executed and
delivered by NRGY and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the other parties thereto, constitute a legal, valid and binding
agreement of NRGY enforceable against NRGY in accordance with their terms
(except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law)) and, to the knowledge of the NRGY GP are not
subject to any conditions precedent related to the funding of the net proceeds
of the Debt Financing that are not set forth in the NRGY Commitment Letters.
The NRGY Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified prior to the
date hereof and the respective commitments contained in the NRGY Commitment
Letters have not been reduced, withdrawn or rescinded prior to the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, the Recipient Parties are not aware of any
event that has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach by NRGY under any term or condition of
the NRGY Commitment Letters, and, as of the date hereof, the Recipient
Parties have no reason to believe that NRGY or any other party thereto will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing to be satisfied pursuant to the NRGY Commitment Letters. NRGY or an
Affiliate thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all commitment or other
fees required by the NRGY Commitment Letters to be paid by the date hereof.

7.12 of the NRGY Partnership Agreement.

with respect thereto; (ii) fairly present in all material respects the

normal year-end adjustments.

Section 4.11 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Neither NRGY nor any of the NRGY Group Entities has any indebtedness or
liability, absolute or contingent, which is of a nature required to be
reflected on the balance sheet of NRGY or in the notes thereto, in each case
prepared in conformity with GAAP, and which is not shown or reserved against
on the NRGY Financial Statements, other than:

 

(i) liabilities incurred or accrued in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since September 30, 2012, including liens for
current Taxes and assessments not in default;

(ii) liabilities of NRGY or any of the NRGY Group Entities that, individually
or in the aggregate, are not material to NRGY and the NRGY Group Entities,
taken as a whole; or

(iii) liabilities that have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date

(b) Neither NRGY nor any of the NRGY Group Entities is a party to, or has any

relating to any transaction or relationship between or among NRGY and any of
the NRGY Group Entities, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, NRGY in NRGYs published financial statements or
any NRGY SEC Reports.

 



31 Section 4.12 _NRGY SEC Reports and Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Since September 30, 2010, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K, forms, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by NRGY with or to the SEC, as applicable,
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the " _NRGY SEC Reports_
") have been timely filed or furnished in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the SEC. All such NRGY SEC Reports (i) complied as to form in
all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (ii) as of its filing date in the case of any Exchange Act
report and as of its effective date in the case of any Securities Act
filing, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. As of the Execution Date, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the NRGY SEC Reports. To the knowledge of NRGY GP, none of the NRGY SEC
Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

(b) NRGY has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. NRGYs disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by NRGY in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to NRGYs management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. NRGYs management has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of NRGYs internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended September 30, 2012, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the knowledge of NRGY GP, NRGY has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluations, to NRGYs outside auditors and the audit
committee of the NRGY Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect NRGYs ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the NRGYs internal controls over financial reporting.

Section 4.13 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in Section
4.19), Environmental Law (which is provided for in Section 4.16) and employee
benefit matters (which are provided for in Section 4.20) NRGY and each of the
NRGY Group Entities is in compliance with all, and is not in default under or
in violation of, applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default or
violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an
NRGY Material Adverse Effect. No NRGY Group Entity

 



32  has received any written communication within the past two years from a
Governmental Authority that alleges that any NRGY Group Entity is not in
compliance with or is in default or violation of any applicable Law, except
where such non-compliance, default or violation would not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, an NRGY Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The NRGY Group Entities are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary under applicable Law to
own, lease and operate their properties and to lawfully carry on their
businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the " _NRGY
Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such NRGY Permits
would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an NRGY Material
Adverse Effect. None of the NRGY Group Entities in default or violation
of any of the NRGY Permits, except for any such defaults or violations that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an NRGY Material
Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the NRGY Permits is
pending or, to the knowledge of NRGY GP, threatened, except where such
suspension or cancellation would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, an NRGY Material Adverse Effect. As of the Execution Date, to the
knowledge of NRGY GP, no event or condition has occurred or exists which
would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or
acceleration of an obligation of the NRGY Group Entities under, any NRGY
Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority
to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend any NRGY Permit (in each case,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both), except for violations,
breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or failures that would not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, an NRGY Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 4.14 _Material Contracts_.

 

(a) Except for those agreements filed as exhibits to the NRGY SEC Reports and
those agreements set forth on Section 4.14(a) of the Recipient Party
Disclosure Schedules (collectively, the " _NRGY Material Agreements_ "), none
of the NRGY Group Entities is a party to, or is bound by, any agreements,
contracts or commitments (whether written or oral):

601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC);

borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of property (in either case,
whether incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by any asset) in excess of
$10,000,000;

 

(iii) which contains any provision that prior to or following the date hereof
would materially restrict or alter the conduct of business of, or purport to
materially restrict or alter the conduct of business of, whether or not
binding on, NRGY or any controlled Affiliate of NRGY, including by materially
restricting the disposition of any business or assets; 

 



33 (iv) which is a lease or license (whether of real, personal or
intangible property) providing for annual rentals or fees of $5,000,000 or
more that cannot be terminated by any NRGY Group Entity on not more than 60
days notice without payment by such NRGY Group Entity of any material
penalty;

 

(v) which is an agreement for the purchase of materials, supplies, goods,
services, equipment or other assets that in each case both (A) cannot be
terminated by any NRGY Group Entity on not more than 60 days notice without
payment by any of NRGY Group Entity of any material penalty and (B) involves
annual revenues or payments in excess of $10,000,000; 

(vi) which is a partnership, joint venture or other similar agreement or
arrangement;

 

(vii) any contract that relates to any commodity or interest rate swap, cap or
collar or other similar hedging or derivate transactions, other than any
contract for purchase and sale of commodities and the associated hedging
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice;

 

(viii) which is a contract relating to the acquisition or disposition of any
business or assets (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or
otherwise) with a purchase price of $10,000,000 or more;

(ix) any contract relating to the gathering, processing, treating,
transportation, storage, sale or purchase of natural gas, condensate or other
liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons or the products therefrom, or the provision of
services related thereto (including any operation, operation servicing or
maintenance contract) in each case that involves annual revenues or payments
in excess of $10,000,000; or

(x) any contract relating to the construction of capital assets or other
capital expenditures in each case that involves annual revenues or payments in
excess of $10,000,000.

 

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
Creditors Rights; and _provided, further_ , that any indemnity, contribution
and exoneration provisions contained in any such NRGY Material Agreement may
be limited by applicable Law and public policy, each of the NRGY Material
Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the applicable
NRGY Group Entity and, to the knowledge of NRGY GP, constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the other parties thereto, (ii) is in full force and
effect as of the date hereof, and (iii) will be in full force and effect upon
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case unless the failure to be so would not constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, an NRGY Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) There is not, to the knowledge of NRGY GP, under any NRGY Material
Agreement, any default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, except
such events of default and other events as to which requisite waivers or
consents have been obtained or which would not reasonably be expected
to constitute, individually or in the aggregate, an NRGY Material Adverse
Effect.

 



34 Section 4.15 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no pending (or to the
knowledge of NRGY GP, threatened) Proceedings, with respect to which any NRGY
Group Entity has been contacted in writing by counsel for the plaintiff or
claimant, against or affecting any NRGY Group Entity or any of their
properties, assets, operations or business and which constitute, individually
or in the aggregate, an NRGY Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not
individually constitute an NRGY Material Adverse Effect, none of the NRGY
Group Entities is a party or subject to or in default under any order,
injunction, judgment, decree, ruling or other similar requirement applicable
to it or any of its properties, assets, operations or business.

Section 4.16 _Environmental Matters_. Except as reflected in the NRGY
Financial Statements, and except for any such matter that would not
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, an NRGY Material Adverse
Effect:

(a) each of the NRGY Group Entities and its assets, real properties
and operations are in compliance with all Environmental Law and Environmental
Permits;

(b) each of the NRGY Group Entities has, as applicable, developed and
submitted or obtained and maintained all Environmental Permits necessary for
the conduct and operation of its business as currently conducted and operated,
and all such Environmental Permits are in full force and effect and to the
knowledge of NRGY GP, there is no pending or threatened challenge to any
Environmental Permit or reason to believe any pending application for any
Environmental Permit will not be approved in reasonably acceptable form and
substance;

(c) none of the NRGY Group Entities has received any written notice from any
Person alleging, with respect to any of the NRGY Group Entities, the
violation of or liability under any Environmental Law (including liability as
a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any analogous state laws) or
any Environmental Permit, and to the knowledge of NRGY GP, no occurrence or
condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in the receipt of
such notice;

(d) there has been no Release of any Hazardous Material at, on, under or from
any real properties or facilities as a result of the operations of the NRGY
Group Entities that has not been remediated as required by any Environmental
Law or Environmental Permit or otherwise adequately reserved for in the NRGY
Financial Statements and to the knowledge of NRGY GP, there is no occurrence
or condition relating to any such Release that would reasonably be expected
to result in any of the NRGY Group Entities having liability under any
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit; and

(e) the NRGY Group Entities have provided or otherwise made available to the
Contributing Parties true and complete copies of all material written
environmental assessment reports that have been prepared by or on behalf of
the NRGY Group Entities and that are in any of the NRGY Group Entities
possession.

 



35 This Section 4.16, and Sections 4.06, 4.11, 4.14 and 4.18 hereof, constitute
the sole and exclusive representation and warranty of the Recipient Parties
with respect to Environmental Permits, the Release or exposure to Hazardous
Materials and Environmental Law.

 

Section 4.17 _Title to Properties and Rights of Way_.

 

(a) Each of the NRGY Group Entities has indefeasible title to all material
real property and good title to all material tangible personal property owned
by such NRGY Group Entity, in each case which is material to the business of
such NRGY Group Entity, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an NRGY
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of the NRGY Group Entities owns or has the right to use consents,
easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from each Person (collectively,
" _rights-of-way_ ") as are necessary to conduct its business in the manner
described in the NRGY SEC Reports, except for such rights-of-way the absence
of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in an NRGY
Material Adverse Effect. Each such right-of-way is valid and enforceable,
except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
Proceeding in equity or at law), and grant the rights purported to be granted
thereby and all rights necessary thereunder for the current operation of the
businesses of the NRGY Group Entities, except where the failure of any such
right-of-way to be valid or enforceable or to grant the rights purported to
be granted thereby or necessary thereunder would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in an Material Adverse Effect. Each of the NRGY Group
Entities has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations
with respect to such rights-of-way and, to the knowledge of NRGY GP, no event
has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow,
revocation or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the
rights of the holder of any such rights-of-way, except any failure to fulfill
or perform any for such revocations, terminations and impairments that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, result in an NRGY Material Adverse
Effect; and no such rights-of-way contain any restriction that materially
prevents the operation of the businesses of the NRGY Group Entities, taken as
a whole, and as currently conducted.

(c) There is no pending (or, to the knowledge of NRGY GP, threatened)
condemnation of any material part of the real property used and necessary for
the conduct of the businesses of the NRGY Group Entities, as they are
presently conducted, by any Governmental Authority or other Person.

 



36 Section 4.18 _Insurance_. The NRGY Group Entities own, hold maintain, or
are entitled to the benefits of, insurance covering their properties,
operations, personnel and businesses in amounts required by applicable Law and

are in compliance with the terms of all insurance policies in all material
respects; and there are no material claims by any of the NRGY Group Entities
under any such insurance policy as to which any insurance company is denying
liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute an NRGY Material Adverse
Effect, none of the NRGY Group Entities has received any written notice from
any insurer or agent of such insurer that such insurer has cancelled or
terminated or has initiated procedures to cancel or terminate any insurance
policy.

Section 4.19 _Tax Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in the

that have had or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the

have the right to use all other Intellectual Property necessary for the
operation of the businesses of each of NRGY and the NRGY Group Entities as
presently conducted (collectively, the " _NRGY Intellectual Property_ "), free

to own or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute an NRGY Material Adverse Effect.
To the knowledge of NRGY GP, (i) the use of the NRGY Intellectual Property by
NRGY and the NRGY Group Entities and the operation of the business of each of
NRGY and the NRGY Group Entities as presently conducted does not infringe or
misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any other Person, (ii) no

reasonably protect the operation and security of their material software and

the foregoing, each Recipient Party acknowledges that the Contributing Parties
make no representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections,

claim, notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact. The Tax
Indemnifying Party shall control all decisions with respect to any Tax
Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnified Party
shall take such action (including settlement with respect to such Tax
Proceeding or the prosecution of such Tax Proceeding to a determination in a
court or other tribunal of initial or appellate jurisdiction) in connection
with a Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax Claim as the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request in writing from time to time,
including the selection of counsel and experts and the execution of powers of
attorney; provided, however, that (i) within 30 days after the notice
required by Section 7.09(b) has been delivered (or such earlier date that any
payment of Taxes with respect to such claim is due but in no event sooner than
five days after the Tax Indemnifying Partys receipt of such notice), the Tax
Indemnifying Party requests that such claim be contested, and (ii) if the Tax
Indemnified Party is requested by the Tax Indemnifying Party to pay the Tax
claimed and sue for a refund, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have advanced
to the Tax Indemnified Party, on an interest-free basis, the amount of such
claim. The Tax Indemnified Party shall not make any payment of an Indemnified
Tax Claim for at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required by
Law) after the giving of the notice required by Section 7.09(d) with respect
to such claim, shall give to the Tax Indemnifying Party any information
requested related to such claim, and otherwise shall cooperate with the Tax
Indemnifying Party in order to contest effectively any such claim.

(e) Scope. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent any
other provision of this Agreement conflicts with this Section 7.09 with
respect to any claims relating to Taxes (including any claims relating to
representations respecting Tax matters including Section 3.15 and Section
4.19), this Section 7.09 shall govern; provided that the limitations set forth
in the proviso of each of Section 10.02(a) and Section 10.02(b), as
applicable, shall apply to any such claims as if such claims were brought as
a Warranty Breach pursuant to such Section. No claim may be made or brought by
any Party hereto after the expiration of the applicable survival period unless
such claim has been asserted by written notice specifying the details
supporting the claim on or prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period. The rights under this Section 7.09 shall survive the Closing until 30
days after the expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions)
applicable to such Tax matter; provided that any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 7.09(c) shall survive the time at which it would

 



48  otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences, if proper notice of
such right of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such
indemnity may be sought prior to such time.

Section 7.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of the Recipient Parties, with respect to the NRGY Commitment Letter
and the Debt Financing contemplated thereby, and the Contributing Parties,

arrange the applicable Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the applicable Commitment Letter, including using their commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the applicable Commitment

notify the other and use their commercially reasonable efforts to amend,
modify, supplement, alter, restate, substitute or replace the applicable Debt

amendment, modification, supplement, alteration, restatement, substitution or
replacement of the NRGY Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing related
thereto or permit the terms of any definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing to deviate from the terms of the NRGY Commitment Letter,
without the prior consent of the Contributing Parties, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In such event, the term " _NRGY
Commitment Letter_ " or " _CW Commitment Letter_ ", as applicable, as used
herein shall be deemed to include the amended, modified, supplemented,
altered, restated, substituted or replacement, commitment letter and the term
Debt Financing shall be deemed to include the financing contemplated thereby.

event within two Business Days) notify the other: (i) of any default or breach
by any party to the applicable Commitment Letter or definitive documents
related to the applicable Debt Financing of which such Party is aware; (ii) of
the receipt of any written notice from any party to the applicable Commitment
Letter with respect to (x) any default, breach, termination or repudiation by

to the applicable Debt Financing or (y) any material dispute or disagreement
between or among parties to the applicable Commitment Letter or
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing of which the

 



49  applicable Party become awares; and (iii) if for any reason the applicable
Parties determine in good faith that they will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the applicable Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the applicable Commitment Letter. The
Recipient Parties and the Contributing Parties shall keep each other informed
on a reasonably current basis of the status of their efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing and, in the case of the Recipient Parties, provide copies of
all draft and executed documents related to the Debt Financing to the
Contributing Parties. In the event that the Debt Financing as it relates to
the Recipient Parties will not be funded on the Closing Date, then the
Recipient Parties shall obtain any consents required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement under
the Existing NRGY Credit Agreement prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the NRGY Parties shall be permitted to pay any and all fees
to the lenders and administrative agent in connection with obtaining any such
consent without the prior consent of the Contributing Parties.

effect the current director and officer liability insurance policy or policies
that NRGY GP has as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) upon the
termination or cancellation of any such policy or policies, (A) provide
director and officer liability insurance in substitution for, or in
replacement of, such cancelled or terminated policy or policies or (B)
provide a "tail" or run-off policy, in each case so that any person serving as
a member of the board of directors of NRGY GP as of the date of this
Agreement, any former member of the board of directors and any officer has
coverage thereunder for acts, events, occurrences or omissions occurring or
arising at or prior to the Closing to the same extent (including, without
limitation, policy limits, exclusions and scope) as such person has coverage
for such acts, events, occurrences or omissions under the director and
officer insurance policy maintained by NRGY GP as of the date of this

payments, awards, penalties, interest and expense (including reasonable
expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses in connection with

representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement (each such
misrepresentation or breach or inaccuracy, a " _Warranty Breach_ "), or (ii)
breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by the Contributing
Parties pursuant to this Agreement (other than a covenant or agreement made or
to be performed pursuant to Section 7.09); provided that with respect to
indemnification by the Contributing Parties for Warranty Breaches pursuant to
this Section 10.02(a) (other than Warranty Breaches with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.02 and 3.06 and
other than with respect to fraud), (i) the Contributing Parties shall not be
liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to all such
Warranty Breaches exceeds $4,500,000 and then only to the extent of such
excess; and (ii) the Contributing Parties maximum liability for all such
Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $33,750,000.

(b) Effective after the Closing, subject to terms and conditions of this
Article X, the Recipient Parties, jointly and severally, hereby indemnify the
Contributing Parties, their respective Affiliates and Representatives
(collectively, the " _Contributing_

 



54   _Party Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees to hold each of them harmless
from any and all Damages actually incurred or suffered by any such
Contributing Party Indemnitee arising out of (i) any misrepresentation or
breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of the
Recipient Parties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
in connection with this Agreement (each such misrepresentation or breach of
warranty a " _Recipient Party Warranty Breach_ ") or (ii) breach of covenant
or agreement made or to be performed by the Recipient Parties pursuant to this
Agreement (other than a covenant or agreement made or to be performed
pursuant to Section 7.09); provided that with respect to indemnification by
the Recipient Parties for a Recipient Party Warranty Breaches pursuant to this
Section 10.02(b) (other than Warranty Breaches with respect to
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.02 and other than
with respect to fraud), (i) the Recipient Parties shall not be liable unless

Warranty Breaches exceeds $4,500,000 and then only to the extent of such
excess and (ii) the Recipient Parties maximum liability for all such
Recipient Party Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $33,750,000.

 

(c) For purposes of indemnification pursuant to Section 10.02(a) or Section
10.02(b), any qualification of representations and warranties set forth
herein by reference to materiality or "CMLP Material Adverse Effect" or "NRGY
Material Adverse Effect", as applicable, shall be disregarded in determining
any breach thereof or the amount of Damages arising therefrom

Section 10.03 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) The Person seeking indemnification under Section 10.02 (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom
indemnity is to be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of
any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any Third
Party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under Section 11.02. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations or liability hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall
have actually adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 11.03, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense; provided, that the Indemnified Party
is hereby authorized, prior to the Indemnifying Partys delivery of a written
election to the Indemnified Party of its agreement to defend such Third-Party
Claim, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall reasonably
deem necessary to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim, it shall within 30 days after receipt of the notice
referred to in Section

 



55  10.03(a) notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its intent to do so. The
Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume control of such defense of
the Third-Party Claim only for so long as it conducts such defense with
reasonable diligence. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified
Parties advised of the status of such Third-Party Claim and the defense
thereof on a reasonably current basis and shall consider in good faith
the recommendations made by the Indemnified Parties with respect thereto. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the defense of any Third-Party
Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.03, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim,
if (A) the settlement or compromise does not release the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, (B) the amount of any damages to be paid with respect to
the settlement of such Third Party Claim is in excess of the $45,000,000 cap,
(C) the settlement or compromise imposes injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or (D) the
Indemnifying Party does not agree in writing to pay such amounts payable
pursuant to such settlement or compromise, and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Third-Party Claim
and to employ, at its expense, separate counsel of its choice for
such purpose; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any such Third-Party Claim but fails to diligently prosecute such claim, or if
the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claim, the
Indemnified Party may assume control of such defense and the Indemnifying
Party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of such defense (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses); and provided, further, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
reasonable costs and expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) of the Indemnified Party if (x) the Indemnified Partys
counsel shall have reasonably concluded and advised that there are defenses
available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (y) the Indemnified Partys
counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that there is a conflict of
interest that could make it inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle,
compromise, take any corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed
judgment or consent decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnified Party
to any criminal liability, requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on
the part of the Indemnified Party or imposes any continuing obligation on or
requires any payment from the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified
Partys prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

(d) Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their respective
controlled Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution
of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

 



56 Section 10.04 _Direct Claim Procedures_. If the Indemnified Party has a claim
for indemnity under Section 10.02 against the Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification
(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party).
The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Section 10.05  _Calculation of Damages_.

(a) The amount of any Damages payable under Section 10.02 by the Indemnifying
Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible therefor. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in collecting such amount. The
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged
to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 10.02.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 10.02 for any (x)
punitive, exemplary or special Damages, or any other Damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable or (xi) Damages for lost profits, except with respect
to Damages for lost profits, to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction
determined that lost profits is the appropriate measure of direct damages
with respect to the matters giving rise to the claim for Damages; provided
that nothing herein shall prevent any Indemnified Party from recovering for
all components of awards against them in Third Party Claims for
which recovery is provided under this Article X, including punitive,
exemplary or special Damages and Damages for lost profits.

(c) The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate in accordance with Law any loss for which the Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification under this Agreement. If the Indemnified Party mitigates
losses after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any
indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to
the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the
Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys reasonable
costs of mitigation) promptly after the benefit is received.

 

Section 10.06 _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 10.02 and it is reasonably likely that the Indemnified Party could
have recovered all or a part of such Damages

 



57  from a Third Party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying
claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 10.07 _Exclusivity_. After the Closing and except as otherwise set
forth in Section 7.09 with respect to matters relating to Taxes, Section 10.02
will (in the absence of fraud) provide the exclusive remedy for each of the
parties hereto for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy or breach of any
representation and warranty or any breach of covenant or other agreement or
other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than equitable remedies as they relate to breaches of covenants
or other agreements contained herein to the extent such covenants or
agreements are to be performed after the Closing). For the avoidance
of doubt, no Contributing Party shall be entitled to seek or recover by
contribution or otherwise any amounts from Gas Services GP or any of its
Affiliates on account of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty or breach of covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement
or otherwise.

  ANNEX A

During the Subordination Period (as defined below), the Subordinated Units
shall be entitled to distributions of Available Cash with respect to any
Quarter within the Subordination Period that is deemed to be Operating
Surplus only after each Common Unit has received a Minimum Quarterly
Distribution of $0.13 plus any Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage existing with
respect to such Quarter. The Subordination Period shall begin with the first
full quarterly period following the Closing Date and shall end on the first
business day after (i) the amount of Adjusted Operating Surplus generated
during one consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter period equals or exceeds
the sum of the minimum aggregate distribution of $0.52 paid on all
outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units during such period (based on a
weighted average of such units outstanding during the period), (ii) the
distribution of Available Cash from Operating Surplus on each Common Unit and
Subordinated Unit outstanding during such entire period equaled or exceeded a
minimum aggregate distribution of $0.52 and (iii) there are no Cumulative
Common Unit Arrearages (the " _Subordination Period_ "). When the
Subordination Period ends, all Subordinated Units will convert into Common
Units on a one-for-one basis. Once all Subordinated Units have been converted
into Common Units, the Common Units will no longer be entitled to arrearages.

shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Second Amended and
Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Inergy, L.P. dated as of January
7, 2004.
