to be Operating Surplus only after each Common Unit has received a Minimum Quarterly Distribution of $0.13 plus any Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage existing with respect to such Quarter. The Subordination Period shall begin with the first full
quarterly period following the Closing Date and shall end on the first business day after (i)&nbsp;the amount of Adjusted Operating Surplus generated during one consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter period equals or exceeds the sum of the
minimum aggregate distribution of $0.52 paid on all outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units during such period (based on a weighted average of such units outstanding during the period), (ii)&nbsp;the distribution of Available Cash from
Operating Surplus on each Common Unit and Subordinated Unit outstanding during such entire period equaled or exceeded a minimum aggregate distribution of $0.52 and (iii)&nbsp;there are no Cumulative Common Unit Arrearages (the &#147;<U>Subordination
Period</U>&#148;). When the Subordination Period ends, all Subordinated Units will convert into Common Units on a one-for-one basis. Once all Subordinated Units have been converted into Common Units, the Common Units will no longer be entitled to
arrearages. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement or in this Annex A shall have the meanings ascribed to
