which it acquires (whether through merger, asset sale or otherwise) a majority of the equity interests in a Party or a majority of the assets of a Party (each such acquirer, a &#147;<B><I>Successor</I></B>&#148;), then such Party shall cause the
Successor to, as a condition to the consummation of such transaction(s), expressly assume the obligations of such Party under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; provided, that no such assumption shall relieve such Party of any
obligation hereunder. In addition, for a period of three (3)&nbsp;years from the date hereof, if (i)&nbsp;a Party desires to distribute, or distributes, to its equityholders in one or more transactions the equity interests owned by such Party in an
Affiliate (or the consideration received therefor) and (ii)&nbsp;such equity interests (or the consideration received therefor) constitute more than 50% of the consolidated assets on a fair value basis of such Party, taking into account any prior
distributions of such equity interests (or the consideration received therefor), then such Party may effect such distribution only if such Affiliate expressly assumes the obligations of such Party under this Agreement and the other Transaction
