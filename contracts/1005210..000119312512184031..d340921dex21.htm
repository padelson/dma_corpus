statement of Final Working Capital with reasonable supporting documentation
and showing the calculation thereof. Acquirer shall provide NRGY with copies
of all work papers and other relevant documents, and reasonable access to the
books and records and accounting personnel, used to calculate the Final
Working Capital in order to permit NRGY to verify the accuracy of the Final
Working Capital. Within thirty (30) days following NRGYs receipt of the
statement of Final Working Capital, NRGY shall notify Acquirer if NRGY
disagrees with Acquirers determination of Final Working Capital. If NRGY
does not so notify Acquirer within said thirty (30) day period, NRGY shall be
conclusively deemed to have accepted Acquirers determination of the Final
Working Capital. If NRGY does notify Acquirer that NRGY disagrees with
Acquirers determination of Final Working Capital, then NRGY and Acquirer will

NRGY and Acquirer are unable to agree on the calculation of Final Working
Capital within forty (40) days after NRGYs receipt of the statement of Final
Working Capital, then either Party shall have the right to require the Final
Working Capital to be finally and conclusively determined by an independent

are unable to agree upon an independent accounting firm within ten (10) days
after the end of such forty (40) day period, then NRGY shall select the
independent accounting firm from a list of three independent accounting firms
proposed by Acquirer. The determination of Final Working Capital by such
accounting firm shall be final and binding on, and nonappealable by, Acquirer
and NRGY, and the fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne
equally by NRGY and Acquirer. If the Final Working Capital, as finally and
conclusively determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, is less than
$50,000,000, then, within five (5) days following the final determination
thereof, NRGY shall pay to Acquirer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts designated in writing by Acquirer, the amount
of such difference, and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount
of such difference. If the Final Working Capital, as finally and conclusively
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, is greater than $70,000,000, then,
within five (5) days following the final determination thereof, Acquirer
shall pay to NRGY, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated in writing by NRGY, the amount of such excess,
and the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of such excess.

Section 2.6 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Acquirer and Acquirers transfer
agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment (" _Withholding Taxes_ "). To the extent that
Withholding Taxes are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.7 _Spin-Off._ As promptly as practicable after the Form S-1 is
declared effective by the SEC, NRGY will consummate the Spin-Off as a
registered distribution of the Spin-Off Units on the terms pursuant to the
Form S-1.

 



7 Section 2.8 _Tax Treatment of NRGY Contribution and Inergy Sales
Contribution_. The Parties intend, solely for Tax purposes, that (i) the NRGY
Contribution shall be treated as (A) a contribution by NRGY to Acquirer of a
portion of the Acquired Interests in exchange for the NRGY Equity
Consideration in a transaction consistent with the requirements of Section
721(a) of the Code and (B) the sale by NRGY to Acquirer of a portion of the
Acquired Interests in exchange for the NRGY Cash Consideration (plus assumed
liabilities to the extent properly taken into account under the Code); (ii)
the Acquirer shall be treated as taking the Acquired Interests subject to the
NRGY Notes Indebtedness; (iii) the portion of the NRGY Notes Indebtedness
represented by the 2021 Inergy Notes shall be treated as a qualified
liability within the meaning of Section 1.707-5(a)(6) of the Treasury
Regulations; and (iv) NRGYs share of the Guaranteed Debt under Sections
1.752-2 and 1.707-5(a)(2)(i) of the Treasury Regulations shall be the entire
amount of the Guaranteed Debt. The Parties intend that the Inergy Sales
Contribution shall be treated as (A) a contribution by Inergy Sales to
Acquirer of a portion of the Acquired Assets in exchange for the Inergy Sales
Equity Consideration in a transaction consistent with the requirements of
Section 721(a) of the Code and (B) the sale by Inergy Sales to Acquirer of a
portion of the Acquired Assets in exchange for the Inergy Sales Cash
Consideration. The tax treatment described in this _Section 2.8_ with
respect to the NRGY Contribution and the Inergy Sales Contribution is referred
to as the " _Intended Tax Treatment_." Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, the Parties agree to file all Tax Returns and otherwise act at all times
in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment, provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent any Party from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority with respect to the
Intended Tax Treatment, and neither Party shall be required to litigate before
any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority
challenging the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

Section 2.9 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

(a) The Cash Consideration, the Equity Consideration and assumed liabilities,
to the extent properly taken into account under the Code, shall be allocated
among the Acquired Interests and the Acquired Assets consistent with the
principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law, as appropriate) (the " _Allocation_ "). Within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the date the Final Working Capital is finally and conclusively
determined pursuant to _Section 2.5_, Acquirer shall deliver the Allocation
to NRGY for NRGYs approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. NRGY and Acquirer shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes
relating to the Allocation. If NRGY and Acquirer are unable to resolve any
such dispute within fifteen (15) days of Acquirers delivery of
the Allocation to NRGY, such dispute shall be resolved promptly and finally
by an independent accounting firm that is mutually selected by Acquirer and
NRGY. If the Parties are unable to agree upon an independent accounting firm
within ten (10) days after the end of such fifteen (15) day period, then NRGY
shall select the independent accounting firm from a list of three independent
accounting firms proposed by Acquirer. The costs of the independent account
firm shall be borne equally by NRGY and Acquirer.

(b) If the Cash Consideration is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the
Allocation shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with the Allocation
prepared pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ above.

 



8 (c) Acquirer and NRGY shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the
Allocation. Neither Acquirer nor NRGY shall take any Tax position
inconsistent with such Allocation, and neither Acquirer nor NRGY shall agree
to any proposed adjustment to the Allocation by any Tax Authority without
first giving the other party prior written notice;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent Acquirer or NRGY from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority based upon or arising
out of the Allocation, and neither Acquirer nor NRGY shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax
Authority challenging such Allocation.

The foregoing investigation and inquiry by NRGY and Inergy Sales, however,

representations and warranties of Acquirer to the Contributor Parties in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

force and effect, all premiums due thereon have been paid by the applicable
Contributor Party or such Affiliate, and the applicable Contributor Party or

policy and has not received written notice from any of its insurance brokers
or carriers that such broker or carrier will not be willing or able to renew

in the Exchange Offer Documents or in the Form S-1 will, at the time the
Exchange Offer is commenced or the Form S-1 becomes effective under the

or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

supplied by Acquirer for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the

notice shall identify the applicable representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement and disclosure schedule, if any, for which such breach or inaccuracy

cure any such breach of or inaccuracy in such notifying Partys
representations and warranties or covenants and agreements or in the
Contributor Disclosure Schedule or the Acquirer Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be, for any purpose under this Agreement and no such notification
shall limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to the other Parties;

Section 5.3 _Access to Information_. From the Execution Date until the
Contribution Closing Date, upon reasonable notice, NRGY will, subject to
compliance with Law governing the access to or use of such information, (a)
give Acquirer and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors,
financing sources and other authorized representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and
records of Inergy Sales or the Propane Group Entities relating to the Propane
Business, and permit such Persons to make copies thereof, in each case during
normal business hours and (b) furnish such financial and operating data and
other information relating to the Propane Business, as such Persons may
reasonably request. In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made
against or incurred by Acquirer, the Acquired Assets or the Propane Group
Entities after the Contribution Closing or for any other reasonable purpose,
for a period of seven (7) years (or such shorter period as provided in the
document retention policy of NRGY as of the date of this Agreement) after the
Contribution Closing Date, the Contributor Parties shall (i) retain the books
and records of the Contributor Parties which relate to the Propane Business,
the Acquired Assets and the Propane Group Entities and their operations for
periods prior to the Contribution Closing and which shall not otherwise have
been delivered to Acquirer or the Propane Group Entities in a
manner reasonably consistent with the prior practice of Inergy Sales or the
Propane Group Entities and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford Acquirer and
its Affiliates and Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to the offices, properties, books and records of the Contributor
Parties. In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or

in the document retention policy of Acquirer as of the date of this Agreement)
after the Contribution Closing Date, Acquirer shall, and shall cause the
Propane Group Entities to, (i) retain the books and records relating to the
Propane Business, the Acquired Assets and the Propane Group Entities in their
possession as of the Contribution Closing Date relating to periods prior to

the Contributor Parties and their respective Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to such books and records. Any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall be conducted upon
reasonable prior notice to, and in such manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of, the Party providing such
access. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be entitled to perform
any intrusive or subsurface investigation or other sampling of, on or under
any of the properties of another Party without the prior written consent of
such other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
5.3_, no Party shall be required to grant access or furnish information
to the extent that such information is subject to an attorney-client or
attorney work-product privilege or protection or that such access or the
furnishing of such information is prohibited by Law or an existing Contract.
To the extent practicable, such Party not granting access or furnishing
information in the preceding sentence shall make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply, including the execution of a
joint defense agreement to allow the parties to exchange information protected
by the attorney-client privilege or work-product doctrine. To the fullest
extent permitted by Law, no Party nor any of its Representatives or
Affiliates shall be responsible or liable to another Party for personal
injuries sustained in connection with the access provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.3_ and such Party providing access shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the visiting Party for any losses suffered by any such Persons in
connection with any such personal injuries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
personal injuries are not caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the hosting Party. The Parties agree that they will not, and will cause
their Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 5.3_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or the resolution of
the aforesaid claims. Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed in any
way to limit or modify the rights and obligations of the Parties under
_Article VIII_.

 



44 Section 5.4 _Governmental Approvals_.

 

(a) The Parties will cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from any Governmental Authorities any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained
and to make or cause to be made any filings with or notifications or
submissions to any Governmental Authority that are necessary in order
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and
shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with
each other in the prosecution of, such matters. Each of the Parties agrees to
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections,
if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or other Person, to
contest and resist, any Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) of any Governmental Authority that is in
effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Parties agree
to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to
submit any required filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the
HSR Act within a reasonable period of time but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Execution Date, and to respond to any requests for
additional information made by any Governmental Authority, to cause the
waiting period under the HSR Act to expire or terminate. Acquirer shall pay
the statutory filing fee associated with filings under the HSR Act, and NRGY
shall reimburse Acquirer for one-half of the paid statutory filing fee.

(c) Each Party will furnish to the other Parties all information reasonably
required for any filing to be made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including Notification and Report
Forms pursuant to the HSR Act and filings with any other
Governmental Authority. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, each Party
shall promptly inform the other Parties of any material communication with, or
any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority regarding any such filing. If a Party intends to independently
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then such Party shall give the
other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting and invite
representatives of the other Parties to participate in the meeting with the
Governmental Authority unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority.

 



45 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
_Sections 5.4(e)_ and _5.4(f)_ hereof, Acquirer commits to take the following
steps: proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of assets or otherwise taking or committing to take actions that
limit Acquirers freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
assets as may be required in order to obtain all consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required under any applicable
antitrust Law or to avoid the commencement of any action to prohibit the
transactions as contemplated by the Transaction Agreements under any
applicable antitrust Law; _provided_ , however, that Acquirer shall not be
required to take any of the steps described in this _Section 5.4(d)_ if the
aggregate gross sales revenue, calculated in accordance with GAAP, generated
by the assets that must be sold, divested, licensed, otherwise disposed of,
or impacted was greater than $250,000,000 for the 2011 fiscal year.

(e) If, in order to comply with Acquirers obligations under _Section
5.4(d)_, (i) Acquirer sells, divests or otherwise disposes of any assets, (ii)
the disposed assets in the aggregate generated gross sales revenue, calculated
in accordance with GAAP, of more than $50,000,000 for the 2011 fiscal year
and (iii) the aggregate consideration, if any, that Acquirer receives for the
disposed assets (the " _Divestiture Proceeds_ ") is less than the aggregate
value of the disposed assets (the " _Divested Assets Value_ ") based on a
multiple of the estimated sustainable cash flow of the disposed assets, NRGY
shall pay to Acquirer, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of written
notice from Acquirer of the closing of any such divestiture (the "
_Divestiture Notice_ "), an amount equal to the Divested Assets Value minus
the Divestiture Proceeds. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the Divested
Assets Value within fifteen (15) days of Acquirers delivery to NRGY of the
Divestiture Notice, then such dispute shall be resolved promptly by an Expert
chosen by NRGY from a list of three (3) Experts proposed by Acquirer, with
costs of such Expert borne equally by NRGY and Acquirer.

(f) In connection with any divestiture required by _Section 5.4(d)_, Acquirer
agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to consult with NRGY
regarding the nature of any process undertaken by Acquirer for such
divestiture.

Section 5.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
costs and expenses incurred by the Contributor Parties or the Propane Group
Entities in connection with the Transaction Agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby, shall be paid by the Contributor Parties, and all costs
and expenses incurred by Acquirer in connection with the Transaction
Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be paid
by Acquirer.

 



46 Section 5.6 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including and subject to the limitations contained in
_Section 5.4_, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Party will use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain timely all authorizations, consents and approvals of all third
parties (a) necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or (b) as are required to comply
with the terms and conditions of the Contracts set forth on _Schedule
2.4(a)(vi)_ of the Contributor Disclosure Schedule, in each case prior to the
Contribution Closing. The Parties will coordinate and cooperate with each
other in exchanging such information and assistance as any of the Parties may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

Section 5.7 _Public Statements_. Neither NRGY or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, nor Acquirer or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall issue any
public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without having first
obtained the consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
any of NRGY and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of Acquirer and
its Affiliates, on the other hand, may make any public disclosure after
giving the other Party as much advance notice as is practical under the
circumstances, if such disclosing Party believes, after consultation with
legal counsel, that it is required to do so by Law or by any stock exchange
listing requirement or trading agreement concerning the publicly traded
securities of NRGY or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Acquirer or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand.

 

Section 5.8 _Equity Consideration; Legends_. Each of NRGY and Inergy Sales
agrees to the recording, so long as the restrictions described in the legend
are applicable, of the following legend on any book entry notation or
certificate evidencing all or any portion of any Suburban Common Units
constituting the Equity Consideration:

 

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
" _SECURITIES ACT_ "), AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
AGREEMENT OF SUBURBAN PROPANE PARTNERS, L.P., AS IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME.
THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF SUBURBAN PROPANE
PARTNERS, L.P. THAT THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE
FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE
THE EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF SUBURBAN PROPANE PARTNERS, L.P. UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE SUBURBAN PROPANE PARTNERS, L.P. TO
BE TREATED AS AN ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE TO BE TAXED
AS AN ENTITY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT ALREADY
SO TREATED OR TAXED). SUBURBAN PROPANE PARTNERS, L.P. MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL
RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT RECEIVES AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF
SUBURBAN PROPANE PARTNERS, L.P. BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE
BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

 



47 Section 5.9 _Confidential Information_.

 

(a) Effective upon, and only upon, the Contribution Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to the Information.
Acquirer acknowledges that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
the Confidentiality Agreement, any and all other information provided or made
available to it by the Contributor Parties (or their Representatives)
concerning the Contributor Parties or their Affiliates (other than the
Propane Group Entities, including the Propane Business and the Acquired
Assets) will remain subject to the terms and conditions of such
Confidentiality Agreement for a period of one year after the Contribution
Closing. The Contributor Parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, any and all
information provided or made available to them by Acquirer (or its
Representatives) concerning Acquirer or its Affiliates will remain subject to
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement for a period of one
year after the Contribution Closing. The Clean Team Agreement shall remain
effective during the period between the Execution Date and the Contribution
Closing.

(b) For a period of five (5) years after the Contribution Closing,
the Contributor Parties and their respective Affiliates shall not, directly
or indirectly, disclose to any Person any trade secret, confidential or
proprietary business information, data or material developed by, or on behalf
of, Inergy Sales or any Propane Group Entity relating to the Acquired Assets
and the business and operations of the Propane Group Entities, including the
Propane Business (collectively, the " _Information_ "), whether acquired prior
to or after the Contribution Closing Date, which has not become generally
available to the public (other than as a result of a breach of this _Section
5.9_).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Contributor Parties
or any of their respective Affiliates are required by Law or applicable stock
exchange rules to disclose any Information, such Party shall (i) notify
Acquirer as promptly as practicable of the existence, terms and circumstances
surrounding such a request, so that Acquirer may either waive such Partys
compliance with the terms of this _Section 5.9_ or seek an appropriate
protective order or other remedy and (ii) if Acquirer seeks such a protective
order, to provide such cooperation as Acquirer may reasonably request (at
Acquirers sole expense). In the event that Acquirer waives compliance (in
whole or in part) with the terms of this _Section 5.9_, or such protective
order or other remedy is denied, as a result of which such Contributor Party
or its Affiliate is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose
such Information, the Contributor Party or its Affiliate, as the case may be,
shall furnish only that portion of the Information that its legal counsel
advises is legally required, and the Contributor Party or its Affiliate shall
exercise its reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
remainder of the Information. In no event shall a Contributor Party or its
Affiliates oppose action by Acquirer to obtain a protective order or other
relief to prevent the disclosure of Information or to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Information.

 



48 Section 5.10 _No Solicitation_. From the Execution Date until the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Contribution Closing Date, the Contributor
Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (other than the
Propane Group Entities) to not, solicit for employment any division
presidents, field management level employees or district management level
employees (or their counterparts) of the Propane Group Entities, Acquirer or
Suburban GP or any of their respective Affiliates, while the same are still
employed by that Person and for a period of six (6) months following the
termination of such employment. From the Contribution Closing Date until the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Contribution Closing Date, Acquirer shall not,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates to not, solicit for employment any
division presidents, field management level employees or district management
level employees of the Contributor Parties or any of their Affiliates (other
than the Propane Group Entities), with whom Acquirer first came into
initial contact as a result of the negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements,
while the same are still employed by that Person and for a period of six (6)
months following the termination of such employment. The restrictions in this
_Section 5.10_ regarding the prohibition on solicitations shall not apply to
any solicitation by way of general advertising, including general
solicitations in any local, regional or national newspapers or other
publications or circulars or on internet sites or any search firm engagement
which is not directed or focused on employees of the Contributor Parties,
Acquirer or their respective Affiliates, as applicable. The Parties each
agree that the other Party may seek to enforce the provisions of this _Section
5.10_ by seeking to obtain injunctions, restraining orders and other equitable
actions pursuant to _Section 9.4_.

 

Section 5.11 _Non-Competition_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, for a period of five (5)
years after the Contribution Closing Date, the Contributor Parties shall not,
and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to not, directly or
indirectly, (x) engage in, or acquire an equity interest in, or provide debt
financing to any Person who is engaged in, the Restricted Business in the
United States (the " _Restricted Territory_ "), (y) request any past, present
or future customers of the Propane Group Entities within the Restricted
Territory to curtail or cancel their business with Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Propane Group Entities), or (z) except as required
by Law, disclose to any Person the names of past or existing customers of the
Propane Group Entities. Nothing in this Agreement or in the definition of
Restricted Business shall prohibit or in any way restrict any NRGY Entity
from:

(i) acquiring or owning the Retained Units, the Retained Assets or
otherwise entering into or exercising any rights of such NRGY Entity pursuant
to the NRGY Support Agreement or acquiring or owning less than 5% of the
outstanding voting power of any other publicly traded Person, including if
such Person is engaged in a Restricted Business;

(ii) performing its obligations under the Transaction Agreements; or

 



49 (iii) acquiring the assets or capital stock or other equity interests of
any Person which is engaged in a Restricted Business (" _Acquired Company_ ")
if, in its last full fiscal year prior to such acquisition, the consolidated
revenues of such Acquired Company from the Restricted Business in
the Restricted Territory was less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
aggregate consolidated revenues of such Acquired Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if an NRGY Entity acquires an Acquired Company with
consolidated revenues from a Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory
greater than ten percent (10%) of the aggregate consolidated revenues of such
Acquired Company, such NRGY Entity shall (A) provide Acquirer the exclusive
opportunity, for a period of forty five (45) days following the closing of
such acquisition, to negotiate the purchase of such portion of such business
that is engaged in the Restricted Business and (B) if such NRGY Entity and
Acquirer do not enter into an agreement with respect to Acquirers purchase
of such portion of such business within such forty five (45)-day period,
divest such portion of such entire business within nine (9) months of the
acquisition.

 

(b) The Contributor Parties agree that the duration and geographic scope of
the non-competition provision set forth in this  _Section 5.11_ are
reasonable. In the event that any court determines that the duration or
geographic scope of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.11_, or
both, is unreasonable and that such provision is to that
extent unenforceable, the Parties agree that the provision shall remain in
full force and effect for the greatest time period and in the greatest area
that would not render it unenforceable. The Parties intend that this non-
competition provision shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants,
one for each and every county of each and every state of the United States of
America. Additionally, because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses
to Acquirer as a result of a breach of this  _Section 5.11_, and because of
the immediate and irreparable damage that could be caused to Acquirer for
which it may not have any other adequate remedy, the Contributor Parties agree
that Acquirer may seek to enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ by
seeking to obtain injunctions, restraining orders and other equitable actions
pursuant to _Section 9.4_.

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Post-Contribution Closing Tax Returns_. Acquirer shall cause the Propane
Group Entities to prepare all Tax Returns relating to the Propane Group
Entities and the Acquired Assets for all taxable periods beginning on or
before the Contribution Closing Date that are due after the Contribution
Closing Date. With respect to any such Tax Returns, the portion of any Tax
payable with respect to a taxable period beginning on or prior to the
Contribution Closing Date and ending after the Contribution Closing Date shall
be allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on the Contribution
Closing Date in a manner consistent with the definition of Excluded Taxes (the
" _Pre-Contribution Closing Tax_ "), other than Withholding Taxes, for
which the Contributor Parties shall be solely liable in a manner consistent
with _Section 2.6_ and _Section 5.12(a)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
NRGY will be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns for
Inergy Sales, whether before or after the Contribution Closing.

(i) In the case of any income Tax:

 

(A) Not later than ten (10) days prior to the due date of any estimated income
Tax payment relating to any Pre-Contribution Closing Tax, Acquirer shall
deliver to NRGY for its review a statement calculating the excess, if any, of
(x) the Pre-Contribution Closing Tax currently payable over (y) the amount
shown as a liability for such Tax and treated as an Assumed Liability on
_Schedule 2.4(a)(xvi)_ (such amount, the " _Reserved Taxes_ "). Acquirer shall
make or cause to be made such changes in such statement as NRGY may reasonably
request, which changes shall be subject to Acquirers approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Thereafter, and not later than five (5) days
prior to the due date of such estimated income Tax payment, NRGY shall pay to
Acquirer the amount of any such excess. 

 



50 (B) Not later than twenty (20) days prior to the due date of any income Tax
Return covering a Pre-Contribution Closing Tax, Acquirer shall deliver to NRGY
for its review a copy of such income Tax Return and a statement calculating
the amount by which the Pre-Contribution Closing Tax reflected on such income
Tax Return is greater than or less than the Reserved Taxes and the amount of
any payments paid by NRGY to Acquirer with respect to estimated income Tax
payments of such Pre-Contribution Closing Tax pursuant to _Section
5.12(a)(i)(A)_, which amount of estimated income Tax payments shall be
treated as a credit against Pre-Contribution Closing Tax owed to Acquirer by
the Contributor Parties. Acquirer shall make or cause to be made such changes
in such income Tax Returns or such statement as NRGY may reasonably request,
which changes shall be subject to Acquirers approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date of
such income Tax Return, NRGY shall pay to Acquirer (or Acquirer shall pay to
NRGY, if appropriate) the amount of such difference. Upon receipt thereof,
Acquirer shall file or cause to be filed such income Tax Return and shall pay
all income Taxes shown to be due thereon.

 

(ii) In the case of any Tax Return or Tax payment relating to any Pre-
Contribution Closing Tax not addressed by  _Section 5.12(a)(i)_ (including
any Withholding Taxes required to be paid after the Contribution Closing
Date), Acquirer shall prepare and file such Tax Returns and pay such Taxes in
a manner consistent with past practice (except as otherwise required by Law).
As soon as practicable following the filing of such Tax Return and/or payment
of such Tax, Acquirer shall deliver to NRGY a copy of such Tax Return or
evidence of such payment and a statement calculating the amount by which the
Pre-Contribution Closing Tax with respect to such Tax Return or such payment
is greater than or less than the amount shown as a liability for such Tax and
treated as an Assumed Liability on _Schedule 2.4(a)(xvi)_. Not later than
five (5) days following the receipt of such information, NRGY shall pay to
Acquirer (or Acquirer shall pay to NRGY, if appropriate) the amount of such
difference.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. All excise, sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing,
recordation and other similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or
penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions
or penalties, resulting directly from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be borne 50% by Acquirer and 50%
by NRGY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.12_,
any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed as soon as practical in connection with the Contribution
Closing by the Party primarily or customarily responsible under the
applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such Party will provide
such Tax Returns to the other Party for review prior to filing such Tax
Returns. Upon the filing of Tax Returns in connection with Transfer
Taxes, the filing Party shall provide the other Party with evidence
satisfactory to the other Party that such Transfer Taxes have been filed and
paid. Any amounts owed by a Party pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)_ shall be
paid within five (5) days of receipt of such evidence that such Transfer
Taxes have been filed and paid.

 



51 (c) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

 

(i) Acquirer and the Contributor Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes related to the transactions pursuant to this Agreement, the Acquired
Assets or the Propane Group Entities. Such cooperation shall include the
retention until the later of (A) seven (7) years from the Contribution Closing
Date or (B) the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and (upon
the other Partys request) the provision of records and information in such
Partys possession that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation
or other proceeding and making employees available on the basis of reasonable
best efforts to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Prior to the destruction or discarding of any
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Assets
or the Propane Group Entities relating to any taxable period beginning on or
before the Contribution Closing Date, each Party shall give the other Party
reasonable written notice and, if the other Party so requests, shall itself
allow, or cause the Propane Group Entities to allow the other Party to take,
possession of such books and records. In connection with any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes related to the Acquired
Assets or the Propane Group Entities for taxable periods beginning on or
before the Contribution Closing Date, Acquirer and NRGY shall promptly notify
each other upon receipt by such Party of written notice of any inquiries,
claims, assessments, audits, or similar events. Except as provided below,
Acquirer shall have sole control of the conduct of all such audit,
litigation or other proceedings with respect to Taxes related to the Acquired
Assets or the Propane Group Entities for periods beginning on or before the
Contribution Closing Date, including any settlement or compromise thereof;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , Acquirer shall keep the Contributor Parties
reasonably informed of the progress of any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and shall not affect any such settlement or compromise with respect
to which any Contributor Party is liable pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_
without obtaining such Contributor Partys prior written consent thereto,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect
to any such audit, litigation or other proceedings with respect to Taxes for
which the Contributor Parties may be required to indemnify Acquirer pursuant
to _Section 8.1(c)_, the Contributor Parties shall be entitled, at the
expense of the Contributor Parties, to attend and participate in all
conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to such Tax claim and may
control and assume the defense of such Tax claim in accordance with and
subject to the conditions set forth in _Section 8.4(c)_; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Contributor Parties shall not affect any settlement or
compromise of such Tax claim regarding the Acquired Assets or the Propane
Group Entities without Acquirers prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



52 (ii) Acquirer and Contributor Parties further agree, upon request, to
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby or for any taxable period beginning on or
before the Contribution Closing Date.

(d) _Tax Statements and Information_.

(i) On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of March of each year that NRGY (or
one of its Affiliates) is a partner in Acquirer, Acquirer shall cause NRGY
(or its Affiliates and designees) to be furnished with all information
reasonably necessary or appropriate to file such Persons respective tax
reports, including its Schedules K-1, apportionment schedules and a schedule
of Acquirers book-tax differences for the immediately preceding tax year.

(ii) From time to time, for any taxable period that NRGY (or one of its
Affiliates) is a partner in Acquirer, Acquirer shall furnish NRGY at NRGYs
expense with financial or tax information regarding Acquirer that is
reasonably requested by NRGY (or its Affiliates and designees), including, (A)
book and tax basis information for Acquirers assets sufficient to allow NRGY
to satisfy its own obligations and make its own computations, allocations and
adjustments under Sections 704(b), 704(c) and 754 of the Code, (B) reports of
Acquirers gross income broken down by activity, and (C) reasonable access to
service providers (including Acquirers accountants) of Acquirer.

(iii) By the earlier of (A) November 15, 2012 or (B) forty (40)
days following the determination of the Allocation pursuant to _Section
2.9_, NRGY shall deliver to Acquirer a schedule of the tax basis of and amount
of gain or loss realized (computed in a manner consistent with the Allocation)
with respect to each of the assets contributed by NRGY and Inergy Sales to
Acquirer at the Contribution Closing for Acquirers review and comment. NRGY
and Acquirer shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to such
schedule as promptly as practicable.

Section 5.13 _Books and Records; Financial Statements; Litigation_.

 

(a) The Contributor Parties hereby consent to the inclusion or incorporation
by reference of the Propane Group Audited Financial Statements in any
registration statement, offering memorandum, report or other filing of
Acquirer or any of its Affiliates as to which Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates reasonably determines that such financial statements are required
to be included or incorporated by reference to satisfy any rule or regulation
of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act. The Contributor Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its independent accountants to consent to the inclusion or
incorporation by reference of its audit opinion with respect to any of the
financial statements of the Propane Group Entities in any such registration
statement, report or other filing of Acquirer or its Affiliates, and the
Contributor Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
representation letters, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to its
independent accountants, to be executed and delivered to its
independent accountants in connection with obtaining any such consent from
its independent accountants.

 



53 (b) The Contributor Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Acquirer in connection with the preparation by Acquirer of any
pro forma financial statements of Acquirer or any of its Affiliates that are
derived in part from the financial statements of the Propane Group Entities
that Acquirer or its Affiliates reasonably determines are required to be
included or incorporated by reference in any registration statement, report or
other filing of Acquirer or its Affiliates to satisfy any rule or regulation
of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act.

(c) The Contributor Parties shall provide access to their respective books
and records as may be reasonably necessary for Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates, or any of their respective advisors or Representatives, to conduct
customary due diligence with respect to the financial statements of the
Contributor Parties in connection with any offering of securities by Acquirer
or any of its Affiliates or to enable an accounting firm to prepare and
deliver a customary comfort letter with respect to financial information
relating to the Contributor Parties. 

(d) In connection with any offering, registration statement, offering
memorandum, report or other filing by Acquirer or any of its Affiliates other
than the Form S-1, the Offer to Exchange or arising out of the Registration
Rights Agreement, Acquirer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to promptly
upon request by the Contributor Parties, reimburse the Contributor Parties
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (with no mark-up)
incurred by the Contributor Parties in connection with the cooperation
provided for in _Sections 5.13(a)-(c)_ (such reimbursement to be made
promptly and in any event within seven (7) Business Days of delivery of
reasonably acceptable documentation evidencing such expenses).

 

(e) In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any third-party Proceeding (other than any Proceedings in
which Acquirer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Contributor
Parties or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties) in
connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Contribution Closing Date
involving the Propane Business, each of the other Parties will and, as
applicable, will cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with it and its counsel in
the contest or defense, make available their personnel, and provide such
testimony and access to their books and records as shall be reasonably
requested and necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the
sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.13(e)_ shall limit in any
respect any rights a Party may have with respect to discovery or the
production of documents or other information in connection with any such
Proceeding, and provided further that nothing in this _Section 5.13(e)_ shall
in any way limit or modify the obligations and rights of the Parties under
_Article VIII_. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentences,
Acquirer agrees to cooperate with and provide NRGY and its Affiliates, without
charge for doing so, reasonable access to and the right to make copies of the
books and records of the Propane Group Entities and those relating to the
Propane Business for the purposes of assisting NRGY and its Affiliates (a) in

(including to comply with any indemnity obligations), (b) in preparing and

54 Section 5.14 _Exchange Offer_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the later of the Execution
Date and the filing of NRGYs Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012,
Acquirer shall prepare an offer to exchange relating to the issuance of the
Exchange Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer (including any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Offer to Exchange_ ") and as promptly as
reasonably practicable thereafter commence the Exchange Offer. Acquirer shall
also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the Exchange Offer, and NRGY shall furnish
all information concerning NRGY and the holders of NRGY Notes as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Acquirer shall not be required to qualify or register as
a foreign entity or to take any action that would subject it to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not presently
qualified or registered or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign
entity. No amendment or supplement to the Offer to Exchange will be made by
Acquirer without NRGYs prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without providing NRGY a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Exchange Offer will comply in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the federal
securities laws, and the Offer to Exchange will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
If at any time prior to the completion of the Exchange Offer any information
relating to Acquirer or NRGY, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors, is discovered by Acquirer or NRGY which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Offer to Exchange, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly circulated to the holders of NRGY Notes.

(b) Acquirer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete the
Exchange Offer. Acquirer may not amend, supplement, modify or waive any terms
and conditions of the Exchange Offer, or extend, terminate or withdraw the
Exchange Offer, without NRGYs prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



55 (c) Acquirer shall keep NRGY informed with respect to all material activity
concerning the status of the Exchange Offer and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, will promptly provide to NRGY all reports issued
by the exchange agent for the Exchange Offer as to the principal amounts of
NRGY Notes tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer.

(d) NRGY shall cause the appropriate Representatives of the applicable members
of the Propane Group Entities to execute and deliver any definitive documents
or other certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Acquirer
for delivery at the consummation of the Exchange Offer.

 

(e) Acquirer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) promptly upon
request by the Contributor Parties, reimburse the Contributor Parties for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (with no mark-up) incurred by
the Contributor Parties in connection with the cooperation provided for in
_Section 5.14(d)_ (such reimbursement to be made promptly and in any event
within seven (7) Business Days of delivery of reasonably acceptable
documentation evidencing such expenses) and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless
the Contributor Parties and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Exchange Offer arising out of
any information utilized in connection therewith provided by Acquirer. All
non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Propane
Business obtained by Acquirer, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with _Section 5.9_, except that Acquirer shall be permitted to
disclose such information to rating agencies to the extent necessary in
connection with the Exchange Offer.

(f) Acquirer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered by the exchange agent for
the Exchange Offer, to NRGY on or prior to the Settlement Date, the letters of
transmittal and consent submitted by holders of the NRGY Notes pursuant to
the Exchange Offer.

Contributor Parties will cause the representatives, officers and directors
(and equivalents) of the Propane Group Entities to resign or be removed from
all representative, officer and director positions (and equivalents) as of
the Contribution Closing Date.

Section 5.16 _Names and Marks_.

 

(a) Acquirer hereby acknowledges that all right, title and interest in and to
the "INERGY" and "INERGY PROPANE" names, together with all variations and

trade names, trade dress, logos, slogans, company names and registrations and
applications for registrations thereof, and other identifiers of source or
goodwill, containing or incorporating any of the foregoing (collectively, the
" _Retained Names and Marks_ ") are owned by the Contributor Parties or their
respective Affiliates, and that, except as expressly provided below, any and
all rights of Acquirer, the Propane Group Entities or their respective
Affiliates to use the Retained Names and Marks shall terminate as of the
Contribution Closing, and shall immediately revert to the
Contributor Parties, along with any and all goodwill associated therewith.
Acquirer further acknowledges that neither Acquirer, its Affiliates, nor the

used by the Acquired Assets or the Propane Business prior to such date
(including in the names of the Propane Group Entities), after which period
Acquirer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Propane Group
Entities) to, cease using the Retained Names and Marks. During such three (3)

any successor thereto), and (ii) a link to __www.inergylp.com__ (or any
successor thereto of which Acquirer is notified by NRGY). Acquirer shall, as
soon as reasonably practical following the date hereof, propose the layout and
wording of such page to NRGY, for NRGYs prior consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and NGRY shall thereafter promptly
cause such page to be posted on such domain. For an additional two (2) year
period following the three (3) year period described herein, NRGY shall cause
the Internet domain __www.inergypropane.com__ to consist of a single web page,

previously conducted under the Retained Names and Marks but is no longer
affiliated with the Contributor Parties, to be added to the
__www.inergypropanenypadiv.com__ homepage. Acquirer shall, as soon as
reasonably practical following the date hereof, propose the layout and wording

(5) years following the Contribution Closing Date.

 



57 (e) In no event shall Acquirer, the Propane Group Entities or their respective
Affiliates, register or attempt to register the Retained Names and Marks or
any confusingly similar trade names, trademarks or service marks, or cause the
Retained Names and Marks or any confusingly similar trade names, trademarks or
service marks to be registered in any country, state or other jurisdiction.
Acquirer, its Affiliates and the Propane Group Entities agree not to attack or
contest or assist others in attacking or contesting the Retained Names and
Marks or the Contributor Parties rights in the Retained Names and Marks.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Acquirer hereby
acknowledges that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this
_Section 5.16_, the Contributor Parties, in addition to any other remedies
available, shall be entitled to seek a preliminary injunction, temporary
restraining order or other equivalent relief restraining Acquirer, the Propane
Group Entities or any of their respective Affiliates from any such breach or
threatened breach.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Acquirer shall
have the right to: (i) keep records and other historical or archived
documents containing or referencing the Retained Names and Marks and (ii)
refer to the historical fact that the Acquired Assets and the Propane Business
were previously conducted under the Retained Names and Marks; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any such reference, Acquirer shall make
explicit that the Acquired Assets, the Propane Group Entities and the Propane
Business are no longer affiliated with the Contributor Parties.

Section 5.17 _Updates_. The Contributor Parties, on the one hand, and
Acquirer, on the other hand, may, prior to the Contribution Closing Date,
deliver to the other Parties modifications, changes or updates to (a) the
Contributor Disclosure Schedule or the Acquirer Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, in order to disclose or take into account facts, matters or
circumstances which arise or occur between the Execution Date and the
Contribution Closing Date and which, if existing or occurring as of the
Execution Date, would have been required to be set forth or described in
such Disclosure Schedule and (b) _Schedule 3.15(a)_ of the Contributor
Disclosure Schedule to include contracts entered into prior to the Execution
Date but not included in the original of such schedule (all of the foregoing,
the " _Post-Signing Information_ "). Such Post-Signing Information provided
to Acquirer in accordance with this _Section 5.17_ (a) shall not be deemed to
modify any representation, warranty or covenant made in this Agreement for
purposes of _Section 6.2_, _Section 6.3_ or _Article VIII_ , (b) shall not
be deemed to cure any breach of representation, warranty or covenant made in
this Agreement and (c) shall not reduce any indemnification obligations
arising under _Article VIII_. The Contributor Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Acquirer, by the earlier of the Contribution
Closing Date or sixty (60) days after the Execution Date, a list of all
propane tanks or cylinders with a capacity of 100 pounds or greater that are
(1) owned by any Propane Group Entity, (2) leased to a customer of the Propane
Business and (3) located on such customers premises. 

 



58 Section 5.18 _Insurance_. From and after the Contribution Closing Date,
the Acquired Assets and the Propane Group Entities shall cease to be insured
by the insurance policies of NRGY or its Affiliates or by any of NRGYs self-
insured programs, except with respect to the Other Retained Liabilities and
the Retained Propane Business Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, NRGY
shall retain all rights to control its insurance policies and programs,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or
otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and
programs in connection with the Other Retained Liabilities and the Retained
Propane Business Liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ , that NRGY shall not (a)
amend, terminate or eliminate any of its insurance policies or programs with
respect to which any claim has been made, but not settled, with respect to the
Acquired Assets or any Propane Group Entity on or prior to the Contribution
Closing Date or (b) amend, terminate or eliminate any occurrence-based
insurance policies, but will retain such policies for a period equal to the
applicable statute of limitations. The Contributor Parties shall provide, at
the sole cost and expense of Acquirer, such assistance as Acquirer
may reasonably request between the Execution Date and the Contribution
Closing to assist Acquirer and the Propane Group Entities in obtaining
insurance policies and programs with respect to the Acquired Assets and the
Propane Business at the Contribution Closing. Prior to the Contribution
Closing, NRGY shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, notify its insurance
carriers of any claims or potential claims that, to the Knowledge of the
Contributor Parties, (A) Inergy Sales has with respect to the Acquired Assets
arising on or prior to the Contribution Closing Date or (B) the Propane Group
Entities have with respect to incidents occurring on or prior to the
Contribution Closing Date.

 

Section 5.19 _Release from Credit Support Instruments_. At or prior to the
Contribution Closing, Acquirer shall use reasonable best efforts to, and
shall cause its Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to, secure the
unconditional release, as of the Contribution Closing Date, of any NRGY Entity
from the credit support instruments set forth in _Schedule 5.19_ of
the Contributor Disclosure Schedule (the " _Credit Support Instruments_ "),
including effecting such release by providing guarantees or other credit
support, and Acquirer shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause
its Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to, be substituted in all
respects for each NRGY Entity that is party to the Credit Support Instrument,
so that the Suburban Entities shall be solely responsible for the obligations
of such Credit Support Instrument, only with respect to the Acquired Assets
and the Propane Business, from and after the Contribution Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall reasonable best efforts
require Acquirer or its Affiliates to agree (a) to make any payment to obtain
such release (other than ordinary processing or administrative fees), (b) to
change the terms of any Contract to which such credit support applies in any
manner that is adverse to Acquirer or any of its Affiliates or (c) to any
restriction in the operations of their respective businesses. All costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the release or substitution of the Credit
Support Instruments shall be borne by Acquirer. To the extent Acquirer is
unable to obtain release for any Credit Support Instrument prior to the
Contribution Closing, Acquirer shall indemnify the NRGY Entities for any and
all Losses arising from or relating to the Credit Support Instruments, other
than Losses arising from Retained Propane Business Liabilities and the Other
Retained Liabilities. In the event that any Credit Support Instrument has not
been terminated and the applicable NRGY Entity has not been released as of the
Contribution Closing Date, such NRGY Entity shall be permitted to terminate
such Credit Support Instrument as promptly as possible under the terms of such
Credit Support Instrument; _provided_ , _however_ , that the termination of
such Credit Support Instrument does not result in termination or a material
change to the Contract to which such credit support applies, except in
connection with the end of any primary or renewal term of any such Contract or
Credit Support Instrument. Nothing in this  _Section 5.19_ shall be deemed
to release any NRGY Entity from the obligations of any Credit Support
Instrument relating to the Retained Propane Business Liabilities or the Other
Retained Liabilities.

 



59 Section 5.20 _Filing of Form S-1; Other Actions_.

 

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days after the filing of NRGYs Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, Acquirer shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-1 relating to the distribution of Suburban
Common Units by NRGY in the Spin-Off (including any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Form S-1_"). Acquirer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have the Form S-1 declared effective under the Securities Act within 180
days after the Contribution Closing Date and to keep the Form S-1 effective as
long as necessary to consummate the Spin-Off and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Acquirer shall also take any action required to be taken
under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Spin-Off,
and NRGY shall furnish all information concerning NRGY and the
NRGY Unitholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquirer shall not be required to
qualify or register as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not presently qualified or registered or where it would be subject to taxation
as a foreign corporation. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Form S-1 will be made by Acquirer without NRGYs prior consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without providing
NRGY a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Acquirer or NRGY,
as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral or
written notice of the time when the Form S-1 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Suburban Common Units for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Form S-1 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide the
other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state
securities commission. If at any time prior to the Spin-Off any information
relating to Acquirer or NRGY, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors, is discovered by Acquirer or NRGY which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Form S-1, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC.

(b) Acquirer shall provide access to its books and records as may be
reasonably necessary for the Contributor Parties or any of their Affiliates,
or any of their respective advisors or Representatives, to conduct customary
due diligence with respect to the financial statements of the Suburban
Entities and other information concerning the Suburban Entities contained in
or incorporated by reference into the Form S-1 or to enable an accounting firm
to prepare and deliver a customary comfort letter with respect to financial
information relating to the Suburban Entities. Acquirer shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause their independent accountants to provide any consent
necessary to the filing of the Form S-1 and to deliver a customary comfort
letter to NRGY with respect to financial information relating to the
Suburban Entities contained in the Form S-1. Acquirer shall provide such
customary representation letters as are necessary in connection therewith.

 



60 (c) The Contributor Parties shall use reasonable best effort to promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to Acquirer such information about the
Acquired Assets and the Propane Group Entities as may be required under the
Securities Act to be included in the Form S-1 (by furnishing such information
in writing), and the Contributor Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
(i) provide, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, officers and
employees to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
preparation of the Form S-1, including by permitting reasonable access to the
auditors, auditor work papers, employees books and records and any financial
data reasonably requested by Acquirer in connection therewith and (ii) cause
their independent public accountants to provide any consent necessary for the
filing of the Form S-1 and to deliver a customary comfort letter to Acquirer
with respect to financial information relating to the Propane Group Entities
contained in the Form S-1.

 

(d) NRGY shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws,
the rules of the NYSE and the Organizational Documents of NRGY to duly give
notice of the Spin-Off, and to declare a record date for such Spin-Off to
occur as promptly as practicable after the Form S-1 is declared effective
under the Securities Act.

 

(e) Each of NRGY and Inergy Sales agrees that during the period from the
Contribution Closing Date until 180 days after the Contribution Closing Date
(the " _Holding Period_ "), at any meeting of the unitholders of Acquirer,
however called, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, it shall (A)
appear at the meeting, or otherwise cause all Suburban Common Units held by
it to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum, and
(B) vote or cause all Suburban Common Units held by it to be voted in
accordance with the recommendations of the board of supervisors of Acquirer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Inergy nor
Inergy Sales shall be required to vote, or to cause the Suburban Common Units
held by each such entity to be voted, in accordance with the recommendations
of the board of supervisors of Acquirer with respect to any matter requiring
the approval or vote of the holders of Suburban Common Units, which matter if
approved would adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of NRGY
or Inergy Sales, as holders of Suburban Common Units, as compared to all
other holders of Suburban Common Units, as a class.

(f) Each of NRGY and Inergy Sales agrees that during the Holding Period, it
shall not Transfer any Suburban Common Units received as part of the Equity
Consideration, except pursuant to the Spin-Off or, with respect to Inergy
Sales, a distribution of the Inergy Sales Equity Consideration by Inergy
Sales to NRGY.

(g) NRGY hereby consents to being named as an "underwriter" in the Form S-1.

Section 5.21 _NYSE Listing_. Acquirer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Suburban Common Units comprising the Equity
Consideration to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the effective date of the Form S-1.

 



61 Section 5.22 _Employees and Benefits_.

 

(a) Prior to the Contribution Closing, NRGY shall cause the employment
(including any employment agreements (common law or otherwise)) of all
employees of Inergy Sales (" _Inergy Sales Employees_ ") to be transferred to
Inergy Propane. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, and
except for (i) any employees (other than any union employees who do not
participate in Propane Group Benefit Plans providing health and welfare
benefits) who are on a medical or other leave of absence from active
employment as of the Contribution Closing Date (such employees, including any
Inergy Sales Employees who are on a medical or other leave of absence from
active employment as of the Contribution Closing Date, " _Leave Employees_ ")
and (ii) those employees whose names or positions are set forth on
_Schedule 5.22(a)_ of the Contributor Disclosure Schedule or the Acquirer
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Excluded Employees_ ") (all of whom shall on or
prior to the Contribution Closing Date be transferred to NRGY, NRGY GP or one
of their Affiliates other than the Propane Group Entities and remain
employees of the NRGY Entities from and after the Contribution Closing Date),
upon the Contribution Closing Date, all of the Propane Group Employees
(including the Inergy Sales Employees) shall remain employees of the Propane
Group Entities. For a period of at least six (6) months following the
Contribution Closing Date, Acquirer agrees that it shall not reduce the base
salary or wage paid to any Propane Group Employee or Transferred Leave
Employee to a level that is less than the base salary (or the base wage rate)
applicable with respect to such Propane Group Employee or Transferred Leave
Employee as of the time immediately preceding the Contribution Closing
Date (or, with respect to any Transferred Leave Employee, the date such
employee returns to active service); _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
_Section 5.22(i)_, nothing contained in this section shall in any way
limit Acquirers, any of its Subsidiaries or the Propane Group Entities
rights to terminate the employment of any employee at any time following the
Contribution Closing Date. Acquirer agrees that upon a Leave Employees return
to active service with the Propane Business, the Propane Group Entities or
one of their Affiliates will offer employment (at the same base salary or
hourly wage as was in effect prior to the applicable employees leave of
absence) to such Leave Employee, provided, however, that, except with respect
to Leave Employees on military leave as of the Contribution Closing Date,
Acquirers obligation to offer employment to returning Leave Employees shall
apply only with respect to Leave Employees who return to active service with
the Propane Business within six months after the initial date of commencement
of such Leave Employees leave of absence. The foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.22(a)_ shall be subject to the terms of, and shall not apply to
the extent prohibited by, any collective bargaining agreement that may apply
with respect to a particular Leave Employee, provided that, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, NRGY, NRGY GP and their
Affiliates (other than the Propane Group Entities) shall retain all
Liabilities with respect to, and shall continue to provide health and welfare
benefit coverage to, any such Leave Employee until such Leave Employee becomes
a Transferred Leave Employee in accordance with the last sentence of this
_Section 5.22(a)_. Leave Employees who return to active service with the
Propane Group Entities or one of their Affiliates within the time period
required by this  _Section 5.22(a)_ and become employed by the Propane Group
Entities or their Affiliates upon their return to active service shall
hereinafter be referred to as "Transferred Leave Employees."

 

(b) Prior to the Contribution Closing, NRGY shall cause the Select Propane
Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 5.22(b)_ of the Contributor Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Excluded Benefit Plans_ ") to be transferred to NRGY, NRGY GP
or one of their Affiliates other than the Propane Group Entities. Effective as
of 12:01 am Eastern time on the day after the Contribution Closing Date (or,
with respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to
active service), each Propane Group Employee and Transferred Leave Employee
shall be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans provided by
Acquirer and its Affiliates (the " _Suburban Benefit Plans_ ") on the same
terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Acquirer and its
Affiliates. The Propane Group Employees and Transferred Leave Employees shall
receive credit for service with the Propane Group Entities and their
Affiliates prior to the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to
Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to active service)
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under all Suburban
Benefit Plans made available to them to the same extent such credit would be
recognized under any comparable Propane Group Benefit Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall such credit result in the duplication of
benefits or the funding thereof.

 



62 (c) NRGY shall cause the Inergy Companies 401(k) Retirement Plan (the "
_NRGY 401(k) Plan_ ") to fully vest each Propane Group Employee and
Transferred Leave Employee as of the Contribution Closing Date (or, with
respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to
active service). Each Propane Group Employee and Transferred Leave Employee
participating in the NRGY 401(k) Plan as of the Contribution Closing Date (or,
with respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to
active service) shall cease such participation on such date and shall be
given the opportunity to elect to receive a distribution of their account
balance or "rollover" such account balance (in cash, but, if permitted by
Acquirer in its sole discretion, including any promissory notes for
associated participant loans) to Acquirers 401(k) plan, subject to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan and applicable Law.
Acquirer, Suburban GP, NRGY and NRGY GP shall reasonably cooperate in order
to facilitate any such distribution or rollover and to effect an eligible
rollover distribution for those Propane Group Employees and Transferred Leave
Employees who elect to rollover their account balances directly into
Acquirers 401(k) plan.

(d) Provided that NRGY complies with its obligations under this Section
5.22(d) and the information described herein is provided to Acquirer,
Acquirer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Acquirers or its
Affiliates medical and dental plans covering the Propane Group Employees and
Transferred Leave Employees after the Contribution Closing Date (or, with
respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to
active service) (the " _Suburban Medical Plans_ ") to recognize any out-of-
pocket medical and dental expenses incurred by each of the Propane Group
Employees and Transferred Leave Employees and their eligible dependents prior
to the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to Transferred Leave
Employees, the date such employee returns to active service) and during
the calendar year in which the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to
Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to active service)
occurs for purposes of determining deductibles under the Suburban Medical
Plans. As soon as practicable after, but no later than thirty (30) days
following, the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to Transferred
Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to active service), NRGY shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its third-party benefits
administrator to, provide Acquirer a schedule in writing detailing each
Propane Group Employees and Transferred Leave Employees claims made and
deductibles paid with respect to the Propane Group Benefit Plans providing
medical and dental benefits as of the Contribution Closing Date (or, with
respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee returns to
active service). In addition, Acquirer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Suburban Medical Plans to waive all
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements and
preexisting condition limitations with respect to the Propane Group Employees
and Transferred Leave Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent
they did not apply under the comparable Propane Group Benefit Plan.

 



63 (e) Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, Acquirer shall
assume and honor, or shall cause its relevant Affiliates to assume and honor,
all liabilities for all earned or accrued but unused vacation and other paid
time off benefits of the Propane Group Employees and Transferred Leave
Employees with the Propane Group Entities (or, with respect to Transferred
Leave Employees, NRGY and its Affiliates) as of the Contribution Closing Date
(or, with respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee
returns to active service). As soon as reasonably practicable on or following
the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to Transferred Leave
Employees, the date such employee returns to active service), but no later
than ten (10) Business Days, NRGY shall provide Acquirer a schedule
in writing detailing each such Propane Group Employees and Transferred Leave
Employees earned or accrued vacation and other paid time off that has been
used from January 1, 2012 through and including the Contribution Closing Date
(or, with respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such employee
returns to active service). During the balance of the calendar year 2012
following the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to Transferred Leave
Employees, the date such employee returns to active service), if any, the
Propane Group Employees and Transferred Leave Employees shall be eligible for
vacation and other paid time off benefits under the terms of the vacation and
other paid time off benefit policies of NRGY and its Affiliates in effect as
of the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to Transferred Leave
Employees, the date such employee returns to active service). For the calendar
year 2013 and each year thereafter, the Propane Group Employees and
Transferred Leave Employees shall be eligible for vacation and other paid time
off benefits under the terms of the vacation and other paid time off benefit
policies of Acquirer and its Affiliates as in effect from time to time, in
each case after giving credit for each such Propane Group Employees and
Transferred Leave Employees service with NRGY in accordance with _Section
5.22(b)_.

(f) Both before and after the Contribution Closing Date, NRGY shall be
responsible for and discharge, and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to be
responsible for and discharge, any workers compensation liabilities in
respect of any Propane Business Personnel arising as a result of any action,
omission, failure to act or other matter or thing that occurred or occurs on
or prior to the Contribution Closing Date. Effective as of the Contribution
Closing Date (or, with respect to Transferred Leave Employees, the date such
employee returns to active service), Acquirer shall be responsible for and
discharge, and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to be responsible for
and discharge, all workers compensation liabilities in respect of Propane
Group Employees and Transferred Leave Employees arising as a result of any
action, omission, failure to act or other matter or thing that occurs after
the Contribution Closing Date (or, with respect to Transferred Leave
Employees, the date such employee returns to active service).

 



64 (g) NRGY and Acquirer agree to coordinate the transition of NRGYs health care
flexible spending account plan (the " _NRGY FSA Plan_ ") with respect to the
Propane Group Employees as described in Situation 2 of IRS Revenue Ruling
2002-32. Acquirer agrees to establish and maintain, or make provision for,
the establishment of a health care flexible spending account plan (the "
_Suburban FSA Plan_ ") applicable to the Propane Group Employees and the
election by any such Propane Group Employee under the welfare benefit plans
covering such Propane Group Employees immediately prior to the Contribution
Closing Date shall be continued as an election as if made under Acquirers
health care flexible spending account plan from the beginning of NRGYs plan
year. Acquirers health care flexible spending account plan shall provide for
reimbursement of medical care expenses incurred by the Propane Group Employees
at any time during NRGYs plan year, excluding claims incurred and paid prior
to the Contribution Closing Date, which shall remain the responsibility of
NRGY, up to the amount of the applicable Propane Group Employees election and
reduced by amounts previously reimbursed by NRGY. As soon as reasonably
practicable after, but no later than thirty (30) Business Days following, the
Contribution Closing Date, NRGY shall provide Acquirer a schedule in writing
with each Propane Group Employees health care flexible spending account
election for the plan year that includes the Contribution Closing Date and
the amount of each Propane Group Employees periodic salary reductions and the
expense reimbursements provided to the Propane Group Employees under the NRGY
FSA Plan, if any, on a claim by claim basis, as of the Contribution Closing
Date. If, as of the Contribution Closing Date, the aggregate amount reimbursed
to the Propane Group Employees under the NRGY FSA Plan for the plan year in
which the Contribution Closing Date occurs exceeds the aggregate amount of
contributions made by the Propane Group Employees to the NRGY FSA Plan for
such plan year, then, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Contribution
Closing Date, Acquirer or the Suburban FSA Plan shall pay to NRGY or the NRGY
FSA Plan an amount in cash equal to such excess. As soon as practicable
following the Contribution Closing Date, NRGY shall cause to be transferred to
the Suburban FSA Plan an amount in cash equal to the excess of the aggregate
accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts
under the NRGY FSA Plan made during the year in which the Contribution Closing
Date occurs by the Propane Group Employees over the aggregate reimbursement
payouts made for such year from such accounts to such employees. Acquirer
shall cause such amounts to be credited to each such employees corresponding
accounts under the Suburban FSA Plan in which such employees participate
following the Contribution Closing Date. The foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.22(g) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ with respect to any Transferred
Leave Employees, provided that with respect to such employees, references in
this Section 5.22(g) to the Contribution Closing Date shall be deemed to
refer to the applicable employees date of hire after the Contribution Closing
Date by Acquirer, the Propane Group Entities or any of their Affiliates.

(h) From and after the Contribution Closing Date, NRGY, NRGY GP or one of
their Affiliates other than the Propane Group Entities shall remain
responsible for all responsibilities and obligations for continuation
coverage under COBRA (" _COBRA Obligations_ ") for all individuals who are MandA
qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned to such term under QandA-4
of Section 54.4980B-9 of the Treasury Regulations) and any state continuation

provided in _Section 8.3(a)(i)(C)_, any covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part
after the Contribution Closing Date shall survive until fully discharged. The
date on which any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement no
longer survives in accordance with this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ is referred to
herein as the " _Expiration Date_."

 



75 (ii) No action for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein (other than (x) the Fundamental Representations
and (y) Losses relating to _Section 8.1(e)_ (Other Retained Liabilities) or
_Section 8.2(c)_ (Unitholder Litigation)) shall be brought after
the Expiration Date, except for claims of which a Party has received a Claim
Notice setting forth in reasonable detail the claimed misrepresentation or
breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with reasonable
detail, on or prior to the Expiration Date.

(b) _Materiality_. In determining whether a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made hereunder exists and in calculating the
amount of indemnifiable Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party arising out
of or relating to any such breach or inaccuracy, all qualifications relating
to "materiality," "material," "Material Adverse Effect" (other than in
_Section 3.10(b)_, _Section 4.8(a)_, _Section 5.1(b)(xxvi)(C)_ and _Section
5.1(d)(v)(C)_) or any similar qualification, shall be disregarded.

(c) _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement: (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any Losses pursuant to _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ (as the case may
be) unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from the Indemnifying Party exceeds an amount equal to $15,000,000
(the " _Basket_ "), after which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only
for those Losses in excess of the Basket and (ii) the maximum aggregate amount
of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an Indemnifying Party
under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ (as the case may be) shall be an amount
equal to $150,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the limitations
set forth in this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall apply to Losses arising out of (A)
the breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 3.18_ (Taxes) or  _Section 4.11_
(Taxes), (B) the breach of _Section 2.5_ or _Section 5.12_, or (C) for
Claims pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_, _Section 8.1(e)_, _Section 8.2(c)_
or  _Section 8.2(d)_. No Person may recover more than once under this
Article VIII in respect of any Loss.

 

(d) _Minimum Claim_. If any Claim or group of related Claims for
indemnification by an Indemnified Party that is indemnifiable under _Section
8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ results in respective aggregate Losses to such
Indemnified Party that do not exceed $250,000, such Losses shall not be deemed
to be Losses under this Agreement, shall not be eligible for indemnification
under this _Article VIII_ and shall not be included in the calculations of
limitation of Losses set forth in _Section 8.3(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no minimum claim amount shall apply with respect to (i) Losses arising
out of the breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.18_ (Taxes) or
_Section 4.11_ (Taxes), (ii) Losses relating to any breaches of _Section
2.5_ or _Section 5.12_, or (iii) Losses relating to _Section 8.1(c)_,
_Section 8.1(e)_, _Section 8.2(c)_ or _Section 8.2(d)_.

 



76 (e) _Calculation of Losses._ In calculating amounts payable to
any Contributor Indemnitee or Acquirer Indemnitee (each such Person, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") for a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount
of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any
other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made or could be made
under any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and shall be
computed net of (i) payments actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under
any insurance policy with respect to such Losses, net of any associated costs
of expenses of recovery, and (ii) any prior actual recovery by the Indemnified
Party from any Person with respect to such Losses.

 

(f) _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall any Party be liable to any other Party for
punitive, remote or speculative damages of any kind or nature, regardless of
the form of action through which such damages are sought, except for any such
damages recovered by any third party against an Indemnified Party in respect
of which such Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the terms hereof.

(g) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Contribution Closing Date,
except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.4_ of this Agreement, the remedies
provided in this  _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive legal
remedies of the Parties with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) Each Indemnified Party agrees that promptly after it receives notice of
any Third Party Claim against such Indemnified Party giving rise to a claim by
it for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_, such Indemnified
Party must provide reasonably prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to
the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") allegedly required to
provide indemnification protection under this _Article VIII_ specifying,
in reasonable detail, the nature and basis for such Third Party Claim (
_e.g.,_ the underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged
to have been breached) and the amount (to the extent that the nature and
amount of such Third Party Claim is known or reasonably ascertainable at such
time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such amount or estimated amount shall not
be conclusive of the final amount, if any, of such Third Party Claim).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Partys failure to send or
delay in sending a Claim Notice of a Third Party Claim will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from liability hereunder with respect to such Third Party
Claim except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure or delay and except as is otherwise provided herein, including in
_Section 8.3(f)_.

 



77 (b) Unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes, within five (5)
Business Days following its receipt of the Claim Notice, in writing its
obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that
may result from a Third Party Claim, and provides the reasons for such
dispute, the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at such Indemnifying
Partys expense, to assume the defense of same including the appointment and
selection of counsel on behalf of the Indemnified Party so long as such
counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume such
defense if (1) the Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the Third-
Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that
joint representation would be inappropriate, (2) the Indemnifying Party fails
to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial
capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification
with respect to such Third-Party Claim or (3) the Third Party Claim is
seeking injunctive relief. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, it shall within thirty (30) days of its
receipt of the Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent
unless (a) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any
violation of the rights of any Person; (b) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (c) the
Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its consent. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim, then
the Indemnified Party will be entitled, at its own cost, to participate with
the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ its own separate counsel, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnified Party has available to it one or more
defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of the
defenses or counterclaims alleged by the Indemnifying Party and which could
be materially adverse to the Indemnifying Party, and in any such event the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third Party
Claim but fails to diligently prosecute such Third Party Claim, or if the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party may assume control of such defense and in the event
it is determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Article IX_ that
the Third Party Claim was a matter for which the Indemnifying Party is
required to provide indemnification under the terms of this _Article VIII_,
the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of such
defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim (but will be entitled at its own cost to participate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Third Party Claim) if the
potential damages under the Third Party Claim could reasonably and in good
faith be expected to exceed, in the aggregate when combined with all Third
Party Claims previously made by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying
Party under this _Article VIII_, the maximum amount the Indemnifying Party
may be liable pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
to the extent the Parties are not in agreement with respect to the calculation
of potential damages, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith until the Parties
have agreed or a final non-appealable judgment has been entered into, with
respect to the determination of the potential damages. The Parties shall
render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order
to insure the proper and adequate defense of any such Third Party Claim,
including making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any relevant materials or to testify
at any Proceedings relating to such Third Party Claim.

 



78 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnified Party to any injunctive or
other non-monetary relief or any criminal liability, requires an admission of
guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party or imposes any
continuing obligation on or requires any payment from the Indemnified Party
without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent. 

(d) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the other Party from whom indemnification
is sought.

79 (b) Except as provided in _Section 7.2_, _Section 8.1_,  _Section 8.2_ and
_Section 8.3(f)_, no Party nor any Affiliate of a Party shall assert or
threaten, and each Party hereby waives and shall cause such Affiliates to

applicable Law, against any Person that is not a Party (or a successor to a
Party) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

GOVERNING LAW AND CONSENT TO JURISDICTION 

Section 9.1 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to the conflicts of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 9.2 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Except as to the determination of Final
Working Capital in accordance with _Section 2.5_, the Parties irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Delaware Court of Chancery and

relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought by it except in such courts). The Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waive (and agree not to plead or claim) any objection to the
laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the Delaware Court of Chancery or (ii)
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if

inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties also agrees that any final and non-
appealable judgment against a Party in connection with any Proceeding shall be
conclusive and binding on such Party and that such award or judgment may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of
the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

APPLICABLE LAW, ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR TO DEFEND ANY RIGHTS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

remedy referred to in this _Section 9.4_ and each Party waives any objection

Section 10.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns. For a
period of three (3) years from the date hereof, if any Person or its
Affiliates enters into one or more transactions pursuant to which it acquires
(whether through merger, asset sale or otherwise) a majority of the equity
interests in a Party or a majority of the assets of a Party (each such
acquirer, a " _Successor_ "), then such Party shall cause the Successor to,
as a condition to the consummation of such transaction(s), expressly assume
the obligations of such Party under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; provided, that no such assumption shall relieve such Party of
any obligation hereunder. In addition, for a period of three (3) years from
the date hereof, if (i) a Party desires to distribute, or distributes, to its
equityholders in one or more transactions the equity interests owned by such
Party in an Affiliate (or the consideration received therefor) and (ii) such
equity interests (or the consideration received therefor) constitute more than
50% of the consolidated assets on a fair value basis of such Party, taking
into account any prior distributions of such equity interests (or the
consideration received therefor), then such Party may effect such distribution
only if such Affiliate expressly assumes the obligations of such Party under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; provided, that no such
assumption shall relieve such Party of any obligation hereunder. Any
assumption of the obligations of a Party pursuant to the preceding two
sentences shall be (1) in writing, (2) in full, (3) unconditional, (4)
irrevocable, and (5) provided contemporaneously with the closing of the
transaction triggering such assumption No Party may assign or transfer this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_
, that (a) Acquirer may assign this Agreement or any one or more of its rights
or obligations hereunder to a Subsidiary of Acquirer that is disregarded as
an entity separate from Acquirer for U.S. federal income tax purposes without
the consent of the Contributor Parties; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
assignment by Acquirer shall not relieve Acquirer of any liability
or obligation hereunder and (b) either Party may assign any of its rights
under _Section 7.2_ (but not delegate any of its obligations) to one or more
wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries of such Party without the prior
consent of the other Party. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation
of this Agreement shall be null and void.

 



82 Section 10.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_, none of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the
benefit of or enforceable by any third party, including any creditor of any
Party or any of their Affiliates. No such third party shall obtain any right
under any provision of this Agreement or shall by reason of any such provision
make any claim in respect of any liability (or otherwise) against any other
Party.

Section 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Clean Team Agreement, which shall survive the execution of this Agreement,
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, among the Parties or between any of them with respect to such subject
matter.

 

Section 10.7 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement
will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had
never been contained herein.

Section 10.8  _Representation by Counsel_. Each of the Parties agrees that it
has been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and that it has executed the same upon the advice of such independent
counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation
of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not
be construed against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the
Parties waive the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

 



83 Section 10.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any information
(including dollar amounts) in any section of the Contributor Disclosure
Schedule or the Acquirer Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment by a Party that such information is required to be
listed on such section of the Contributor Disclosure Schedule or the Acquirer
Disclosure Schedule or is material to or outside the ordinary course of the
business of such Party or the Person to which such disclosure relates. The
information contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits and the Schedules is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
in this Agreement, the Exhibits or the Schedules shall be deemed to be an
admission by any Party to any third Person of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of a legal requirement or breach of
contract). The disclosure contained in one disclosure schedule contained in
the Contributor Disclosure Schedule or Acquirer Disclosure Schedule may be
incorporated by reference into any other disclosure schedule contained
therein, and shall be deemed to have been so incorporated into any other
disclosure schedule so long as it is readily apparent on its face that the
disclosure is applicable to such other disclosure schedule. 

Section 10.10 _Facsimiles; Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile signatures by any Party and such signature shall be deemed binding
for all purposes hereof, without delivery of an original signature being
thereafter required. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same document.
