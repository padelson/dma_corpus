Subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure letter of Seller
addressed to Buyer, dated and delivered as of the Agreement Date (the "Seller
Disclosure Letter"), which disclosures shall be numbered to correspond to the
applicable section and subsection of this _Article 3_ and shall be deemed to
apply to each other section and subsection hereof to the extent the disclosure
is reasonably apparent on its face, upon a reading of the disclosure without
any reference to extrinsic documentation or any independent knowledge on the
part of the reader regarding the matter disclosed. For avoidance of doubt, no
representation or warranty made in _Article 3_ applies to the business of
Seller other than the Company Business, except to the extent such other
business applies to or affects the business of any Group Company. Seller
hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as of the Agreement Date and the
Closing Date, as follows:

 



 

3.1. _Organization and Good Standing_ (a) . Each Group Company has
the requisite corporate or similar power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease, operate and use its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each Group
Company is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its respective organization (to
the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where such failure to be in
good standing would not be material to such Group Company. Each Group Company
is duly qualified or licensed to do business, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties and assets owned, leased, operated or used by it
or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where failure to be so qualified or licensed would not be material to
the Company. _Schedule_ _3.1_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter lists a true and
complete list of each jurisdiction in which each Group Company is so qualified
or licensed or in good standing. Seller has delivered to Buyer a complete and
correct copy of the memorandum and articles of association or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of each Group Company (the
"Group Company Organizational Documents"). Such Group Company Organizational
Documents are in full force and effect. No Group Company is in violation of
any of the provisions of its memorandum and articles of association or
equivalent organizational documents. The transactions pursuant to which Seller
acquired the Company and became the sole shareholder of the Company closed on
September 15, 2014.

 



 

3.2. _Subsidiaries_ (b) . A true and complete list of all
Subsidiaries of the Company, together with the jurisdiction of organization of
each such Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding issued share
capital or registered capital, as the case may be, of each such Subsidiary
owned by a Group Company, is set forth in _Schedule_ _3.2_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter. Except as disclosed in _Schedule_ _3.2_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter: (i) there are no other corporations, partnerships, joint
ventures, associations, or entities through which any Group Company conducts
business, or other entities in which a Group Company controls or owns, of
record or beneficially, any direct or indirect equity or other interest or
right (contingent or otherwise) to acquire the same; and (ii) no Group Company
is a participant in (nor is any part of their businesses conducted through)
any joint venture, partnership, or similar arrangement. The Company is the
direct or indirect owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of each
Subsidiary, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances), and all such shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are not subject to any preemptive right or right of
first refusal created by statute, or any organizational or governing
documents, as applicable, of such Subsidiary or any Contract to which such
Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound. There are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, "put" or "call" rights, exchangeable or
convertible securities or other Contracts of any character relating to the
issued or unissued share capital or other securities of any Subsidiary, or
otherwise obligating any Group Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire or sell any such securities.

 



 



 

 



   



 

3.3. _Power, Authorization and Validity_.

 



 

(a) _Power and Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate or
other organizational power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is

(b) _Board Approval_. The Share Purchase and the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is
a party and all other agreements, transactions and actions contemplated hereby
or thereby, have been duly and validly approved and authorized by all
necessary corporate action of the Company and do not require any further
authorization, action or consent of the Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company's Board of Directors at a meeting
duly called and held or via written consent, has unanimously (i) determined
that the Share Purchase, the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and (ii) approved and adopted the Share
Purchase, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby in accordance with the provisions of the
Cayman Islands Companies Law and the Company's memorandum and articles of
association.

 



 

(c) _Enforceability_. On the Closing Date, the Ancillary Agreements to
which the Company is a party will have been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company. Each of the Ancillary Agreements to which the
Company is a party are, or when executed by the Company shall be, legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their respective terms, in each case, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law and equity

provisions thereof. There exists no default or event of default or event,
occurrence, condition, circumstances or act, with respect to any Group Company
or to the knowledge of Seller, with respect to any other contracting party,
which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would reasonably be
expected to become a material default or event of default under any Company
Material Contract. As of the Agreement Date, none of the Group Companies has
received any written notice regarding any alleged material violation, breach
of or default under any Company Material Contract.

 



 

(b) There is no Contract, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding

(a) The Group Companies (i) own all rights to or (ii) have the valid right

termination, suspension of, or acceleration of any rights, obligations or
payments with respect to such Company IP Agreements, or give any other Person
the right to do any of the foregoing. Following the Closing, the Group
Companies will be permitted to exercise all of their rights under such Company

had the Share Purchase not occurred and without the payment of any additional
amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments that
the Group Companies would otherwise be required to pay.

 



 

(c) _Schedule_ _3.14(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a

importation, distribution, provision and/or use of any Company Product and
(ii) the Group Companies' use of any product, device or process used in the
Company Business has not, does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person and does not constitute unfair
competition or unfair trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction. To
Seller's knowledge, there is no substantial basis for a claim that the design,
development, manufacturing, reproduction, marketing, licensing, sale, offer
for sale, importation, distribution, provision and/or use of any Company
Product or the operation of the Company Business will infringe, is infringing
or has infringed on or misappropriated any Intellectual Property Rights of
another Person, or constitutes or has or will constitute unfair competition or
unfair trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, none of the Group Companies has been sued in
any Action (or to Seller's knowledge, received any written threat of an
Action) that involves a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any
Intellectual Property Right of any Person or that contests the validity or
ownership of any Company-Owned IP or right of the Group Companies to exercise
any Intellectual Property Right. None of the Group Companies has received any
written communication that involves an offer to license or grant any other
rights or immunities under any (i) issued or pending patent or (ii) other
Intellectual Property of another Person as a remedy to any Group Company's
misappropriation or infringement of any Intellectual Property. None of the
Group Companies has sought or received any written opinion of counsel as to
whether any Company Product or the operation of the Company Business infringes
or misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights of another Person.

preserve and maintain the confidentiality of the Company's material, non-

consultants and independent contractors of the Company having access to such

agreement regarding the protection of such proprietary information.

 



 

(f) Each Group Company has secured from all of its consultants, employees
and independent contractors who independently or jointly contributed to the
conception, reduction to practice, creation or development of any Company-
Owned IP unencumbered and unrestricted exclusive ownership of, all such
Persons' Intellectual Property Rights in such contribution, that such Group
Company does not already own by operation of law, by valid and enforceable
written assignments, and such Persons have not retained any rights or licenses
with respect thereto.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(g) There are no royalties, honoraria, fees or other similar payments
payable by any Group Company to any Person (other than salaries or wages
payable to employees, and fees to consultants and independent contractors not
contingent on or related to use of their work product) as a result of the
ownership, use, possession, license-in, license-out, sale, marketing,
advertising or disposition of any Company-Owned IP by any Group Company.

 



 

(h) _Schedule_ _3.14(h)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a true
and complete list, as of the Agreement Date, of all Company Registered IP.

and to the extent issued or registered, valid and enforceable. All maintenance
and renewal fees and annuity payments due for payment with respect to such
Company Registered IP have been timely paid as required to maintain such
Company Registered IP in full force and effect. _Schedule_ _3.14(h)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter sets out all actions that are required to be taken by
any Group Company within 90 days of the Agreement Date, including the payment
of any registration, maintenance, annuity or renewal fees or the filing of any
documents, applications or certificates, for the purposes of perfecting,
maintaining, or renewing any Company Registered IP.

 



 

(i) The Group Companies own and have good and exclusive title to all
Intellectual Property Rights that are Company-Owned IP, including each item of

none of the Company IP Agreements grants any third party exclusive rights to
or under any Company-Owned IP, (ii) none of the Company-Owned IP is subject to
any Action, Order, or stipulation materially restricting the use,
distribution, transfer, or licensing by the Company of any Company-Owned IP or
Company Products and (iii) there is no pending Action to which any Group
Company is a party challenging the ownership, validity scope of right or
enforceability of any Company-Owned IP and, to the knowledge of Seller, there
is no written threat of any such Action.

 



 

(j) None of the Group Companies has transferred ownership of any
Intellectual Property Rights that are or were Company-Owned IP, to any third
party, or, except pursuant to such Group Company's reasonable business
judgment, knowingly permitted such Group Company's rights in any Intellectual
Property Rights that are or were Company-Owned IP to enter the public domain
prior to registration of any such Intellectual Property Rights or, with
respect to any Intellectual Property Rights for which such Group Company has
submitted an application or obtained a registration, lapse (other than through
the expiration of Company Registered IP at the end of its maximum statutory
term).

 



 

(k) Neither the execution and delivery or effectiveness of this Agreement
nor the performance of the Company's obligations under this Agreement will
cause the forfeiture or termination of, or give rise to a right of forfeiture
or termination of any Company-Owned IP, or impair the right of Buyer, any
Group Company to use, possess, sell or license any Company-Owned IP or portion
thereof. After the Closing, all Company-Owned IP will be fully transferable,
alienable or licensable by the Group Companies without restriction, and
without payment of any kind to any third party.

 



 

(l) _Schedule_ _3.14(l)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter identifies each
Contract pursuant to which any Group Company has deposited or is obligated to
deposit Company Source Code with an escrow agent for the benefit of another
party and except as set forth in such Contracts, none of the Group Companies
nor any other Person then acting on their behalf has otherwise disclosed,
delivered or licensed to any Person, agreed to disclose, deliver or license to
any Person, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or
other Person of, any Company Source Code.. No event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that will, or could reasonably be expected
to, result in the delivery, license, or disclosure of any such escrowed
Company Source Code to any Person. 

 



 



 

 



   



 

(m) To Seller's knowledge, there is no material unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any material Company-Owned IP

for infringement or misappropriation of any Company IP or breach of any
Company IP Agreement.

 



 

(n) The Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of all
licenses for the Open Source Materials. None of the Group Companies has
incorporated, distributed or combined Open Source Materials into or with any
Company Products or Company-Owned IP, or otherwise used Open Source Materials,
in such a way that grants to any Person any rights or immunities under any
Company-Owned IP (including any requirement that any Company-Owned IP be (i)
disclosed or distributed in source code form, (ii) licensed for the purpose of
making derivative works or (iii) redistributable at no charge).

 



 

(o) All Company Products sold, licensed, leased or delivered by the Group
Companies to customers and all services provided by or through the Group
Companies to customers on or prior to the Closing Date conform in all material
respects to applicable contractual commitments, express and implied warranties
(to the extent not subject to legally effective express exclusions thereof),
and conform in all material respects to advertising and marketing materials
and to applicable product or service specifications or documentation. None of
the Group Companies has any Liability (and, to the knowledge of Seller, there
is no legitimate basis for any present or future Action against any Group
Company giving rise to any material Liability relating to the foregoing
obligations) for replacement or repair of Company Products or other damages in
connection therewith in excess of any reserves therefor reflected on the
Company Balance Sheet.

 



 

(p) The Company has implemented and maintains reasonable and appropriate
disaster recovery and security plans, procedures and facilities, consistent

the Seller Disclosure Letter, to Seller's knowledge, there has been no
material breach of security or unauthorized access by third parties to the
Company IT Systems since September 15, 2014. To Seller's knowledge, and except
as would not have a material impact on the Company Business, the Company IT
Systems operate and perform in all material respects in accordance with their
documentation and functional specifications and otherwise as required by the
Company Business.

 



 

(q) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will result in Buyer or any of its Affiliates granting to any third
party any right to or with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by, or
licensed to, Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(r) The Company has provided, or made available to Buyer, all requested
and reasonably accessible material, documentation and notes relating to the
testing of all Company Products. The Group Companies have documented all
material bugs, errors and defects in all the Company Products known to and in
possession of the Group Companies, and such documentation is retained and is

independent contractor who was involved in, or who contributed to, the

any government, university, college or other educational institution or
research center during a period of time during which such employee, consultant
or independent contractor was also performing services for a Group Company.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(t) Neither Seller nor any Group Company is now or has ever been a member
or promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any
similar organization that could reasonably be expected to require or obligate
a Group Company to grant or offer to any other Person any license or right to
any Company-Owned IP. In addition, if any Company-Owned IP were acquired from
a Person other than an employee of or contractor to a Group Company, then, to
Seller's knowledge, such Person was not, at the time of such acquisition, a
member or promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any
similar organization that could reasonably be expected to have required or
obligated such Person to grant or offer to any other Person any license or
right to such Company-Owned IP. Neither Seller nor any Group Company has a
present obligation to grant or offer to any other Person any license or right
to any Company-Owned IP by virtue of the Group Company's membership in,
promotion of, or contributions to any industry standards body or any similar
organization.

Law or Order. To the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred and no
condition exists that would reasonably be expected to (with or without notice

Company, or a failure on the part of any Group Company to comply with, any
Applicable Law to it or the Company Business.

 



 

(b) Each Group Company holds all material permits, licenses, certificates,
registrations and approvals from, and has made all material filings with, any

associated with the Company Business (including any Relevant Service
Provider). None of the ERISA Group Companies (other than the Company and Group
Companies) is liable for the payment to any trust or other fund or to any

Company Benefit Arrangement and Affiliate Plan (to the extent applicable to a
Relevant Service Provider), and with respect to each state workers'

liability (whether actual or contingent, direct or indirect) to provide
compensation or benefits to or for the benefit of any Relevant Service
Provider or any Prior Service Provider (in each case (X) and (Y), inclusive of
any liabilities or benefits with respect to spouses, beneficiaries or
dependents): (A) an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), which for the avoidance of doubt will
include the Exar Corporation 401(k) Plan, (B) an outstanding loan to a
Relevant Service Provider from an ERISA Group Company (other than advances of
wages in the ordinary course of business) and (C) a plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement which provides any of the following: insurance
coverage (including any self-insured arrangements that are clearly identified
as such, and any stop-loss insurance policies issued in connection with such
self-insured arrangements), workers' compensation benefits, vacation or paid-
time-off benefits, severance or termination benefits, retention, transaction
or change in control compensation or benefits, disability benefits, death
benefits, accident benefits, hospitalization benefits, medical benefits,
dental benefits, vision care benefits, cafeteria benefits, child/dependent
care benefits, sabbatical, pension, supplemental retirement or retirement
benefits, deferred compensation, excess benefit, incentive compensation,
compensatory equity or equity-based, flex spending benefits, tuition benefits,
material welfare fringe benefits, profit-sharing or bonuses, or other material
compensation or benefits, except to the extent such plan, policy or
arrangement is provided by the Company or a Group Company to comply with Law
and the Company's or Group Company's obligations is limited to making
contributions or deposits of employer contributions and/or employee
withholdings with respect to such plan, policy or arrangement to comply with
Law. Any arrangements maintained by Seller, or any ERISA Affiliate of Seller
other than the Company or a Group Company that would be Company Benefit
Arrangements maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or otherwise supported by
those entities but are not Company Benefit Arrangements due to the application
of clauses (X) and \- (Y) in this _Section_ _3.16(g)_ will be referred to as
"Affiliate Plans". Following the Closing, neither Buyer, nor any Group Company
will incur any obligation or Liability, whether contingent or otherwise, with
respect to any Affiliate Plan. Except as set forth on _Schedule_ _3.16(g)(ii)_
to the Seller Disclosure Letter, no ERISA Group Company, sponsors or
maintains, or has sponsored or maintained, any self-funded Employee Plan,
including any plan to which a stop-loss policy applies.

 



 

(ii) Each Company Benefit Arrangement and, except for situations where no
Liability could by application of Applicable Law or Contract be imputed on
Buyer, no Affiliate Plan has been operated, administered and maintained in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by Applicable Laws. Unless otherwise indicated in _Schedule_
_3.16(g)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, each such Company Benefit
Arrangement or Affiliate Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code (A) has received a favorable opinion, advisory, notification
and/or determination letter, as applicable, that such plan satisfied the
requirements of all current Applicable Laws (a copy of which letter(s) have
been delivered to Buyer and its counsel), and nothing has occurred since the
issuance of such opinion, advisory, notification and/or determination letter,
as applicable, which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the
tax-qualified status of such Company Benefit Arrangement or Affiliate Plan,
(B) is subject to an application to the Internal Revenue Service for such
letter or has a remaining period of time to apply for such letter or (C)
relies on a favorable IRS opinion letter or advisory letter issued to the
master and prototype or volume submitter plan sponsor of such employee pension
benefit plan in accordance with Internal Revenue Service guidance for reliance
on such opinion or advisory letters (a copy of which letter(s) have been
delivered to Buyer and its counsel). Each trust established in connection with
any Company Benefit Arrangement or Affiliate Plan which is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so
exempt, and no fact or event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the exempt status of any such trust.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(iii) The participation of each Group Company in each Company Benefit
Arrangement sponsored by Seller or its ERISA Affiliate (other than a Group
Company) can be terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in
accordance with its terms (without liability to the Company or Buyer) and
except as set forth on _Schedule_ _3.16(g)(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, (A) each employment Contract with respect to which the Company has or
may have any liability or with any Relevant Service Provider may be amended or
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing without liability to
the Company or Buyer except as provided by Law, and (B) each consulting
Contract with respect to which the Company has or may have any liability or
with any Relevant Service Provider may be amended or terminated or otherwise
discontinued after the Closing without liability to the Company or Buyer in
excess of US$100,000. All claims incurred by the Company as of the Closing
Date (and for avoidance of doubt without regard to actions of the Buyer or
Group Companies after the Closing) under any Company Benefit Arrangement that
is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA that
is self-insured will be paid by the Company or accrued on the Company
financial statements no later than the Closing Date to the extent such claim
is payable by the Company or for which the Company, Buyer or the Group
Companies may have Liability pursuant to the operation of Applicable Laws or
Contract.

 



 

(iv) The Company has delivered to Buyer and its legal counsel a complete
and correct copy and description of each Company Benefit Arrangement,
including all plan documents, adoption agreements, and amendments and
restatements thereto as in effect at any time during the 12-month period
preceding the Closing, trust documents, financial statements, insurance
(including any stop-loss insurance policies pertaining to a self-insured
Company Benefit Arrangement), current vendor contracts, employee booklets,
summary plan descriptions, other authorizing documents, and any material
employee communications relating thereto, and any non-routine correspondence
within the last three years with any Governmental Authority relating thereto.

 



 

(v) The Company and Seller has timely filed and delivered to Buyer and its
legal counsel the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) for each
Company Benefit Arrangement or Affiliate Plan that is subject to ERISA and
Code reporting requirements, including all attachments, schedules, financial
statements and accountants' opinions attached thereto. All reports, returns
and similar documents with respect to each Company Benefit Arrangement or
Affiliate Plan required to be filed with any Governmental Authority or
distributed to any participant of each Company Benefit Arrangement have been
duly and timely filed or distributed.

 



 

(vi) No Action is pending or has been brought, or to the knowledge of
Seller, is threatened against or with respect to any Company Benefit
Arrangement, or the assets, fiduciaries or administrators thereof, including
any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Department of
Labor which would reasonably result in Liability to Buyer or the Group
Companies. Neither the Company, nor, to Seller's knowledge, any fiduciary of a
Company Benefit Arrangement or Affiliate Plan, has ever been a participant in
any "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA with
respect to any Company Benefit Arrangement or Affiliate Plan which was not
otherwise exempt pursuant to Section 408 of ERISA (including any individual
exemption granted under Section 408(a) of ERISA) or that could result in an
excise tax under the Code or the assessment of a civil penalty under Section
502(i) of ERISA which would reasonably result in Liability to Buyer or the
Group Companies. Since September 14, 2014, the Company has not made any filing
in respect of any Company Benefit Arrangement or any Affiliate Plan under the
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the Department of Labor
Delinquent Filer Program. With respect to each Company Benefit Arrangement and
Affiliate Plan (A) no Person has, materially breached its fiduciary duty or
otherwise failed to materially act or materially comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of such Company Benefit Arrangement
or Affiliate Plan, and (B) no lien has been imposed under the Code, ERISA or
any other Applicable Law, which in either case would reasonably result in
liability to the Company.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(vii) No Company Benefit Arrangement is maintained through a human
resources and benefits outsourcing entity, professional employer organization,
or other similar vendor or provider. Neither the Company nor Buyer shall have
any liability to any employee or to any organization or any other entity as a
result of the termination of any employee leasing arrangement.

 



 

(viii) During the preceding three (3) plan years, there has been no
termination or partial termination of any Company Benefit Arrangement or
Affiliate Plan with respect to a plan subject to and within the meaning of
Section 411(d)(3) of the Code.

 



 

(ix) Other than as provided in _Schedule_ _3.16(g)(ix)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, no Company Benefit Arrangement or Affiliate Plan with
respect to which the Company has had or has any Liability (other than, as the
case may be, life insurance arrangements providing benefits for individuals
who die while actively employed with the Company) provides post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits to any Person for any reason, except as may be
required by COBRA or other Applicable Law, and there has been no communication
to any Person that could reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee any
such benefits.

 



 

(h) None of the ERISA Group Companies has any liability or obligation
(whether actual or contingent) with respect to any arrangement which
constitutes, or has since the enactment of ERISA, constituted, (i) a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (ii) a plan
sponsored by more than one employer as defined in ERISA or Code Section
413(c), (iii) a "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Code Section 419,
(iv) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA) or (v) any single employer plan or other pension plan
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and
neither the Company nor any Group Company is reasonably expected to have
liability with respect to any such plans.

 



 

(i) Each of the Company Benefit Arrangements and Affiliate Plans is in
compliance with the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions
of the Consolidation Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
("COBRA") and the regulations thereunder, or any similar state statute and
there are no outstanding, uncorrected COBRA violations, with respect to any of
the Company Benefit Arrangements and Affiliate Plans, covered employees or
qualified beneficiaries that would be reasonably likely to result in a
liability to the Company, or Buyer. Each of the ERISA Group Companies is in
compliance in all respects with (i) the applicable requirements of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations (including
the proposed regulations) thereunder and (ii) the applicable requirements of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended. No Company
Benefit Arrangement is a voluntary employee benefit association under Section
501(a)(9) of the Code.

 



 

(j) To the knowledge of Seller, no Relevant Service Provider or Prior
Service Provider is in violation of (i) any Contract with the Company or (ii)
any restrictive covenant relating to the right of any such Person to be
employed by or render services to the Company or to use trade secrets or
proprietary information of others.

 



 

(k) Unless otherwise indicated in _Schedule_ _3.16(k)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter or as would impute no Liability onto Buyer under Contract or
Applicable Law, no Relevant Service Provider is a party to any Contract or
arrangement with any ERISA Group Company providing any guaranteed term of
employment or outstanding and unfulfilled compensation guarantee.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(l) All payments, benefits, contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) and premiums
payable to or for the benefit of any Relevant Service Provider or any Prior
Service Provider, including all wages, salaries, commissions, and bonuses, and
other material benefits and other compensation, had been timely paid or made
in full as of the Balance Sheet Date or, to the extent not yet due as of the
Balance Sheet Date, properly accrued on the Company Balance Sheet in
accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Arrangement and Affiliate
Plans and all Applicable Laws. All unpaid Liabilities of the Group Companies
as of the Closing Date for (A) any wage, bonus, commission, or vacation pay,
or accrued overtime, or other employee benefits (such as fringe benefits)
which would result in Liability to the Group Companies or their ERISA
Affiliates to any Relevant Service Provider or any Prior Service Provider in
respect of service occurring on or prior to the Closing and (B) the employer
portion of payroll taxes that may be owed in respect of the foregoing, will be
accrued as liabilities in the calculation of Company Net Working Capital but
without duplication of any such Liability otherwise accrued on the Company
Balance Sheet (in each case, other than any amounts that become due as a
result of any action taken after Closing, including but not limited to any
Liability related to the termination of any Relevant Service Providers after
Closing). Any determination of Liability under this _Section_ _3.16(l)_ or
_Section_ _6.14_ shall be computed in good faith based on the period of
service to which such Liability is directly allocable or if such Liability is
not directly allocable to service prior to or following the Closing, on a pro-
rata basis as to the actual period elapsed between the commencement of the
performance period and the Closing, over the total performance period or
fiscal year, as applicable, subject to further adjustment only for a
reasonable assessment what level of achievement against target would have been
paid to the applicable Relevant Service Providers, but in all cases,
disregarding any conditions (such as continued service) that have yet to be
fulfilled as of the Closing. For purposes of this Section 3.16(l), payment due
under the IML Patent Incentive Program are treated as attributable to services
on the date a bonus under such plan become payable.

 



 

(m) Except for Company Benefit Arrangements or Affiliate Plans intended
primarily as equity compensation plans, none of the Company Benefit
Arrangements, nor any trust created thereunder, now directly holds or held as
assets any equity interests or securities issued by the Company, Seller, or
any ERISA Affiliate thereof.

 



 

(n) During the three years prior to the date of this Agreement, there has
been no "plant closing", or employee "mass layoff" (in each case, as defined
in the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988 (as amended,
the "WARN Act") or any similar state or local statute, rule or regulation)
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of any Group Company or any WARN-
type event as defined by Applicable Law.

 



 

(o) _Schedule _ _3.16(o)_ describes as relates to any Relevant Service
Provider and any Prior Service Provider (or their dependents) (a) each plan,
Contract, scheme, or Company Benefit Arrangement, (each, a "Change in Control
Agreement") (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include arrangements in
addition to those constituting Change in Control Payments) (i) pursuant to
which any amounts may become payable (whether currently or in the future) as a
result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (whether
alone or in combination with another event, contingent or otherwise) or any
agreement, document or instrument entered into in connection with such
transactions or (ii) which provides for the acceleration or early vesting of
any right or benefit or lapse of any restriction as a result of or in
connection with such transactions (whether alone or in combination with
another event, contingent or otherwise), in each case including any such plan,
scheme, Contract, or Company Benefit Arrangement with respect to which such
transactions constitute a "trigger" without regard to whether such plan,
scheme, Contract, Company Benefit Arrangement is a "single trigger" or "double
trigger" plan and (b) a summary of the nature and amounts that may become
payable pursuant to each such Change in Control Agreement.

6.10. _Intercompany Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, it is understood and agreed as follows:

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to,
cause any Debt of the Company (other than Company Intercompany Liabilities) to
be repaid and/or assumed by Seller or its Affiliates, with the intention that
the Company Closing Debt be as close to zero as reasonably practicable.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to,
cause the Company Intercompany Liabilities to be extinguished in their
entirety (including through a reasonably required dividend or capital
contribution).

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to,
cause the Company Intercompany Assets to be extinguished in their entirety
(including through a reasonably required dividend or capital contribution).

 



 

(d) Effective as of the Closing, other than (x) pursuant to this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and (y) as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 6.12_
of the Seller Disclosure Letter (which Schedule may be amended from time to
time prior to the Closing to reflect any mutually agreed additions or
deletions), (i) Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, cause all
Intercompany Contracts listed on _Schedule_ _6.10(d)_ _(i)_ ("Terminable
Intercompany Contracts") to be terminated, without any party or their
respective Affiliates having any continuing obligations or benefits thereunder
and (ii) Seller shall cause the Company to no longer receive any products or
services or have any obligations under any of the Shared Contracts listed on
_Schedule_ _6.10(d)_ _(ii)_ ("Terminable Shared Contracts").

 



 

6.11. _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) As a material inducement and consideration for Buyer to enter into
this Agreement, for a period of three years following the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), Seller agrees that it will not, and it will not permit
any Seller Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, in any capacity (including
as agent, consultant, advisor, independent contractor, general partner,
stockholder, investor, lender or guarantor of any corporation, partnership or
other entity) participate or engage in the design, development, manufacture,
production, marketing, sale or servicing of any product, or the provision of
any service, that competes with any part of the Company Business or render any
services to any business engaged in the design, manufacture or sale of any
product, or provision of any service, that competes with any part of, the
Company Business (collectively, the "Restricted Business") anywhere in the
world (the "Restricted Territory") other than as agreed in writing by the
parties under the Transition Services Agreement, License and Technology
Agreement or other written agreement; _provided, however_ , that this
_Section_ _6.11_ _(a)_ shall not be applicable to any Person (and such
Person's Affiliates) that enters into a Seller Acquisition to the extent that
such Person or any of its Affiliates is engaging in the Restricted Business
prior to signing of the definitive agreement pursuant to which such Seller
Acquisition will be consummated.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) As a material inducement and consideration for each party to enter
into this Agreement, each party agrees that, during the Restricted Period,
each such party shall not, and each such party shall not permit any of their
Subsidiaries (in the case of Buyer, including the Guarantors), to, within the
Restricted Territory, directly or indirectly solicit away or attempt to
solicit away any employees or consultants of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries (and in the case of Buyer, including the Company following the
Closing and Guarantors) ("Disallowed Workers"), for such party's or any of
such party's Affiliate's own benefit or for the benefit of any other Person or
Entity. However, this _Section _ _6.11_ will not prevent either party from
making generalized searches for employees or service providers by causing to
be placed any general advertisement or similar notices in media and in other
forms directed to the general public (including newspapers, television, radio
and Internet job boards), _provided_ that such searches are not targeted
specifically at the other party's Disallowed Workers. For the purposes of this
Agreement, Seller Disallowed Workers shall exclude the individuals listed in
_Schedule_ _6.11_ _(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agree that the duration and geographic
scope of the non-compete and the non-solicitation provisions set forth in this
_Section _ _6.11_ __ are reasonable. If any covenant in this _Section _
_6.11_ is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any court of
competent jurisdiction or any other Governmental Authority, it is agreed and
understood that such covenant will not be voided but rather will be construed
to impose limitations upon the activities of Seller that are no greater than
allowable under then applicable laws. In the event of a breach of any of the
covenants set forth in this _Section _ _6.11_ , either party will be entitled
to an injunction against the other party and any of the other party's
Subsidiaries (in the case of Buyer, including the Guarantors) restraining such
breach in addition to any other remedies provided by law or equity. In
addition, in the event of any such breach, in addition to any such remedies,
the Restricted Period with respect to the breaching party shall be
automatically extended by a number of days equal to the total number of days
in the period from the date on which such breach shall have first occurred
through the date as of which such breach shall have been fully cured,
__provided__ _,_ _ _however__ that if such non-breaching party shall not have
notified the breaching party of any such breach within 30 days after such non-
breaching party has obtained actual knowledge (which in case of the Buyer,
shall include actual knowledge of the Guarantors) that a breach has occurred,
the Restricted Period shall not be extended for the period between the non-
breaching party's obtaining such actual knowledge and it so notifying the
breaching party.

 



 

6.12. _Preparation of Tax Returns and Financial Statements_.

 



 

From and after the Closing Date, in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Returns of a Group Company or preparation of financial statements with respect
to any Group Company, upon reasonable prior notice, Seller shall (i) afford
Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the offices, properties, books, data,
files, information and records available to Seller and its Affiliates in
respect of such Group Company and its business, assets or operations
(including Tax Returns filed by such Group Company on a standalone basis
("Company Standalone Tax Returns") and other information and documents
relating to taxes imposed on or with respect to such Group Company, its
business, assets or operations, but only to the extent that such information
can reasonably be segregated from any other information that is related to
Seller and its Affiliates (other than a Group Company)), (ii) furnish to Buyer
and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives such additional
financial data and other information regarding such Group Company as Buyer,
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives may from time to time
reasonably request (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Company Standalone
Tax Returns and other information and documents relating to taxes imposed on
or with respect to such Group Company, its business, assets or operations, but
only to the extent that such information can reasonably be segregated from any
other information that is related to Seller and its Affiliates (other than a
Group Company)), and (iii) make available to Buyer and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives the employees of Seller in respect of such
Group Company and its business but if and only to the extent that the
assistance of such employees is necessary to assist Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with Buyer's or such Affiliates' inquiries for any of the purposes
referred to above; _provided_ and only to the extent that such investigation
or assistance, as applicable, does not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



 



 

 



   



 

6.13. _No Encumbrances_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall obtain and
effect the full release and discharge, effective at or prior to the Closing,

Providers in any and all Company Benefit Arrangements which are sponsored by
Seller or its ERISA Affiliate (other than the Group Companies (including those
Company Benefit Arrangements that are "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of ERISA and those intended to constitute a Section 401(k)
arrangement) and Seller shall exclusively bear the cost of such terminations.
The cost of termination of any such Company Benefit Arrangement with respect
to the Continuing Service Providers which is not paid prior to Closing by a
Group Company and which is not paid by Seller directly, shall be accrued as a
Liability in Company Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding the preceding, (i)
Seller and the Company shall not terminate the terms of any employment
contract which is included as a Company Benefit Arrangement, (ii) unless Buyer
notifies Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing to terminate
the participation of the Continuing Service Providers as participants in the
Exar Corporation Sales Incentive Plan as of the Closing, such participants
shall continue to participate in a sales incentive plan sponsored by the Group
Companies which subject to such amendments adopted by the Group Companies
provides for same terms as in effect under the Seller's Sales Incentive Plan
as of the Closing, and (iii) the cost and Liability for potential bonuses due
for outstanding awards pending under the Patent Incentive Program as of the
Closing shall be determined under Section 3.16(l). The benefits upon
termination of the Continuing Service Providers from Seller's Management
Incentive Program, Key Incentive Program and Profit Sharing Incentive Program
shall be determined by Seller in good faith based on the amount that Seller
anticipates would have been paid to such Continuing Service Providers had they
continued to participate in such programs until the applicable payment date,
pro-rated for the actual performance achieved from the beginning of the
applicable performance period to the Closing, and, subject to applicable Tax
withholding, shall be payable as provided in such programs in the form of
Seller's stock with applicable Tax withholding to the extent unpaid at the
Closing included as a Liability in Company Net Working Capital consistent with
the methodologies set forth in Section 3.16(l).

 



 

(b) Seller hereby consents to the continued employment by Relevant Service
Providers by Buyer (or a subsidiary or other Affiliate of Buyer) as employees
or independent contractors and waives, with respect to the employment or
engagement by Buyer (or a subsidiary or other Affiliate of Buyer) of such
Continuing Service Provider, any claims or rights Seller may have against
Buyer (or a subsidiary or other Affiliate of Buyer) or any such Continuing
Employee under any non-competition or non-solicitation, or as applicable
solely to the Company Business (and not Seller's other business not
contemplated to transfer hereunder to Buyer), any confidentiality, employment,
or consulting agreement, to the extent such Continuing Employees will perform
services for Buyer (or a subsidiary or other Affiliate of Buyer).

 



 

6.15. _Covenant Not to Sue_. Seller agrees that it will not, and it will
not permit any Seller Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, in any capacity
(including as agent, consultant, or advisor to any Person) assert or threaten
to assert any Seller Patent against any Company Product that exists as of the
Closing Date or derivatives thereof. If any Seller Patent is sold,
transferred, exclusively licensed or enforcement rights granted to any Person,
Seller will require such Person to agree in writing to the covenant in this

BUYER COVENANTS

 



 

During the time period from the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of
(a) the Closing or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of _Article 11_ , Buyer covenants and agrees with Seller as
follows:

 



 

7.1. _Advice of Changes_. Buyer shall promptly advise Seller in writing
of (a) any events, circumstances and facts occurring subsequent to the
Agreement Date that would render any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in _Article 5_ untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set
forth in _Section _ _9.1_ would not be satisfied, (b) any breach of any
covenant or obligation of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreement to which it is a party such that the condition set forth in _Section
_ _9.2_ would not be satisfied or (c) any change, event, circumstance,
condition or effect that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
other conditions set forth in _Article 9_ not to be satisfied.

 



 

7.2. _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the
conditions precedent that are set forth in _Article 9_ as promptly as
practicable, and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Share Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

7.3. _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the appropriate Group
Company to offer employment to and employ the Transferring Employees,
including employees on leave as of the Closing, with such employment effective
not later than the Closing, _provided that_ , the terms and conditions of
employment shall be the same as immediately prior to the transfer. Each
employee or contractor of any of the Group Companies immediately prior to the
Closing and who remains an employee or contractor of the Group Companies or
becomes an employee or contractor of Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer)
immediately following the Closing Date, together with any Transferring
Employee who accepts a transfer of employment to a Group Company , shall be a
"Continuing Service Provider." 

 



 

(b) Buyer further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall and shall cause any Affiliate of Buyer to grant all of its Continuing
Service Providers credit for any service with a Group Company or its affiliate
or predecessor earned prior to the Closing Date for eligibility and vesting
purposes under each benefit plan offered to Continuing Service Providers
following the Closing, _provided_ that such service credit does not result in
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. In addition, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which, for clarity, shall not
require Buyer to adopt any benefit programs) to cause any deductible, co-
insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before the Closing
Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of any Group Company to be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
co-insurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date under
any applicable Company Benefit Arrangement that may be established or
maintained by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer after the Closing in the year of
initial participation. 

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to maintain or continue in effect
any Company Benefit Arrangement or any other arrangements, and following the
Closing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent Buyer and its
Affiliates from amending, modifying or terminating any such Company Benefit
Arrangement, or other arrangements as determined by Buyer or such Affiliate in
their sole discretion.

prohibiting the Share Purchase or any other material transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

11.4. _Termination Fee_ (a) . In the event (a) Seller has fully

pursuant to _Section_ _11.2(b)_ following the Extended Termination Date if, on
the date of such termination (A) a Specified Circumstance exists, (B) each of
the conditions set forth in _Article 10_ (other than _Section_ _10.6_ ) is
satisfied or has been validly waived (other than the conditions that, by their
terms, are intended to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions, as of
the date of such termination, only need to be capable of being satisfied at

less than five Business Days) to waive in writing the condition set forth in
_Section_ _s_ _10.6(a)_ and _10.6(b)_ prior to the termination by Seller, in
which case Seller may no longer so terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ _11.2(a)_ provided Buyer certifies it is capable of consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby and paying the Share Purchase Consideration
(other than the Escrow Cash) to Seller upon the Closing and depositing the
Escrow Cash with the Escrow Agent thereafter), then Buyer shall, within five
(5) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid
to Seller RMB equivalent of US$6,500,000 ("Termination Fee") by instructing
the Termination Fee Deposit Bank to release the Termination Fee to Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of a termination by Buyer under
_Section_ _11.2(b)_ after the Extended Termination Date, Buyer shall not be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee under this _Section_ _11.4_ if Seller's
failure to perform any covenant, agreement or obligation hereunder was a cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Extended Termination Date. Buyer shall place the Termination Fee in
immediately available RMB in a separate account with a Beijing Branch of HSBC
or another bank (the "Termination Fee Deposit Bank") mutually agreed by Buyer
and Seller no later than thirty calendar days following execution of this
Agreement and hold such funds in such account until the earlier of (x) Buyer
instructing the Termination Fee Deposit Bank release of the Termination Fee in
accordance with this _Section_ _11.4_ or (y) returned to Buyer upon Closing or
upon termination of this Agreement under provisions that do not otherwise
provide for payment of the Termination Fee to Seller. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller's sole and exclusive
remedy if either Buyer or Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ _11.2(b)_ after the Extended Termination Date or _Section_ _11.2(a)_
_, in each case,_ __ based on a Specified Order, shall be receipt of the
Termination Fee from Buyer (or to seek such Termination Fee from the
Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee) in accordance with the terms hereof, and
upon Buyer's or Seller's termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
_11.2(b)_ after the Extended Termination Date or _Section_ _11.2(a)_ _, in
each case,_ based on a Specified Order and receipt of the Termination Fee,
Seller shall be precluded from any other remedy against Buyer and its
Affiliates at law or in equity or otherwise. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this _Section_ _11.4_ are an integral part of the
Agreement and the Share Purchase and that, without these agreements, neither
Buyer nor Seller would enter into this Agreement. In the event that Buyer (or
Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee) shall fail to pay the Termination Fee
required pursuant to this _Section_ _11.4_ when due, such Termination Fee, as
the case may be, shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date
such Termination Fee became past due, at the rate of interest per annum equal
to the "Prime Rate" as set forth on the date such payment became past due in
_The Wall Street Journal_ "Money Rates" column. In addition, if Buyer (or
Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee) shall fail to pay such Termination Fee
when due, Buyer (or Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee) shall also pay to
Seller all of Seller's costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred
by Seller in connection with efforts to collect such Termination Fee.

purposes of determining the amount of the Damages that are the subject matter
of a claim for indemnification thereunder, _provided, however_ , that the
operation of this parenthetical shall not alter the meaning of the defined
terms such as "Company Material Contract" to "Company Contract" or "Material
Adverse Effect" to "Effect" for such purposes); (ii) any breach of or default
in connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by Seller in this
Agreement; (iii) Excluded Taxes; (iv) any Change in Control Payments or Tax

Seller and its Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, members, stockholders, partners, agents and representatives (each
hereinafter referred to individually as a "Seller Indemnified Person" and
collectively as "Seller Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all
Damages based upon, relating to, arising out of or resulting from any of the
following (the "Seller Indemnifiable Matters" and, together with the Buyer
Indemnifiable Matters, the "Indemnifiable Matters"): (i) breach or inaccuracy

Breach by or on behalf of Buyer.

 



 



 

 



   



 

12.3. _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification in respect
of any claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to _Section_ _12.2(a)_
_(i)_ or _Section_ _12.2(b)_ _(i)_ (and does not involve a Fundamental
Representation or fraud, intentional misrepresentation or Willful Breach)
unless and until the amount of Damages that have finally been determined to be
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section_ _12.2(a)_ _(i)_ or _Section_ _12.2(b)_
_(i)_ exceeds US$650,000 (the "Threshold"). Once the Threshold has been
reached, the Indemnified Person may be indemnified for all Damages (including
the amount of the Threshold).

 



 

(b) If the Share Purchase is consummated, recovery of up to an amount
equal to US$13,600,000 (the "General Indemnification Limit") (which amount is
inclusive of the Escrow Cash and the Seller IP Rep Limit in the case of the
Buyer Indemnifiable Matters) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement for the Indemnifiable Matters, except in the case of (i) any failure
of the Seller IP Rep to be true and correct as aforesaid in which case Seller
shall be liable for the amount of any Damages resulting therefrom; _provided,
however_ , that such liability shall be limited to an amount equal to
US$34,000,000 (which amount is inclusive of the General Indemnification Limit)
(the "Seller IP Rep Limit"), (ii) any failure of any of the Fundamental
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid, and (iii) any matters
listed in _Section_ _12.2(a)_ _(ii)-(_ _vii_ _)_ and _Section_ _12.2(b)_
_(ii)-(_ _iii_ _)_ (collectively, the "Fundamental Matters"). In the case of
the Fundamental Matters, Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall be liable for
the amount of any Damages resulting therefrom; _provided, however_ , that such
liability shall be limited to an amount equal to US$136,000,000 minus the
Company Net Working Capital Shortfall (inclusive of the General
Indemnification Limit and the Seller IP Rep Limit), except (x) in the case of
any matters listed in _Section_ _12.2(a)_ _(_ _ix_ _)_ , for which Seller
shall be liable for the full amount of any Damages resulting therefrom without
limitation, and (y) in the case of any matters listed in _Section_ _12.2(b)(_
_iii)_ , for which Buyer shall be liable for the full amount of any Damages
resulting therefrom without limitation. For avoidance of doubt, the aggregate
amount recovered by Buyer in accordance with this Article 12 with respect to
matters that are subject to the Seller IP Rep Limit, together with the
aggregate amount recovered by Buyer in accordance with this Article 12 with
respect to matters that are subject to the General Indemnification Limit,
shall in no event exceed US$34,000,000. In no event shall Seller be required
to indemnify Buyer for Damages that, in aggregate, are in excess of an amount
equal to US$136,000,000 minus the Company Net Working Capital Shortfall,
except in the case of any matters listed in Section 12.2(a)(ix), for which
Seller shall be liable for the full amount of any Damages resulting therefrom
without limitation.

 



 

(c) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall first seek recovery of Damages
from the Escrow Cash. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
amounts that a Buyer Indemnified Person recovers from the Escrow Cash pursuant
to Fundamental Matters or the Seller IP Rep shall not reduce the amount that a
Buyer Indemnified Person may recover with respect to claims that are not
Fundamental Matters or the Seller IP Rep. By way of illustration, assuming
there are no other claims for indemnification, in the event that Damages
resulting from a Fundamental Matter are first satisfied from the Escrow Cash
and such recovery fully depletes the Escrow Cash, the maximum amount
recoverable by a Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to a subsequent claim that
is not a Fundamental Matter shall continue to be the full dollar value of the
Escrow Cash irrespective of the fact that the Escrow Cash was used to satisfy
such Fundamental Matter (such that the total amount recoverable for such two
claims would be the same regardless of the chronological order in which they
were made).

 



 

(d) Damages shall be calculated net of actual recoveries under existing
insurance policies (in each case calculated, to the extent reasonably
feasible, net of any actual collection costs, deductibles, co-payments,
premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums); ___provided, that,_
no Indemnified Person shall be obligated to seek recovery under any insurance
policies with respect to any particular Damages.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the rights and
remedies of the Indemnified Persons after the Closing shall not be limited by
(A) any investigation made, disclosure received, or knowledge obtained, by or
on behalf of any Indemnified Person prior to the Closing regarding any
failure, breach or other event or circumstance ( _provided_ that Buyer
acknowledges that the representations and warranties in _Article 3_ shall be
read together with the disclosures in the Seller Disclosure Letter to together
constitute the representations and warranties of Seller hereunder (subject to
any disclaimers in the Seller Disclosure Letter that a particular disclosure
is given for informational purposes only without affecting the rights and
remedies of the Indemnified Persons under this _Article 12_ )) or (B) any
waiver of any condition to the Closing related thereto and (ii) if an
Indemnified Person's claim under this _Article 12_ may be properly
characterized in multiple ways in accordance with this _Article 12_ such that
such claim may or may not be subject to different limitations depending on
such characterization, then such Indemnified Person shall have the right to
characterize such claim in a manner that maximizes the recovery and time to
assert such claim permitted in accordance with this _Article 12_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller
shall not be liable for any Damages relating to any matter to the extent that
such matter has been included as a downward adjustment in the calculation of
the Share Purchase Consideration.

 



 

(g) Following the Closing, this _Article 12_ shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy for recovery of monetary Damages by the Indemnified Persons
for all Indemnifiable Matters (it being understood that nothing in this
_Section_ _12.3(f)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the parties'
rights (x) to an injunction or specific performance or other equitable relief
to enforce the parties' obligations under this Agreement or (y) in the case of
fraud).

 



 

12.4. _Notice of Claim_.

 



 

(a) An "Indemnified Person" means a Buyer Indemnified Person or a Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, seeking indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 12_. An "Indemnifying Person" means any party providing
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 12_.

 



 

(b) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification by
any Indemnified Person for Damages under this _Article 12_. An Indemnified
Person may give notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own
Damages or for Damages incurred by any other Indemnified Person, and an
Indemnified Person shall promptly give written notice of such Claim executed
by an officer of such Indemnified Person (a "Notice of Claim") to the
Indemnifying Person after the Indemnified Person becomes aware of the
existence of any actual claim or circumstance that could reasonably give rise
to a potential claim by an Indemnified Person for indemnification from the
Indemnifying Person under this _Article 12_ , arising out of or resulting from
(i) any Indemnifiable Matter listed in _Section_ _12.2_ or (ii) the assertion,
whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnified Person of a claim,
demand or Action brought by a third party against such Indemnified Person (in
each such case, a "Third-Party Claim") that is based on, arises out of or
relates to a circumstance such Indemnified Person reasonably believes could be
any Indemnifiable Matter.

 



 

(c) The period during which claims may be initiated (the "Claims Period")
for indemnification for Damages arising out of or resulting from the
Indemnifiable Matters (other than the Fundamental Matters) shall commence at
the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the 9 month
anniversary of the Closing Date. The Claims Period for indemnification for
Damages arising out of or resulting from Fundamental Matters shall commence at
the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the date of expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnified Person given pursuant to this
_Section_ _12.4_ shall contain the following information:

 



 

(i) a good faith, non-binding preliminary estimate of the aggregate amount
of Damages that have arisen or are expected to arise from such Claim; and

 



 

(ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to the Indemnified Person), of the facts, circumstances or events
giving rise to such Damages based on the Indemnified Person's good faith
belief thereof, including (x) the basis for such anticipated liability and the
nature of the breach to which such Damages are related, (y) the identity of
any third party claimant and (z) copies of any formal demand or complaint from
any third party claimant.

 



 

Such Notice of Claim (x) need only specify such information to the knowledge
of such officer of the Indemnified Person as of the date thereof, (y) shall
not limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect
to the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such
Notice of Claim and (z) may be updated and amended from time to time by an
Indemnified Person by delivering an updated or amended Notice of Claim, so
long as the delivery of the original Notice of Claim is made within the
applicable Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to the
underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such original
Notice of Claim; __provided__ , that all claims for Damages properly set forth
in a Notice of Claim or any update or amendment thereto shall remain
outstanding until such claims have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding
the expiration of such Claims Period.

 



 

(e) No delay or failure on the part of an Indemnified Person in giving the
Indemnifying Person a Notice of Claim shall relieve the Indemnifying Person
from any of its obligations under this _Article 12_ unless (and then only to
the extent that) the Indemnifying Person is materially prejudiced thereby in
terms of the amount of Damages the Indemnifying Person is obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Persons for.

 



 

12.5. _Defense of Third-Party Claims_. Any Third-Party Claim shall be
subject to the following procedures:

 



 

(a) _Defense by Indemnifying Person_. The Indemnifying Person will have
the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and
expense with reputable legal counsel of its choosing (provided that such
counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person) by delivering
written notice of such election, accompanied by a written acknowledgement of
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person with respect thereto up to
applicable liability limit of the Indemnifying Person therefor under _Section_
_12.3(b)_ , to the Indemnified Person within 15 Business Days after receipt of
the Notice of Claim describing such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Person
may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third-Party Claim
prior to the time that it receives notice from Indemnitor as contemplated by
the preceding sentence. If Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of the
Third-Party Claim in accordance with this subsection (a), then:

 



 

(i) The Indemnifying Person shall keep the Indemnified Person informed of
all material developments relating to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified
Person shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent that
receipt of such documents does not waive any privilege.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) The Indemnified Person may retain separate co-counsel and participate
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with
respect to such Third-Party Claim at its own cost and expense, unless the
Indemnified Person shall reasonably determine that there is a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Person, on the one hand, and the Indemnified
Persons, on the other hand, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel will be indemnified subject to the applicable liability limit of
the Indemnifying Person therefor under _Section_ _12.3(b)_ in the event the
Indemnified Persons does not elect to assume the defense itself pursuant to
_Section_ _12.5(b)(iv)_ , but such separate counsel shall not be entitled to
determine or conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim or settlement
negotiations with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(iii) The Indemnifying Person shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (1) such
judgment, settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release from all
liability with respect to the claim in favor of the Indemnified Person and
does not involve any finding or admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Person, (2) the sole relief provided in connection with such judgment,
settlement or compromise is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Person concurrently with the effectiveness thereof or any other
relief that is enforceable only against Indemnifying Person and (3) the
Indemnifying Person shall not encumber the assets, properties or rights of any
Indemnified Person or agree to any restriction or condition that would
adversely affect any Indemnified Person.

 



 

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indemnifying Person
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim (unless
the Indemnified Person agrees otherwise in writing) in the event:

 



 

(i) the Indemnifying Person has not confirmed in writing to the
Indemnified Person that the Indemnifying Person will indemnify the Indemnified
Person up to applicable liability limit of the Indemnifying Person therefor
under _Section_ _12.3(b)_ from and against any Damages based upon, resulting
from, relating to or arising out of the Third-Party Claim;

 



 

(ii) the Third-Party Claim involves (x) an injunction or other equitable
relief or criminal allegations or (y) Intellectual Property matters;

 



 

(iii) Damages sought under such Third-Party Claim (together with Damages
sought under any other Claims then pending or in dispute) would reasonably be
expected to exceed the applicable liability limit of the Indemnifying Person
therefor under _Section_ _12.3(b)_ ; or

 



 

(iv) legal counsel to the Indemnified Person reasonably determines that
the Indemnifying Person has a conflict of interest in representing the
interests of the Indemnified Person (including because the Indemnified Person
may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the
Indemnifying Person in respect of a Third-Party Claim).

 



 

(c) _Defense by Indemnified Person_. In the event that the Indemnifying
Person declines to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim or is not
entitled to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim according to
subsection (b) above, then the Indemnified Person will have the right to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choosing,
provided that such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying
Person. If the Indemnified Person assumes the defense of the Third-Party Claim
in accordance with this subsection (c), then:

 



 



 

 



   



 

(i) The Indemnified Person shall keep Indemnifying Person informed of all
material developments relating to such Third-Party Claim. Indemnifying Person
shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent that
receipt of such documents does not waive any privilege.

 



 

(ii) Indemnifying Person may retain separate co-counsel and participate in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect
to such Third-Party Claim at its own cost and expense, but shall not be
entitled to determine or conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim or
settlement negotiations with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(iii) The Indemnified Person shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of Indemnifying Person (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (1) such
judgment, settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release from all
liability with respect to the claim in favor of the Indemnified Person and
does not involve any finding or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnifying
Person, and (2) the Indemnified Person stipulates in writing that there are no
Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification under this _Article 12_ in
connection with such judgment, settlement or compromise.

 



 

(d) _Cooperation_. The Indemnifying Person, Company and the Indemnified
Person shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the defense
of any Third-Party Claim, including by (i) furnishing copies of documents,
records or other information reasonably requested by the other party and (ii)
providing access to employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is
reasonably necessary to assist in the evaluation and defense of such Third-
Party Claim (provided that any such access shall not unreasonably interfere
with the business activities of either party or violate attorney-client
privilege).

 



 

12.6. _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given by an
Indemnified Person shall be resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) _Uncontested Claims_. If, within 30 days after a Notice of Claim is
received by Indemnifying Person, Indemnifying Person does not contest such
Notice of Claim in writing to Indemnified Person as provided in _Section_
_12.6(b)_ , Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed to have
consented, on behalf of Indemnifying Person, to the recovery by the
Indemnified Person of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of
Claim in accordance with this _Article 12_.

 



 

(b) _Contested Claims_. If Indemnifying Person gives Indemnified Person
written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a
"Contested Claim"), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis
for such objections, within the 30 day period specified in _Section_ _12.6(a)_
, then the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall attempt in
good faith for 30 days from the notice of a Contested Claim to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to such Contested Claim. If the
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person are able to resolve such
Contested Claim, then Indemnified Person and Indemnifying Person shall enter
into a written settlement agreement with respect to the resolution of the
Contested Claim. If the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person are
unable to resolve such Contested Claim, then either the Indemnifying Person or
the Indemnified Person may bring suit with regards to the Contested Claim in
accordance with the terms and provisions of _Section_ _13.2_.

 



 

(c) _Payment of Damages_. The payment of any Claim pursuant to this
_Article 12_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Indemnified Persons, within five Business Days
after the resolution of a Notice of Claim in accordance with the terms of this
_Section_ _12.6_.

 



 



 

 



   



 

12.7. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Indemnifying Person and
Indemnified Person agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to treat) any
payment received pursuant to this _Article 12_ as adjustments to the Share
Purchase Consideration for all tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted
by Applicable Law.

 



 

12.8. _Other Indemnification Matters_. Seller covenants and agrees to not
seek indemnification, contribution or reimbursement from the Company or Buyer
for or by reason of, any matter arising out of or relating solely to the
operation of the Company Business prior to the Closing Date including pursuant
to any intercompany arrangements providing for indemnification, contribution
or reimbursement in favor of Seller from the Company as an Affiliate of Seller
in existence on the Closing Date (but for clarity, the foregoing shall not
limit Seller's or the Company's rights against each other pursuant to the
terms of the Intercompany Contracts between them that are, in each case,
listed on _Schedule_ _3.28(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter and will not
terminate as of the Closing Date).

 



 

ARTICLE 13

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

13.1. _Governing Law_. The internal laws of the State of Delaware,
irrespective of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern the validity of
this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto.

 



 

13.2. _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim (each, a "Dispute") arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or the interpretation, breach, termination,
validity or invalidity thereof, shall be exclusively settled by arbitration in
Hong Kong under the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre Administered
Arbitration Rules ("HKIAC Rules") in force when the Notice of Arbitration is
submitted in accordance with the HKIAC Rules, save for as provided by sub-
section (g).

 



 

(b) There shall be three (3) arbitrators. The claimant(s), irrespective of
number, shall jointly appoint one (1) arbitrator, the respondent(s),
irrespective of number, shall jointly appoint one (1) arbitrator, and the two
(2) arbitrators shall jointly appoint the third arbitrator; if the first two
arbitrators are unable to agree upon a third arbitrator within 30 days after
the first two arbitrators are appointed, the third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the Hong Kong Mediation Council of the Hong Kong International
Arbitration Centre.

 



 

(c) The arbitral proceedings shall be confidential and be conducted in
English. To the extent that the HKIAC Rules are in conflict with the
provisions of this _Section_ _13.2_ , including the provisions concerning the
appointment of the arbitrators, the provisions of this _Section_ _13.2_ shall
prevail.

 



 

(d) In addition to the authority conferred upon the arbitral tribunal by
the HKIAC Rules, the arbitral tribunal shall have the authority to order
production of documents in accordance with the International Bar Association
Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration published by
International Bar Association as current on the commencement of the
arbitration.

 



 

(e) The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the
parties thereto, and the prevailing party may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for enforcement of such award. The Convention on the Recognition
and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards shall apply to the enforcement of
any arbitral award.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(f) The arbitral tribunal shall decide any Dispute submitted by the
parties to the arbitration strictly in accordance with the substantive laws of
the State of Delaware (without regard to principles of conflict of laws
thereunder) and shall not apply any other substantive law. The award shall be
in writing and contain written findings of facts and conclusions of law.

 



 

(g) Any party to the Dispute shall be entitled to seek preliminary
injunctive relief, if in its judgment such action is necessary to avoid
irreparable harm of damages, from any court with competent jurisdiction over
the other party pending the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. Despite of
such action, the Parties will continue to participate in good faith in the
arbitration procedures specified in this Agreement.

 



 

During the course of the arbitral tribunal's adjudication of the Dispute, this
Agreement shall continue to be performed except with respect to the part in
dispute and under adjudication.

 



 

13.3. _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_that_ , without such consent, Buyer may transfer or assign, in whole or in
part or from time to time, its rights and/or obligations hereunder to (i) one
or more of its Affiliates, (ii) any lender providing financing (or any agent
or collateral trustee for such lender) (including pursuant to the terms
thereof to the extent necessary for the purposes of creating a security
interest herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement and its rights hereunder
as collateral in respect of such financing) or (iii) following the Closing,
any successor in interest to a purchaser of all or substantially all of the
assets or equities of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such transfer or
assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder; _provided_ ,
_further_ that without the consent of Buyer, Seller may transfer or assign, in
whole, its rights and obligations hereunder to any successor in interest or a
purchaser of Seller by way of acquisition of shares, merger, consolidation or
the purchase of all or substantially all of the assets or equity of Seller,
provided such purchaser or successor in interest and its ultimate parent
entity unconditionally and expressly assume in writing Seller's obligations
hereunder in their entirety. Any assignment in violation of this provision
shall be void.

 



 

13.4. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable
provision.

 



 

13.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile, .PDF, e-mail or other electronic
transmission, each of which shall be an original as regards any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures
of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.

 



 

13.6. _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby or by law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court
of the United States or any state having jurisdiction.

 



 



 

 



   



 

13.7. _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement
may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a writing signed by Buyer and
Seller, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either
generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby;
_provided, however_ , that the any term or provision of Article 14 may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by a writing signed by Seller and each
Guarantor. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the
performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. At any time prior to the Closing,
each of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to it contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit contained herein. No
such waiver or extension shall be effective unless signed in writing by the
party against whom such waiver or extension is asserted. The failure of any
party to enforce any of the provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a
waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such provisions.

 



 

13.8. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Share Purchase is consummated, all
transaction expenses shall be paid by the party incurring such expense,
_provided_ that if the Share Purchase is consummated all transaction expenses
of any Group Company that are not already the responsibility of Seller shall
be paid by Seller at the Closing (such transaction expenses of any Group
Company not paid by Seller at the Closing, "Unpaid Transaction Expenses").

 



 

13.9. _Attorneys ' Fees_. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret
any part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover,
as an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys'
fees to be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any
appeal). The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit,
regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.

 



 

13.10. _Notices_. All notices and other communications required or
permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand
delivered in person, sent by facsimile, sent by certified or registered first-
class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier
service. In addition, each party shall send an email copy of such notice at
the email addresses set forth below but such email shall not constitute notice

13.11. _Interpretation; Rules of Construction_. When a reference is made
in this Agreement to Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include",
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation". The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
they have been represented by legal counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 



 

13.12. _No Joint Venture_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of
the parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an
agent, employee or legal representative of any other party. No party shall
have the power to control the activities and operations of any other and their
status is, and at all times shall continue to be, that of independent
contractors with respect to each other. No party shall have any power or
authority to bind or commit any other party. No party shall hold itself out as
having any authority or relationship in contravention of this _Section _
_13.12_.

 



 

13.13. _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of the other
party, each party will on or after the Closing cooperate with the other
parties and execute and deliver such further instruments, documents and
agreements and to give such further written assurances as may be reasonably
required by any other party to evidence and reflect the transactions described
herein and contemplated hereby and to carry into effect the intents and
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

13.14. _Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. No provisions of this Agreement
are intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third party
beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer,
employee, consultant, contractor, Affiliate, equity holder or partner of any
party hereto or any other Person unless specifically provided otherwise in
this _Section 13.14_ and, except as so provided, all provisions hereof shall
be personal solely between the parties to this Agreement; for clarity,
_Article 12_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified Persons, who shall be
considered third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement with full rights of
enforcement as though each such Indemnified Person was a signatory to this
Agreement.

 



 

13.15. _Public Announcement_. Buyer, Seller and the Company and their
respective Affiliates shall not issue any press release or make any public
statement or make any filings with any Governmental Authority regarding the
Share Purchase or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
consent of the other parties hereto and first consulting with the other
parties hereto (including by providing the other parties hereto the
opportunity to review and comment thereon).

 



 



 

 



   



 

13.16. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Seller and Buyer, or an Affiliate of such party, each confirm that
they have entered into the non-disclosure agreement (the "NDA") and that they
are each bound by, and shall abide by, the provisions of the NDA. If this
Agreement is terminated, the NDA shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, and all copies of documents containing confidential
information of a disclosing party shall be returned by the receiving party to
the disclosing party or be destroyed, as provided in the NDA. The existence
and terms of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the documents and
instruments contemplated hereby and thereby, and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, shall constitute "Evaluation Material" under the NDA;
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer and Seller each agree that Seller shall be
authorized and intends to file this Agreement (in its entirety except the
Seller Disclosure Letter) on a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission promptly following execution
of this Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller shall be authorized and intends
to distribute a press release announcing the execution of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby promptly following execution of this
Agreement. Each of Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to consult
and discuss in good faith with the other party the form and content of such
press release prior to its release and consider in good faith any reasonable
changes that are suggested by the other party prior to releasing or making
such press release.

 



 

(b) For a period of three years after the Closing, Seller agrees to, and
shall cause its Affiliates and their Representatives to: (i) treat and hold as
confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any Person to) any and all
confidential and proprietary information solely relating to the Company
Business (including any trade secrets, processes, "know-how", patent
applications, product development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing
and marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of client and consultant
contracts, operations methods, product development techniques or plans,
designs and design projects, business acquisition plans, new personnel
acquisition plans inventions and research projects, in each case relating
solely to the Company Business), (ii) in the event that Seller or any such
Affiliate or Representative is requested or required, in connection with any
proceeding by or before a Governmental Authority, securities exchange or other
self-regulatory authority to disclose any such information, Seller will
provide Buyer with prompt written notice of such requirement so that Buyer may
seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this _Section
_ _13.16(b)_ , (iii) in the event that such protective order or other remedy
is not obtained, or Buyer waives compliance with this _Section _ _13.16(b)_ ,
furnish only that portion of such confidential information which is legally
required to be provided and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information; _provided, however_ , that this sentence shall not apply to any
information that (A) at the time of disclosure, is available publicly and was
not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by Seller or its Affiliates or their
Representatives or (B) is or becomes rightfully known to Seller, its
Affiliates or their Representatives after Closing, without restriction, from a
source (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) not known to Seller or any such
Affiliate or Representative to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with,
or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to, Buyer or its
Affiliates that prohibits such disclosure.

 



 

(c) For a period of three years after the Closing, Seller shall and shall
cause its Affiliates and Representatives to undertake reasonable precautions
to safeguard and protect all confidential or proprietary information with
respect to the Company Business that they have retained, in accordance with
the policies and procedures that are applicable to their own confidential
information.

 



 



 

 



   



 

13.17. _Conflicts; Attorney Client Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Solely as between Buyer and Seller (and not any third party), Buyer
waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause each Group Company to waive
and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of
Seller or any officer, director or employee of a Group Company (any such
Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or any
other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, by any legal counsel
currently representing any Group Company in connection with this Agreement or
any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby (the "Current
Representation").

 



 

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause each Group
Company to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect
to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated Person
occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer, and
following the Closing, with any Group Company related to this Agreement, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such
attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall
be retained by Seller; _provided_ that the foregoing waiver and
acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
thereby, or to communications with any Person other than the Designated
Persons.

 



 

13.18. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, the Ancillary Agreements and the Common Interest Agreement, constitute
the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
agreements or understandings, inducements or conditions, express or implied,
written or oral, between the parties with respect hereto other than the NDA.
The express terms hereof control and supersede any course of performance or
usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof. 

 



 

13.19. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_ (a) . EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR

ARTICLE 14

 

GUARANTEE

 



 

14.1. _Guarantee_. To induce Seller to enter into this Agreement,
Guarantors, each intending to be legally bound, each (on a joint and several
basis) hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller
the full, due and punctual payment as and when due of the payment obligations
of Buyer under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including any
obligations of Buyer to pay damages for breach of any obligations under this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreements (the "Obligations"). If Buyer fails to
pay or perform the Obligations when due, then Guarantors' liabilities to
Seller pursuant to this _Article 14_ in respect of such Obligations shall, at
Seller's option, become immediately due and payable and Seller may at any time
and from time to time, at Seller's option, take any and all actions available
hereunder or under Applicable Law against either or both of Guarantors to
collect or perform the Obligations. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all payments to be provided under this _Article 14_ shall be made
in immediately available funds. Each Guarantor promises and undertakes, on a
joint and several basis, to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any
deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of any kind. In furtherance
of the foregoing, each Guarantor acknowledges that Seller may, in its sole
discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or actions against each or
both Guarantors for the full amount or performance of the Obligations,
regardless of whether any action is brought against Buyer. Each Guarantor
agrees, on a joint and several basis, to pay on demand all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) incurred by Seller in connection with enforcement of its rights
hereunder.

 



 



 

 



   



 

14.2. _Change in Obligations, Certain Waivers_. Each Guarantor agrees
that Seller may, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time,
without notice to or further consent of Guarantors, extend the time of payment
of the Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Buyer for the
extension or renewal thereof, in whole or in part, without in any way
impairing or affecting Guarantors' obligations under this _Article 14_ or
affecting the validity or enforceability of this _Article 14_. Each Guarantor
agrees that the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be released
or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the failure
or delay on the part of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy against Buyer; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of
payment of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms of _Section_
_13.7_ ; (c) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
Buyer; (d) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Buyer; (e) the adequacy of any other means Seller may
have of obtaining payment related to the Obligations; (f) the existence of any
claim, set-off or other right which either or both Guarantors may have at any
time against Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, whether in
connection with the Obligations or otherwise except as provided herein and
except for claims, set-offs or other rights that may be asserted by Buyer; or
(g) any discharge of either or both of Guarantors as a matter of Applicable
Law or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor (other than as a result of, and
to the extent of, full payment and performance of the Obligations in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement). To the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights
or defenses arising by reason of any Applicable Law which would otherwise
require any election of remedies by Seller. Each Guarantor waives promptness,
diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Guarantee and of the Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of the Obligations incurred and all other notices of any
kind (other than notices expressly required to be provided to Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Buyer or any other
Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all
suretyship defenses generally. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guarantors
do not waive, and may assert, defenses to the performance or payment of the
Obligations (x) that are available to Buyer under this Agreement, (y) in
respect of a breach by Seller of this _Article 14_ or (z) in respect of fraud
of Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that neither Guarantor
may assert defenses that Buyer possess relating to (i) lack of validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement against
Buyer arising from Buyer's defective incorporation or lack of qualification to
do business in any applicable jurisdiction, (ii) Buyer's lack of corporate
authority to enter into or perform this Agreement or any other Ancillary
Agreement or the due execution and delivery thereof, or (iii) the termination
of existence, dissolution, liquidation, insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership,
or other reorganization of Buyer, as applicable). Each Guarantor acknowledges
that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set forth in
this _Article 14_ are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
Subject to Seller's rights expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller
hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or bring any other
claim arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby, against any of the Affiliates of Buyer other than each
Guarantor or Buyer or their respective successors and assigns under this
Agreement (such Affiliates of Buyer other than each Guarantor or Buyer or
their respective successors and assigns under this Agreement, collectively,
each a "Non-Recourse Party").

 



 



 

 



   



 

14.3. _No Waiver; Cumulative Rights_. No failure on the part of Seller to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by
Seller of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future
exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Seller shall not have any
obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or
all of Seller's rights against, Buyer or any other Person liable for the
Obligations prior to proceeding against either or both Guarantors.

 



 

14.4. _Representations and Warranties of Guarantors_ _._ Each Guarantor
hereby, separately and not jointly, represents and warrants:

 



 

(a) the Guarantor is duly incorporated or organized, as applicable,
validly existing and in good standing under the Applicable Laws of its
jurisdiction or incorporation or organization, as applicable;

 



 

(b) the Guarantor is duly licensed or qualified in each jurisdiction in
which the ownership or operation of its assets or the character of its
activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not be material to
Guarantor's ability to perform its obligations under this Article 14.

 



 

(c) the execution, delivery and performance of this _Article 14_ have been
duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of
such Guarantor's charter, partnership agreement, operating agreement or
similar organizational documents or any Applicable Law, except where such
conflict would not be material to Guarantor's ability to perform its
obligations under this _Article 14_ ;

 



 

(d) other than any consent, approval, Order or authorization of, filing or
registration with, or notification to any Governmental Authority contemplated
by this Agreement as being necessary for the entry into and consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereunder, all consents, approvals,
authorizations, permits of, filings with and notifications to, any
Governmental Authority necessary for the due execution, delivery and
performance of this _Article 14_ by Guarantor have been obtained or made and
all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this _Article 14_ ),
except for any of the foregoing, if any, if not made or obtained by Guarantor
would not be material to Guarantor's ability to perform its obligations under
this _Article 14_ ;

 



 

(e) this _Article 14_ constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law); and

 



 

(f) the Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform when due
its obligations under this _Article 14_

 



 

14.5. _Continuing Guarantee_. Subject to Section 14.2 and notwithstanding
anything to contrary in this Agreement (other than Section 14.2), this
Guarantee (Article 14) may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in
full force and effect, and shall continue to be binding on each Guarantor and
its successors or assigns until the Obligations have been paid and performed
in full.

 



 

14.6. _No Recourse_. Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall confer or
give or shall be construed to confer or give to any Person (including any
Person acting in a representative capacity) any rights or remedies against any
Person other than the Guarantors as expressly set forth herein.
Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement or
any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith, and
notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantors may be a partnership or limited
liability company, Seller acknowledges and agrees that no Person other than
each of the Guarantors has any obligation under this Article 14 and that no
recourse shall be had under this Article 14, or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, such obligation or their creation, against, and
no personal liability shall attach to, any Non-Recourse Party, through Buyer
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim by or on behalf of Seller against any Non-Recourse
Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any Applicable Law or otherwise. Subject to Seller's
rights expressly set forth in the Agreement, recourse against the Guarantors
pursuant to this Article 14 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller
and all of its Affiliates against the Guarantors in respect of any liabilities
or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

 



 



 

 



   



 

14.7. _Nature of Guarantee_ (a). Seller shall not be obligated to file
any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that Buyer becomes subject
to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of
Seller to so file shall not affect either or both Guarantor's obligations
hereunder. In the event that any payment to Seller in respect of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason
whatsoever, each of the Guarantors shall remain liable under this Article 14
with respect to such Obligations as if such payment had not been made.
