Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer
("Merger Sub"), WRH, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, solely
in its capacity as the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to Section 10.15
hereof, American Capital Equity III, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Stockholders' Representative"). Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and the

General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Company with the Company surviving such merger (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Buyer and Merger Sub have
unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Buyer and
Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Buyer, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved and
adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to action taken by unanimous written consent in accordance

Sub;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (a) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for the Company to

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements in connection with the foregoing and also

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, each Party hereby
agrees:





ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and as a
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer or, to the extent
permitted by Section 10.4, its Affiliates.

Section 1.2 Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall
prepare a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"). Upon the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties shall file the
Certificate of Merger, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date. As soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date, the Parties shall make any and all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL to give effect to the Merger. The Merger will be
effective at such time as the Parties duly file the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date or time
as Buyer and the Company agree in writing and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject hereto, at the Effective Time,
all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all claims,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities, liabilities, debts and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub will become the claims, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the
Company, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended
by virtue of the Merger to be in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case until duly amended as
provided therein or by applicable laws.

Section 1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger Sub
serving in those positions immediately prior to the Effective Time will become
the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, and will remain the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation
after the Merger, in each case until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal.

remains unpaid after the payments specified in Section 2.2(b)(i) are made, the
Paying Agent shall pay to each Series B Preferred Stockholder the Pro Rata
Amount of the aggregate Series B Liquidation Amounts with respect to the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such Series B Preferred
Stockholder;

agent agreement with such Paying Agent (which paying agent agreement will be
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer) for the purpose of
making the payments pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(i) through (vi). For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have no responsibility or liability for any
action or omission by the Paying Agent.

(d) It is expressly understood and agreed that Buyer's payment on the Closing
Date (i) of the Option Payments to the Company (for dispersal by the Company
through its payroll system) and (ii) of the Closing Date Payment Amount to the
Paying Agent, shall be in full satisfaction of Buyer's obligation with respect
to such amounts, subject to any Merger Consideration Adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.8, and, once paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no liability to the Stockholders'
Representative, any Equity Holder or any other Person for any amounts in
respect of the same.

of the following securities:

pursuant to this Agreement to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration
Adjustment, any amounts from the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the Indemnity Escrow
Fund or any portion of the Administrative Expense Amount, in each case, to the
extent applicable, each class, series and subclass of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding shares of
Company Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.4(b) and any Dissenting
Shares, will be canceled and convert automatically into the right to receive
an amount in cash as set forth in Section 2.2(b) payable, without interest, to
the applicable Stockholder upon the surrender pursuant to Section 2.6 of the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Stock.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company and any shares of Company
Stock owned by Buyer, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Buyer will be
canceled automatically without conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution will be made with respect thereto. 

(c) Equity Interests of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.5 Termination of Options and SAR Units. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall, subject to and conditioned upon the Closing, take all
necessary action, which action will be effective as of the Effective Time, to:

(a) terminate the Stock Option Plans and all Option Agreements;

(b) terminate the SAR Plan and all SAR Unit agreements

(c) cancel each Option and SAR Unit, in each case, whether vested or unvested;
and

(d) to the extent the exercise price for a share of Common Stock under a
vested Option (including those Options which vest in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) ("Vested Options") is less than
the Per Share Amount (such Vested Options, the "In-the-Money Options"), make a
cash payment through the Company's payroll system to each In-the-Money Option
Holder of In-the-Money Options in an amount equal to (A) the excess of (x) the
Per Share Amount, over (y) the exercise price for a share of Common Stock
under such In-the-Money Option, multiplied by (B) the total number of shares
of Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Option (an "Option Payment") less
applicable Tax withholding.

Section 2.6 Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Payment Procedures. The Company shall mail, or shall cause its designee to
mail, to each Person that is a holder of record of Company Stock entitled to
receive the amounts set forth in Section 2.2(b): (i) a letter of transmittal
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative (provided
that such letter of transmittal shall contain customary covenants and shall
not include any representations or warranties on the part of such Person other
than with respect to ownership of and title to such Person's Company Stock,
power and authority of such Person to execute and deliver the letter of
transmittal, the letter of transmittal constituting a valid and binding
obligation of such Person, and receipt and acknowledgment of this Agreement
and the opportunity to ask questions about this Agreement) (the "Letter of
Transmittal"), which shall specify that (A) the Stockholders' Representative
is designated to serve in the capacity set forth in Section 10.15, and (B)
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
evidencing such shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") will pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates and the Letter of Transmittal to the
Paying Agent, with a copy delivered to Buyer, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the portion of the
Closing Date Payment Amount to be paid to such holder of record of Company
Stock by the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 2.2(b). Upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation and a copy thereof being
delivered to Buyer, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder
of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount to be paid in respect of each share of Company Stock formerly evidenced
by such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), and such Certificate
shall then be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.6, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, if
any, to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this
Article II.

(b) No Further Rights. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the securities represented by such Certificates and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as Stockholders of the
Company, except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. 

(c) Withholding Rights. Each of the Stockholders' Representative, the
Surviving Corporation, Buyer, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent are
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement (including any amounts paid from the Adjustment
Escrow Fund, the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Administrative Expense Account)
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment under all applicable Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Stockholders' Representative, the Surviving Corporation or Buyer, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Equity Holders in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

(d) Lost Certificates. If a Stockholder's Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Stockholder may submit in lieu thereof, an affidavit of loss or
destruction.

Section 2.7 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, any Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the right to
receive the amount of cash as provided in Section 2.2(b) or any other amounts
contemplated by this Agreement, if any, but shall instead be converted into
the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to any such Dissenting Share pursuant to the DGCL. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment
thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with
the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to the DGCL). If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Share shall lose its status as a Dissenting Share, then any such
share shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the amount of
cash as provided in Section 2.2(b) and any other amounts contemplated by this
Agreement, if any, as if such share never had been a Dissenting Share, and
Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably
practicable after) the applicable time specified in Section 2.6 following the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 2.6, the amount
of cash as provided in Section 2.2(b) as if such share had never been a
Dissenting Share. The Company shall give Buyer (a) prompt written notice of
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company and (b) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Buyer, voluntarily make any payment or offer
to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim
or demand with respect to any Dissenting Share. The Company and the
Stockholders' Representative shall (or shall cause their Affiliates to)
enforce any contractual waivers that the Equity Holders have granted regarding
appraisal rights that would apply to the Merger.

Section 2.8 Adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

(a) The Merger Consideration shall be increased or reduced as set forth in
Section 2.8(f) hereof. Any increase or decrease in the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be referred to as a "Merger Consideration
Adjustment".

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Stockholders' Representative a statement (the "Preliminary
Closing Statement"), which sets forth Buyer's calculation of (i) the Net
Working Capital (the "Closing Net Working Capital") and the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount based thereon, (ii) the Cash and Cash Equivalents
(the "Closing Cash"), (iii) the Indebtedness of the Group Companies (the
"Closing Indebtedness"), (iv) the Company Transaction Expenses (the "Closing
Company Transaction Expenses"), (v) the Audit Support Amount (the "Closing
Audit Support Amount") and (vi) the amount of the Merger Consideration based
thereon, in each case prepared (x) as of immediately preceding the Closing and
(y) in accordance with the accounting principles, policies, procedures,
practices, judgments, applications and methodologies used in preparing the
Financial Statements, along with reasonable supporting detail to evidence the
Buyer's calculations of such amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, the
accounting principles, policies, procedures, practices, judgments,
applications and methodologies used in preparing the Financial Statements
shall be the only accounting principles, policies, procedures, practices,
judgments, applications or methodologies used or relied upon in the
preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement, the calculation of each of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Company Transaction Expenses, and the Closing Audit Support Amount and no
other accounting principles, policies, procedures, practices, judgments,
applications or methodologies shall be introduced by any party hereto or the
Accounting Firm. 

(c) The Stockholders' Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days

Buyer's business, and (ii) provide to the Stockholders' Representative and its
accountants reasonable access during reasonable hours, upon reasonable prior
notice, under reasonable circumstances and without unduly interfering with

writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, and (B) all matters in dispute are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm. During the thirty (30) days following Buyer's
receipt of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and the Stockholders'
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement,
and upon such resolution, the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the agreement of Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative.

(d) If Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative are unable to resolve the
disputed items set forth in the Notice of Disagreement within forty-five (45)
days following Buyer's receipt of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer
period as Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative may mutually agree in
writing), following notice of such dispute, such dispute shall be submitted
to, and such dispute shall be resolved by, (i) Deloitte and Touche LLP, or (ii)
in the event such accounting firm is unable or unwilling to take such
assignment, a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by
Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative or, if Buyer and the Stockholders'
Representative cannot agree on an accounting firm within thirty (30) days
after timely delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, each of Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative shall select a nationally recognized accounting
firm and such two accounting firms shall designate a third nationally
recognized accounting firm that neither presently is, nor in the past three
(3) years has been, engaged by either Party or any of their respective
Affiliates. Deloitte and Touche LLP, the accounting firm so agreed to by Buyer
and the Stockholders' Representative, or the third accounting firm so selected
by the two accounting firms, is hereinafter referred to as the "Accounting
Firm". Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall submit to the
Accounting Firm for review and resolution all matters (but only such matters)
that are set forth in the Notice of Disagreement which remain in dispute.
Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm

disputes to make a final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Expenses,
Closing Audit Support Amount and the amount of the Merger Consideration based
thereon, in each case, calculated with reference to the items that are in
dispute as set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm that, in
resolving the items in the Notice of Disagreement that are still in dispute
and in determining the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Company Transaction Expenses, and Closing Audit Support
Amount, in each case, the Accounting Firm shall (i) not assign to any item in
dispute a value that is (A) greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Stockholders' Representative, on
the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest value for such item assigned by
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Stockholders' Representative, on the other
hand, (ii) make its determination based on an independent review (which will
be in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement) and, at the Accounting Firm's discretion, a one-day conference
concerning the dispute, at which conference each of Buyer and the
Stockholders' Representative shall have the right to present their respective
positions with respect to the dispute and have present their respective
advisors, counsel and accountants, (iii) render a final resolution in writing
to Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative (which final resolution shall be
requested by Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative to be delivered not
more than thirty (30) days following submission of such disputed matters to
the Accounting Firm), which, absent manifest error, shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing 

Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Audit Support Amount and the amount of
the Merger Consideration based thereon, and (iv) provide a written report to
Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative, if requested by either of them,
which sets forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Firm's
final determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Equity Holders, on the other
hand, based upon the percentage by which the portion of the contested amount
not awarded to each of Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative bears to the
amount actually contested by such Party.

(e) The Preliminary Closing Statement (as adjusted by the agreement of the
Parties or at the direction of the Accounting Firm, as applicable) shall be

shown on the Final Closing Statement. For purposes of determining Covered
Taxes, (i) in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use
Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income, the definition of Covered Tax
shall be deemed to include the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross receipts, sales or use
Tax, the definition of Covered Tax shall be deemed to include the amount that
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing
Date. All determinations made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made
in accordance with the past practices of the Group Companies, if any, to the
extent those practices are supportable by reasonable interpretations of
applicable Law.

(b) Tax Indemnity Procedures; Tax Contests. Buyer agrees to give prompt notice
to Stockholders' Representative of any Tax Loss or the assertion of any claim,
or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder relating to Taxes of any Group Company and
to give Stockholders' Representative such information with respect thereto as
Stockholders' Representative may reasonably request. The Stockholders'
Representative may, on behalf of the Equity Holders and at their expense, (i)
participate in and (ii) with respect to any suits, actions or proceedings
(including Tax audits) ("Tax Contests") that relate solely to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, assume the defense of any such Tax Contest; provided that (A)
Stockholders' Representative's chosen counsel is reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, (B) Stockholders' Representative shall provide Buyer with copies of all
material correspondence, notice or other written materials received from any
Tax authority in connection with, and shall otherwise keep Buyer and its tax
advisers informed of the progress of, such Tax Contest, (C) the Stockholders'
Representative shall provide Buyer with a copy of any written submission to be
sent to a Tax authority in connection 

with such Tax Contest prior to the submission thereof and shall give good
faith consideration to any comments or suggested revisions that Buyer or its
advisers may have with respect thereto, and (D) Stockholders' Representative
shall not agree to any settlement with respect to any Tax Contest without
Buyer's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If
Stockholders' Representative elects to assume the defense of any such Tax
Contest, (x) Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by Stockholders' Representative and (y) Stockholders'
Representative shall not assert that the Tax Loss, or any portion thereof,
with respect to which Buyer seeks indemnification, if determined adversely, is
not subject to indemnification. If Buyer controls any Tax Contest relating in
whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Straddle Tax
Period), (A) Buyer shall provide Stockholders' Representative with copies of
all material correspondence, notice or other written materials received from
any Tax authority in connection with, and shall otherwise keep Stockholders'
Representative and its tax advisers informed of the progress of, such Tax
Contest, (B) Buyer shall provide Stockholders' Representative with a copy of
any written submission to be sent to a Tax authority in connection with such
Tax Contest prior to the submission thereof and shall give good faith
consideration to any comments or suggested revisions that Stockholders'
Representative or its advisers may have with respect thereto, and (C) Buyer
shall not settle any such Tax Contest or any other suit, action or proceeding
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Section 5.4 without the
consent of Stockholders' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
Buyer for any Tax Contest relating solely to Pre-Closing Tax Periods for which
Stockholders' Representative has not assumed the defense thereof shall
constitute additional Tax Loss for which Buyer may be indemnified. Whether or
not Stockholders' Representative chooses to defend or prosecute any claim, all
of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Any claim of any Buyer Indemnified Party under this Section 5.4 (Tax Matters)
may be made and enforced by Buyer on behalf of such Buyer Indemnified Party.
To the extent of any conflict between this Section 5.4(b) and Section 9.3,
this Section 5.4(b) shall be controlling with respect to any Tax matters.

(c) Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes. Buyer shall, at its own expense, prepare or
cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns of the Group Companies that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date. To the extent that any such Tax Return includes a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Buyer shall (A) provide the Stockholders' Representative with a copy
of each such draft Tax Return at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the
earlier of (x) the date such Tax Return is filed and (y) the due date for
filing such return (taking into account any extensions thereof) and (B)
promptly deliver such additional information regarding such Tax Return as may
reasonably be requested by the Stockholders' Representative. Buyer shall
reasonably and in good faith consider any revisions to such Tax Returns as are
requested by the Stockholders' Representative, provided that such revisions
are requested no more than seven (7) days after such Tax Return is delivered
to the Stockholders' Representative. If Buyer and the Stockholders'
Representative are unable through good faith negotiations to resolve any
objection raised by the Stockholders' Representative with respect to any such
Tax Returns, the matter shall be referred to the Accounting Firm for
resolution in accordance with procedures substantially similar to those
described in Section 2.8(d); provided that if Buyer determined in good faith
that such resolution procedures would cause the Tax Returns not to be timely
filed, Buyer may, after good faith consideration of Stockholders'
Representative's suggested revisions, file such Tax Returns, and as soon as
practicable thereafter shall, if necessary, amend such Tax returns in
accordance with the abovementioned resolution procedures. Not later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes on any Tax
Return that includes a Pre-Closing Period, Buyer shall be entitled to receive
from the General Indemnity Escrow Fund the amount of Taxes, if any, for which
the Equity Holders are liable pursuant to Section 5.4(a).

(d) Remittance of Taxes. Subject to the indemnification obligations in Section
5.4(a), Buyer shall cause any amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns to
be timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity no later than the
date on which such Taxes are due.

(e) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable
Law or at the reasonable request of Buyer, the Equity Holders will, and will
cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation. 

(f) Refunds. Buyer shall pay over to the Stockholders' Representative (on
behalf of the Equity Holders) any Tax refunds (or credits in lieu of Tax
refunds) that (i) are received by Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries prior to the expiration of the Claims Period with
respect to indemnification claims under Section 5.4 and (ii) are attributable
to Taxes paid on or before the Closing Date by any Group Company with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not be required to pay over any Tax refunds (or credits in lieu of
Tax refunds) that are received by Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that are attributable to any carryback of any Tax item
(including a net operating loss or credit carryback) from any Post-Closing Tax
Period to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such payment shall be made within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of such refund (or the filing of any
Tax return on which there is allowed a credit in lieu of such refund). For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be required to make any payment
under this Section 5.4(f) in respect of the carryforward of any Tax asset from
any Pre-Closing Tax Period to any Post-Closing Tax Period.

(g) Cooperation; Preservation of Records. Buyer, the Group Companies and the
Stockholders' Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of
Tax returns, including the filing of any claim for a refund. After Closing,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) preserve and
keep the Tax records of the Group Companies for a period of seven (7) years
from the Closing, or for any longer periods as may be required by any
Governmental Entity or ongoing litigation, and (ii) make such records, and any
employees who assisted in the preparation of such records, available to the
Stockholders' Representative upon the reasonable request of the Stockholders'
Representative. If any Group Company wishes to destroy such records after the
time specified above, the Company shall first give sixty (60) days' prior
written notice to the Stockholders' Representative and the Stockholders'
Representative shall have the right at its respective option and expense, upon
providing written notice within that sixty (60)-day period, to take possession
of the records within ninety (90) days after the date of such Company's
provision of notice.

(h) French VDA Process. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall be entitled to
pursue a process (including voluntary disclosure to, and settlements with the
relevant Taxing authority, and/or the filing of Tax Returns and amended Tax
Returns with the relevant Taxing authority in connection therewith) that it in
good faith believes is appropriate to ensure that the Group Companies complied
with their Tax Return filing and Tax payment obligations in France with regard
to Imprime Fiscal Unique (IFU) whether such obligations relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, Straddle Tax Period or Post-Closing Tax Period (such
process, the "French VDA Process"). Promptly after submitting to a Taxing
authority any voluntary disclosure statement, Tax Return or amended Tax Return
pursuant to the French VDA Process that shows or will result in liability for
Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall provide the
Stockholders' Representative with a copy of such voluntary disclosure
statement, settlement agreement, Tax Return or amended Tax Return, as
applicable, and other relevant documents. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
Indemnified Parties' rights to be indemnified pursuant to Section 5.4(a) shall
include indemnification for Covered Taxes (including any reasonable expenses
incurred by Buyer in connection with the French VDA Process) incurred as a
result of the French VDA Process.

(i) Exclusivity. The indemnification provided for in this Section 5.4 shall be
the sole remedy for any claim in respect of Taxes, including any claim arising
out of or relating to a breach of any of the representations or warranties in
Section 3.13 (Taxes; Tax Returns).

Section 5.5 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the Company purchasing tail coverage described in Section
5.5(b), and except as prohibited by applicable Law, Buyer and Merger Sub agree
to cause the Surviving Corporation to ensure, and the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Closing agrees to ensure, that all rights to
indemnification now existing in favor of any individual who, at or prior to
the Effective Time, was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who, at the request of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member,
contractor, agent, trustee or fiduciary of, or otherwise provided services to,
another corporation, partnership, professional entity, joint venture, industry
association, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(collectively, with such individual's heirs, executors or administrators, the
"Indemnified Persons") as provided in the respective governing documents and
indemnification agreements to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or bound (only to the extent that such agreements have
been provided to Buyer 

prior to the date hereof), shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the
Effective Time and indemnification agreements and the provisions with respect
to indemnification and limitations on liability set forth in such governing
documents shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified; provided, that
in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six (6) year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims. The term of
indemnification under the Directors' and Officers' Indemnification shall be
limited to the lesser of six (6) years following the Closing Date or the
duration of the tail policy referred to in Section 5.5(b). Neither Buyer nor
the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
judgment in any action, proceeding or investigation or threatened action,
proceeding or investigation without the written consent of such Indemnified
Person (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase, and maintain
in effect for a period of six (6) years thereafter, (i) a tail policy to the
current policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
the Company, which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the
Closing through and including the date six (6) years after the Closing Date
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Closing, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same
coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous
than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently provided by such current policy
and (ii) "run off" coverage as provided by the Company's fiduciary and
employee benefit policies, in each case, covering those Persons who are
covered on the date hereof by such policies and with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies. The amount paid by
the Company under this Section 5.5(b) shall be referred to as the "DandO Tail
Premium." For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the DandO Tail Premium shall
be treated as a Company Transaction Expense.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 5.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

Section 5.6 Termination of Agreements; Repayment of Indebtedness. (a) Except
for the Contracts set forth in Schedule 5.6(a), the Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate any Contract between any Group Company, on the
one hand, and any Related Party, on the other hand, including the Managerial
Assistance Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement, in each case, at or prior
to the Effective Time in a manner such that the Company does not have any
liability or obligation following the Effective Time pursuant to such
agreements, subject to the survival of the indemnification provisions set
forth in the Managerial Assistance Agreement.

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer a copy of the Payoff Letter with respect to the
Indebtedness and shall have made arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
for, and at the Closing shall cause, the release of all Liens, if any,
securing such Indebtedness upon payment of such Indebtedness.

date of the Stockholder Approval, the Company shall:

(c) Each party shall provide to the other any information for inclusion in the
preparation of the Stockholder Consent, the Stockholder Notices or Section 262

other Party.

the expiration of the Claims Period with respect to indemnification claims
under Section 5.4, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
conditioned or delayed), and other than in the Ordinary Course or as required
by applicable Law, make, cause or permit to be made any Tax election or adopt
or change any method of accounting, in each case that will adversely affect
the Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

Section 5.9 Approval of 280G Payments. To the extent that the execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(either alone or in connection with another event) would entitle any current
or former Service Provider who is a "disqualified individual" to a "parachute
payment" (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code), then, prior
to the Closing, the Company shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any necessary waivers from such disqualified individuals and (ii)
submit to the Company's equityholders entitled to vote for approval, as
provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments as to which any
such Service Provider has waived his or her rights that would otherwise
entitle such Service Provider to such a parachute payment.

Section 5.10 Financing Matters.

(a) Prior to Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain debt financing through an expansion of Buyer's existing credit facility
or alternative debt financing (the "Financing").

(b) From the date hereof through the earlier of (x) the Closing Date and (y)
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall not be required to
provide, or to cause its Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation under this
Section 5.10 that (x) causes any representation or warranty in this Agreement
to be breached, (y) causes any closing condition set forth in Article VI to
fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach of this Agreement or any
Contract, or (z) requires the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective pre-Closing directors, officers, managers or employees to
execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or
instrument with respect to the Financing that become effective prior to
Closing; (ii) none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents shall be

commitment or fee that is subject to reimbursement or indemnification as set
forth below), (iii) any rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda, financing marketing materials or similar documents required or used
in 

connection with the Financing shall contain customary disclosures exculpating
the Company and their respective Affiliates with respect to any liability
related to the contents or use thereof by the recipients thereof, (iv) the
Company and their Affiliates shall not be required to issue any offering
document, (v) neither the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall

required to consent to the pre-filing of UCC-1 financing statements or any
other grant of any Lien or other encumbrances and (vii) the boards of
directors of the Company or its respective Affiliates shall not be required to

effective prior to Closing. All nonpublic or otherwise confidential
information regarding the business obtained by Buyer and its financing sources
pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer shall be permitted to
disclose such information to the lender under the Financing and its officers,
employees, representatives and advisors in connection with the Financing,
subject to customary confidentiality provisions. In no event shall the Company
be in breach of this Section 5.10 because of the failure to deliver any
financial or other information that is not currently readily prepared in the
Ordinary Course at the time requested by Buyer or for the failure to obtain
review of any financial or other information by its accountants.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in
Section 6.2(b), as it applies to the Company's and the Sellers' obligations
under this Section 5.10, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing has
not been obtained primarily as a result of the Company's material breach of
its obligations under this Section 5.10 (which breach has not been cured
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof by
Buyer).

(e) In no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any liability or expense in
connection with assisting Buyer in arranging the Financing or as a result of
any information provided by the Company or its Affiliates in connection
therewith. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives or agents from and against any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with any of their cooperation or
assistance with respect to the Financing or the provision of any information
utilized in connection therewith or otherwise arising from the Financing.
Buyer shall from time to time, promptly upon request by the Company or the
Stockholders' Representative, reimburse the Company and its Affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or
agents for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs or
expenses (including reasonable third party fees, costs and expenses of
counsel, accountants and other advisors) actually incurred by any of them in
connection with any of their cooperation or assistance with respect to the
Financing or the provision of any information utilized in connection therewith
or otherwise arising from the Financing.

their positions as an officer or director of any of the Group Companies
(solely in their capacities as directors and officers and not as employees of
the Group Companies), other than those directors and officers who Buyer
informs the Company need not resign; provided, that such resignation shall
not, in and of itself, cause any such officer to forfeit any severance or any
amounts otherwise due under any applicable employment contract between such
officer and a Group Company.

Section 5.12 Products Liability. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall purchase, and maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years

years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Closing, and which tail policy shall
contain substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently
provided by such current policies. The amount paid by the Company under this
Section 5.12 shall be referred to as the "Product and Professional Liability
Tail Premium."

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time at or
prior to the Closing:

(a) in writing, by mutual consent of the Parties;

(b) by Buyer or Merger Sub if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement made by the Company in this Agreement,
or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue or inaccurate
after the date of this Agreement, in each case which breach, untruth or
inaccuracy (i) would reasonably be expected to result in Section 6.3(a) or
Section 6.3(b) not being satisfied as of the Closing Date (a "Terminating
Company Breach"), and (ii) shall not have been cured within fifteen (15) days
after written notice from Buyer or Merger Sub of such Terminating Company
Breach is received by the Company (such notice to describe such Terminating
Company Breach in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the Buyer), or
which breach, untruth or inaccuracy, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to
the Outside Date; provided, that neither Buyer nor Merger Sub is then in
material breach of any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or other obligations under this Agreement, which breach would give
rise to a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section
6.2(b); provided, further, that the fifteen (15) day cure period for the
Company to cure a Terminating Company Breach set forth in subclause (ii) above
shall not apply if such Terminating Company Breach was a breach of Section
7.1;

(c) by the Company if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement made by Buyer or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or
any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue or inaccurate
after the date of this Agreement, in each case which breach, untruth or
inaccuracy (i) would reasonably be expected to result in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.2(b) not being satisfied as of the Closing Date (a "Terminating
Buyer Breach"), and (ii) shall not have been cured within fifteen (15) days
after written notice from the Company of such Terminating Buyer Breach is
received by Buyer (such notice to describe such Terminating Buyer Breach in
reasonable detail to the extent then known by the Company), or which breach,
untruth or inaccuracy, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside
Date; provided, that the Company is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations under this
Agreement, which breach would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth
in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b); provided, further, that the fifteen (15)
day cure period for the Buyer to cure a Terminating Buyer Breach set forth in
subclause (ii) above shall not apply if such Terminating Buyer Breach is a
result of a breach of Section 7.1;

(d) by written notice by any Party if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to September 2, 2016 (the "Outside Date") for any reason other than delay
and/or nonperformance of the Party seeking such termination;

(e) by written notice by any Party if there shall be any permanent injunction
or other order issued by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and such injunction or other order shall have become final and non-appealable
such that the closing condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) is incapable of
being satisfied; or 

(f) by Buyer, if evidence, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, of the Stockholder Approval is not delivered to Buyer by 5:00 p.m., New
York, New York time, on, or prior to, the second (2nd) Business Day following
the date hereof.

Section 8.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 by Buyer, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other parties hereto specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be
terminated and become void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability
hereunder on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, except that this
Section 8.2 and Section 5.3 (Public Announcements), Section 10.1 (Fees and
Expenses), Section 10.2 (Notices), Section 10.3 (Severability), Section 10.7
(Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.), Section 10.9 (Governing Law), and Section
10.18 (No Recourse) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing
in this Section 8.2 shall (i) relieve or release any party to this Agreement
of any liability or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party's
equityholders (taking into consideration relevant matters including other
combination opportunities and the time value of money, which shall be deemed
in such event to be damages of such party)) arising out of such party's
willful, intentional and material breach of any provision of this Agreement or
(ii) impair the right of any party hereto to compel specific performance by
the other party or parties, as the case may be, of such party's obligations
under this Agreement.

Section 8.3 Termination Fee. (a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the
Company or Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(e) where the applicable injunction or
other order is issued pursuant to any Antitrust Law, (ii) by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) due to a material breach by Buyer of Section 5.2,
which breach results in the conditions set forth in either Section 6.1(a) or
Section 6.1(b) (in each case, as such conditions apply with respect to any
Antitrust Law) being incapable of being satisfied, or (iii) by the Company or
Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and as of the Outside Date, one or more of
the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(b) (in each case, as
such conditions apply with respect to any Antitrust Law) has not been
satisfied and, in each case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), all of the other
conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or are capable of being
satisfied (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date but subject to such conditions being capable
of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of termination), then
Buyer will, within three (3) Business Days following any such termination, pay
to the Company or its designee in cash by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Company a termination fee in
an amount equal to $17,500,000.00 (the "Termination Fee"). Each Party
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral
part of this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to promptly pay any
applicable amount when due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment
against Buyer for the fee set forth in this Section 8.3 or any portion of such
fee, then Buyer shall pay to the Company its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate
published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date of payment.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
any circumstance in which the Buyer makes payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Termination Fee shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Equity Holders and any of their
respective Affiliates against Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates for all Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or thereunder or otherwise arising out of, or
directly or indirectly relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution
or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon
payment of the Termination Fee, none of Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation to the
Company, any Equity Holder or any of their respective Affiliates relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under
any theory of law or equity.



ARTICLE IX 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.1 Indemnification Obligations of Equity Holders. Subject to the
provisions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified and held harmless (solely from
amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Fund) from, against, and in respect of, any
and all Losses arising out of:

(a) Any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
Article III; (other than Section 3.13 (Taxes; Tax Returns)) determined for all
purposes without regard to any qualification or exception contained therein
relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or any similar
qualification or standard, except in the case of the representations and
warranties contained Section 3.8(b);

(b) Any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by the Company
in this Agreement that is required to be performed prior to the Closing;

(c) Any (i) demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporate Law or (ii) claim, suit, litigation or other proceeding
against any Group Company brought by any current or former stockholder of the
Company in connection with the equity interest held by such party and arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement;

(d) Any (i) Action arising out of or related to the 2007 Acquisition Agreement
or (ii) payment required, or alleged to be required, to be made pursuant to
Section 2.7(a) of the 2007 Acquisition Agreement (in each case of this clause
(ii), to the extent not reflected in Final Closing Indebtedness);

(e) Any Closing Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses, in each case to
the extent not reflected in Final Closing Indebtedness or Final Closing
Company Transaction Expenses, as applicable; and

(f) Any of the matters set forth on Schedule 9.1(f).

The Losses of Buyer Indemnified Parties described in this Section 9.1 as to
which Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
collectively referred to as "Buyer Losses".

Section 9.2 Indemnification Obligations of Buyer. Subject to the provisions of
this Article IX, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of Equity Holder Indemnified Parties from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses arising out of:

(a) Any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or Merger Sub
in Article IV determined for all purposes without regard to any qualification
or exception contained therein relating to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect or any similar qualification or standard;

(b) Any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Buyer or
Merger Sub in this Agreement.

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedure.

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of a notice from a third
party of a claim, dispute, or threatened or filed complaint or the threatened
or actual commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding (a
"Third Party Claim") with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification under this Article IX, such Indemnified Party
shall provide prompt written notice to Buyer or the Stockholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders), whichever is the appropriate
indemnifying Party under this Article IX (the "Indemnifying Party"); provided
that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from liability under this Article IX with respect to such
claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure to 

notify the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the forfeiture by the
Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or (ii) actual and material
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that, the Indemnifying Party
must first acknowledge in writing that it would have an indemnity obligation
for the Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim if (i) the Indemnifying Party does not deliver the
acknowledgement referred to in the proviso in Section 9.3(a), (ii) the Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (iii) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes that an adverse determination with respect to the Third
Party Claim would be materially detrimental to the reputation or future
business prospects of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (iv) the Third
Party Claim seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates, (v) the Third Party Claim involves a customer of the
Group Companies or (vi) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to
prosecute or vigorously defend the Third Party Claim, and such failure has not
been cured within fifteen (15) days following written notice thereof delivered
by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party. For purposes of clarity,
(i) Buyer acknowledges that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume
the defense of the matter referenced in Item 1 of Schedule 9.1(f), and (ii)
that the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to reimbursement for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in pursuing the defense of such matter from
the Specific Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(c) In any Third Party Claim with respect to which indemnification is being
sought under this Article IX, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party,
whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to
participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such Party's own
expense; provided that the foregoing will not limit such Party's ability to
recover the amount of such attorneys' fees to the extent they would otherwise
constitute indemnifiable Losses hereunder. The Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all times use reasonable
efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case
may be, reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which
they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other with
respect to the defense of any such matter.

(d) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
under this Article IX without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim unless
such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party
from all liability arising out of such claim, (ii) does not contain any
admission or statement admitting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and (iii) involves only the payment of monetary relief that
will be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund (subject to the other limitations
set forth in this Article IX).

(f) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement not involving a Third Party Claim, then such Indemnified Party shall
send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such claim to the
extent then known by the Indemnified Party. As promptly as possible after the
Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the
appropriate Indemnifying Party shall establish the merits and amount of such
claim (by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation or otherwise) and, within
five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the merits and amount
of such claim, (i) if the Indemnifying Party is the Equity Holders, then the
Stockholders' Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer in
immediately available funds an amount equal to such claim as determined under
this Article IX and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is Buyer, then Buyer shall
pay to the Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Equity Holders), an
amount equal to claim as determined under this Article IX. 

Section 9.4 Claims Period.

(a) (i) The Claims Period with respect to any claim under this Article IX
(other than any claim with respect to Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f)) or Section
5.4 shall begin on the Closing Date and terminate on the date that is fifteen
(15) months following the Closing Date (the "Initial Claims Period") and (ii)
the Claims Period with respect to any claim under Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f)
shall begin on the Closing Date and terminate on the date that is three (3)
years after the Closing Date.

(b) No claim for indemnification under this Article IX or Section 5.4 can be
made after the expiration of the applicable Claims Period; provided if prior
to the close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an
Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity
hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of
at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis
for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in
accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 9.5 Liability Limits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, except in the case of a claim for fraud in the breach
of any representation or warranty set forth in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV, the
Equity Holders' obligation to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer Indemnified
Parties harmless, and Buyer's obligation to indemnify, defend and hold the
Equity Holder Indemnified Parties harmless, shall be limited as follows:

(a) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or
Section 9.2(a) unless and until (i) each claim or series of claims arising
from the same or substantially similar facts or circumstances exceeds $50,000
(the "De Minimis Threshold") and (ii) the applicable Indemnified Parties shall
have suffered Losses in excess of $3,500,000 (the "Deductible Amount") in the
aggregate, in which case such Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
only Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; provided that amounts of
indemnity for Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.2(a) with respect
to any breach of any Company Fundamental Representation or any Buyer
Fundamental Representation, as applicable, shall not be subject to the De
Minimis Threshold or the Deductible Amount;

(a) Any indemnification obligation of the Equity Holders pursuant to (i) this
Article IX (other than any claim with respect to Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f)) or
Section 5.4 shall be satisfied solely from the General Indemnity Escrow Fund
and (ii) any claim with respect to Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f) shall be
satisfied solely from the Specific Indemnity Escrow Fund; it being understood
that nothing in this Section 9.5(b) shall limit Buyer's ability to recover
Buyer Losses under the Buyer Rep and Warranty Policy;

(b) In no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be paid by
the Equity Holders pursuant to Section 9.1 or otherwise (other than any claim
with respect to Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f)) exceed the General Indemnity Escrow
Fund, and if the General Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy any
amount of any Buyer Loss or Covered Tax (other than in connection with any
claims with respect to Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f)), then such amount of such
Buyer Loss shall remain unsatisfied (solely as between the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Equity Holders) and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover any such shortfall from any Equity Holder;

(c) In no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be paid by
the Equity Holders pursuant to any claim with respect to Item 1 on Schedule
9.1(f) exceed the Specific Indemnity Escrow Fund, and if the Specific
Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy any amount of any Buyer Loss,
then such amount of such Buyer Loss shall remain unsatisfied (solely as
between the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Equity Holders) and no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any such shortfall from any
Equity Holder;

(d) In no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be paid by
the Buyer and its Affiliates hereunder exceed $585,000,000;

(e) The amount of each claim for Buyer Losses by a Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 9.1 shall be limited to, the amount of such
Buyer Losses that remain after deducting therefrom (i) any third party
insurance proceeds (net of any increase in insurance premium with respect
thereto) and any indemnity, contributions or other similar payment actually 

recovered from any third party with respect thereto and (ii) any Tax benefit
actually realized by a Buyer Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with
respect to Buyer Losses or items giving rise to such claim for indemnification
to the extent the Tax benefit is actually realized in the year of the Buyer
Loss or item giving rise to such a claim or the following two (2) taxable
years, or a prior year, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), net of any
collection costs;

(f) The amount of indemnity payable pursuant to Section 9.1 with respect to
any Buyer Loss shall be reduced to the extent such Buyer Loss is reflected on
the Final Closing Statement;

(g) Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks
indemnification under this Article IX shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) recover for such Loss under any available third
party sources of recovery (including insurance policies), and (ii) mitigate
such Loss after becoming aware thereof, and an Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any Loss to the extent that it is attributable solely to the
Indemnified Party's failure to mitigate;

(h) No Party shall be deemed to have breached any representation or warranty
under this Agreement solely as a result of (i) any alteration, repeal or
enactment of any Law after the Closing Date (even if such alteration, repeal
or enactment is applied with retroactive effect) or (ii) any change in the
accounting policies, practices or procedures adopted by Buyer and/or its
Affiliates after the Closing Date;

(i) In any case where a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers from any third party
any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which the Equity Holders
have indemnified Buyer pursuant to this Article IX, such Buyer Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay over to the Escrow Agent, if during the applicable
Claims Period or, to the Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Equity
Holders), if after the applicable Claims Period, the amount so recovered (but
not in excess of the amount by which the Equity Holders have indemnified Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement) net of any costs of recovery;

(j) With respect to the matter referenced in Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f), the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain recovery for such matter under available insurance policies, and shall
only be permitted to recover payment from the Specific Indemnity Escrow Fund
after the Buyer Indemnified Parties have used their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such recovery; provided that, it is expressly understood and
agreed that the foregoing shall not in any way alter the time at which, or the
ability of, the Buyer Indemnified Parties would otherwise be permitted to
submit a notice of an indemnity claim pursuant to this Article IX;

(k) With respect to the matters referenced in Item 1 on Schedule 9.1(f), the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only bring claims for Losses related to or
arising out of such matter pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and not under any other
clause of Section 9.1; and

(l) The liability of the Equity Holders for Buyer Losses shall be considered
in the aggregate and shall be determined on a cumulative basis so Buyer Losses
incurred under this Article IX shall be combined with all other Buyer Losses
incurred under this Article IX for purposes of determining limitations on
liability, including the maximum liability amounts described above.

Section 9.6 Exclusive Remedies. From and after the Closing, the provisions of
Section 5.4, this Article IX and Section 10.10 set forth the exclusive rights
and remedies of the Parties to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or
relief whatsoever from any party with respect to matters arising under or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 9.5, the Parties agree
that, excluding any claim for injunctive or other equitable relief, the
indemnification provisions of Section 5.4 and this Article IX are intended to
provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all claims against either the
Company and the Equity Holders (it being acknowledged and agreed that the
Equity Holders shall have no liability under this Agreement apart from their
beneficial interests in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Adjustment Escrow
Fund), on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, may incur arising from
or relating to this Agreement and the agreements and documents contemplated
hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. In furtherance of
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Parties hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and 

causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that they may
have against the Equity Holders, the Company, Buyer, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any
such Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or based upon any
securities Law, common Law or otherwise). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 9.6, this Section 9.6 shall not operate to (a)
interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of Article II
providing for the resolution of certain disputes relating to the Merger
Consideration between the Parties and/or by the Accounting Firm, (b) limit the
rights of the Parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific
performance or injunctive relief), (c) limit the rights of the Indemnified
Persons pursuant to Section 5.5, (d) prevent or limit any claim related to
fraud based on the representations and warranties set forth in Article III or
Article IV by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (e) limit Buyer's rights or
any Equity Holder's obligations under any Support Agreement. The Parties
hereby waive and release any and all tort claims and causes of action that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any tort claim or cause
of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement).

Section 9.7 Payment of Indemnity Escrow Amount. (a) Subject to the provisions
of the Escrow Agreement, any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to
the Stockholders' Representative or its designee for further credit to the
Equity Holders shall be made as follows:

(xvii) first, that portion of such distribution as directed by the
Stockholders' Representative shall be paid to the Company, which the Company
shall distribute, less applicable withholding Tax, to the SAR Participants
through the Company's payroll system in accordance with instructions provided
by the Stockholders' Representative;

(xviii) next, the amount of such remaining distribution, if any, required to
satisfy the payments to be made to holders of the Preferred Stock pursuant to
Sections 2.2(b)(i) through (v) shall be paid to the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the holders of Preferred Stock in the order of priority set
forth in Sections 2.2(b)(i) through (v); and

(xix) thereafter, only to the extent a portion of such distribution remains
unpaid, such amount shall be paid (A) to the Paying Agent in an amount equal
to the remainder of such distribution amount multiplied by the aggregate Pro
Rata Percentages of the Stockholders, for further distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, and (B)
to the Company in an amount equal to the remainder of such distribution
multiplied by the aggregate Pro Rata Percentages of the In-the-Money Option
Holders, which the Company shall distribute through the Company's payroll
system to the In-the-Money Option Holders, less applicable withholding Tax, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages.

(b) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, if, following the expiration
of the Initial Claims Period, there are amounts remaining in the General
Indemnity Escrow Fund, then Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall
jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release such amount to the Stockholders'

Section 10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible. 

Section 10.4 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned, directly or indirectly, including by operation of law, by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided, that (i)
Buyer and Merger Sub shall be permitted, without the consent of any other
party hereto, to make a collateral assignment to any lender (or agent thereof)
providing debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) Buyer shall be permitted, without the consent of any
other party hereto, to assign its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole
or in part, to any Affiliate of Buyer; provided that, in each case of clauses

applicable, shall remain responsible for all of their respective obligations
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 10.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.5 and Section 10.18, this Agreement is exclusively for the benefit
of the Company, and its respective successors and permitted assigns, with
respect to the obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub under this Agreement, and
for the benefit of Buyer and Merger Sub, and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of the Company under this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to
any other third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of
action or other right. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Company shall have the right to enforce the rights of the Equity Holders to
pursue damages in the event of Buyer's or Merger Sub's material breach of this
Agreement, in which event the damages recoverable by the Company for itself
and on behalf of the Equity Holders shall be determined by reference to the
total amount that would have been recoverable by the Equity Holders if all
such Equity Holders brought an action against Buyer or Merger Sub and were
recognized as intended third party beneficiaries hereunder.

Section 10.6 Section Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in
this Agreement are exclusively for the purpose of reference, are not part of
the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.7 Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.. Each Party hereby irrevocably
agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be brought only to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal courts
located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. During
the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this Section 10.7
is pending before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect to
such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim,
cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court. Each Party hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any
Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not subject to the personal jurisdiction
thereof, (b) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in such court, (c) such Party's property is exempt or immune from
execution, (d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, or (e) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper. A
final judgment in any action, suit or proceeding described in this Section
10.7 following the expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject
to any stay during appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Laws. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY
LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING THERETO. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY
SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO
PARTY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, UNLESS
FAILURE TO BRING SUCH COUNTERCLAIM WOULD RESULT IN A WAIVER OR ESTOPPEL
THEREOF, OR OTHERWISE PREJUDICE SUCH PARTY'S RIGHTS IN ANY MATERIAL RESPECT.
FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A 

SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE
WAIVED.

Section 10.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal, the Support Agreements and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto or thereto constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in entering into this
Agreement, such Party has not relied on any promises or assurances, written or
oral, that are not reflected in this Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 10.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction,
effect, performance and remedies.

Section 10.10 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge that the rights of
each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and
recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non‑breaching Party may have no
adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that such non‑breaching
Party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the
other Party's obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for
damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive
and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security),
including any order, injunction or decree sought by the Company and/or the
Stockholders' Representative to cause Buyer and/or Merger Sub to perform its
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement. Each Party further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

Section 10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the
Agreement.

Section 10.12 Amendment; Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented at any time only by written agreement of the Parties.

Section 10.13 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

Section 10.14 Administrative Expense Account.

(a) The Stockholders' Representative shall hold the Administrative Expense
Amount in the Administrative Expense Account as a fund from which the
Stockholders' Representative may pay any amounts due by the Equity Holders
hereunder, including, any losses, third-party fees, expenses or costs it
incurs in performing its duties and obligations under this Agreement by or on
behalf of the Equity Holders, including fees and expenses incurred pursuant to
the procedures and provisions set forth in Section 2.8 and legal and
consultant fees, expenses and costs for reviewing, analyzing and defending any
claim or process arising under or pursuant to this Agreement (collectively,
"Administrative Costs").

(b) Amounts drawn from the Administrative Expense Account to pay
Administrative Costs shall be drawn to reflect each Equity Holder's liability
for such Administrative Costs in accordance with its respective Pro Rata
Percentage. 

(c) At such time, and from time to time, that the Stockholders' Representative
determines in its discretion that the Administrative Expense Amount will not
be required for the payment of such fees, expenses or costs, the Stockholders'
Representative shall, (i) first, distribute to the Paying Agent the amount of
such remaining Administrative Expense Amount, if any, required to satisfy the
payments to be made to holders of the Preferred Stock pursuant to Sections
2.2(b)(i) through (v), for further distribution to the holders of Preferred
Stock in the order of priority set forth in Sections 2.2(b)(i) through (v);
and (ii) thereafter, only to the extent a portion of such Administrative
Expense Amount remains unpaid, (x) pay to the Paying Agent an amount equal to
the remainder of the Administrative Expense Amount multiplied by the aggregate
Pro Rata Percentages of the Stockholders, for further distribution to the
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, and (y)
pay to the Company an amount equal to the remainder of the Administrative
Expense Amount multiplied by the aggregate Pro Rata Percentages of the In-the-
Money Option Holders, which the Company shall distribute through the Company's
payroll system, to the In-the-Money Option Holders, less applicable
withholding Tax, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages.

(d) The Stockholders' Representative shall report and withhold any Taxes (from
amounts paid by or from the Administrative Expense Account) as required by
applicable Law.

Section 10.15 Stockholders' Representative.

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, the delivery of the Letters
of Transmittal and/or acceptance of any portion of the Merger Consideration,
each Equity Holder shall be deemed to have designated the Stockholders'
Representative to execute any and all instruments or other documents on behalf
of such Equity Holder, and to do any and all other acts or things on behalf of
such Equity Holder, which the Stockholders' Representative may deem necessary
or advisable, or which may be required pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or otherwise, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and the performance of all
obligations hereunder or thereunder at or following the Closing, including,
but not limited to, the exercise of the power to: (i) negotiate and execute
the Escrow Agreement on behalf of each Equity Holder, (ii) act for each Equity
Holder with respect to any Merger Consideration Adjustment, (iii) give and
receive notices and communications to or from Buyer and/or the Escrow Agent
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions
and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement expressly contemplates that any such
notice or communication shall be given or received by such Equity Holders
individually), and (iv) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stockholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. The Stockholders' Representative shall have authority and power to
act on behalf of each Equity Holder with respect to the disposition,
settlement or other handling of all claims under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and all rights or obligations arising under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The Equity Holders shall be bound by all actions taken and
documents executed by the Stockholders' Representative in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any
action or decision of the Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders'
Representative shall receive no compensation for its services. Notices or
communications to or from the Stockholders' Representative shall constitute
notice to or from each Equity Holder.

(b) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the Stockholders'
Representative shall not be liable to any Equity Holder in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholders'
Representative. Each Equity Holder shall severally (based on each such Equity
Holder's Pro Rata Percentage), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Stockholders' Representative from and against any loss incurred without
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholders'
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder.

Section 10.16 Schedules. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto
referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement in
respect of which the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent
on its face. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in any Schedules hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher
or lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any 

obligation, items or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement

Section 10.17 Conflict Waiver. King and Spalding LLP has represented the Company
and the Equity Holders. All Parties recognize the commonality of interest that
exists and will continue to exist until Closing, and the Parties agree that
such commonality of interest should continue to be recognized after the
Closing. Specifically, Buyer agrees that (a) it shall not, and shall not cause
the Company or any Affiliate of the Company to, seek to have King and Spalding
LLP disqualified from representing any Equity Holder or such Equity Holder's
Affiliates in connection with any dispute that may arise between such parties
and Buyer or the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the basis of King and Spalding LLP's prior
representation of the Company and the Equity Holders in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) in connection with
any such dispute, the Equity Holders or the Equity Holders' Affiliates
involved in such dispute (and not Buyer or the Company) will have the right to
decide whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege that may apply to
any communications between the Company and King and Spalding LLP that occurred
prior to the Closing. Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications
among King and Spalding LLP, any Equity Holder, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, and/or the Stockholders' Representative that relate in any way
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the
Stockholders' Representative and may be controlled by the Stockholders'
Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that with respect to communications among
King and Spalding LLP and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, such agreement
shall only apply to communications occurring prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by King and Spalding LLP or any Equity Holder to such third
party; provided, however, that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders' Representative.

Section 10.18 No Recourse. Except in the case of a claim for fraud in the
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE
IV, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected
with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement),
may be made only against (and such representations and warranties are those
solely of) a Party and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such Party. No Person who is not a Party,
including any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any Party, or any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have
any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted
by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities
arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this
Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its
negotiation, execution, performance, or breach, and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Laws, each Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty
Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by
Laws, and except in the case of a claim for fraud in the breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV, (a) each
Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or
causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or
granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Party or
otherwise impose liability of a Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether
granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b) each
Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 10.18 shall limit, amend or modify any Party's 

rights, liabilities or obligations under any Letter of Transmittal or any
Support Agreement entered into by such Party.

date hereof and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. All Article,
