(b) all Accounts Receivable, subject to the terms of the
Administration Services Agreement;

  



  

(c) all Purchased Intellectual Property;

  



  

(d) all Product Registrations and the Registration Information
(including applications that are in the process of being prepared by

(i) all Proceedings, judgments and legal privileges of any nature

Section 1.2. _Nonassignable Contracts and Rights_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Assumed Contracts or
other Purchased Products and Related Assets shall be deemed sold, transferred
or assigned to either Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement if the attempted
sale, transfer or assignment thereof to such Purchaser without the consent,
novation or approval of another Person or Governmental Authority would be
ineffective or would constitute a breach of an Assumed Contract or a violation
of any Law or would in any other way materially adversely affect the rights
of Sellers (or either Purchaser as transferee or assignee) and such
consent, novation or approval is not obtained on or prior to the Closing
Date. In such case, to the extent not expressly prohibited by the applicable
Assumed Contract: (a) the beneficial interest in or to such Assumed Contracts
or other Purchased Products and Related Assets (collectively, the "
_Beneficial Rights_ ") shall in any event pass as of the Closing Date to the
applicable Purchaser under this Agreement; and (b) pending such consent,
novation or approval, and so long as the applicable Seller transfers and
turns over all Beneficial Rights with respect to each such Assumed Contract,
the applicable Purchaser shall assume or discharge the Liabilities of such
Seller under such Beneficial Rights as agent for such Seller, and such Seller
shall (and the Members of such Seller shall take all applicable steps to
cause such Seller to) act as such Purchaser's agent in the receipt of
any benefits, rights or interest received from the Beneficial Rights. Each
Seller shall, and the Members of each such Seller shall take all applicable
steps to cause Sellers to, use its commercially reasonable efforts (all at
Sellers' cost and expense) to obtain and secure any and all consents,
novations and approvals that may be necessary to effect the legal and valid
sale, transfer or assignment of the Assumed Contracts or other Purchased
Products and Related Assets underlying the Beneficial Rights, including their
formal assignment or novation, if advisable or required. The applicable
Purchaser and Sellers will make or complete such transfers as soon as
reasonably possible and cooperate with each other in any other reasonable
arrangement designed to provide for the applicable Purchaser the Beneficial
Rights, including enforcement at the cost and for the account of the
applicable Purchaser of any and all rights of Sellers against the other party
thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party
or otherwise, and to provide for the discharge by the applicable Purchaser of
any Liability arising under such Assumed Contracts or other Purchased
Products and Related Assets to the extent such Liability constitutes an
Assumed Liability. With respect to any Assumed Contracts or other Purchased
Products and Related Assets referred to above that contain a prohibition on
assignment, or the assignment of which is otherwise prohibited by Law, and
that are not assigned to either Purchaser because of the failure to obtain a
required consent, assignment or novation (" _Nontransferred Assets_ "),
Sellers shall (and Members shall take all applicable steps to cause Sellers
to) defend and hold harmless Purchasers from and against any Liability that
Purchasers may have to a third-party to the extent arising under such
Nontransferred Assets as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the extent any Assumed Contract may not be transferred or
assigned to either Purchaser by reason of any such prohibition and the
absence of any such consent, novation or approval, then, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Purchaser shall be
required to assume, satisfy or discharge any Assumed Liabilities arising under
such Assumed Contract, except to the extent relating to any Beneficial Rights
transferred to Purchasers.

Purchaser, and the applicable Seller shall retain all right, title and
interest to, in and under the Excluded Assets. " _Excluded Assets_ " means

respects on the applicable Issuance Date, except as otherwise provided in
Section 6 of the Stockholders' Rights Agreement, on each Issuance Date,
Parent shall issue to each Seller a number of Parent Shares equal to the
product of (i) its Pro Rata Share, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of
Parent Shares to be issued on such Issuance Date (as determined pursuant to
this _Section 1.8_ ) in accordance with _Schedule 1.8_. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Stock Consideration_ " shall refer to the Parent

place (unless he is thereafter otherwise elected to the Parent Board within
sixty (60) days after such meeting or within seven (7) days after the Initial
Board Date) and (B) for which Vimal Kavuru has been nominated for election to
the Parent Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any date described in
clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence is not a
Business Day, then the applicable Issuance Date shall be the first Business
Day thereafter.

  



  

(c) Additionally, (i) if any of Parent, the Purchasers or their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates commences an action to enforce the
Restrictive Covenants Agreement or any restrictive covenant in the Employment
Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction, then,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Issuance Date
following the assertion of such action shall not occur until after a Final

Law which would result in a material and adverse Tax consequence to any of
the Sellers or Members (taken together as a whole) due to the issuance of the
Stock Consideration on the applicable Issuance Date that would not otherwise
result if the Stock Consideration were issued to the Sellers before the
applicable Issuance Date (an " _Adverse Tax Change_ "), Agent may deliver
written notice of such Adverse Tax Change to Parent, requesting the
acceleration of Sellers' right to receive the Stock Consideration (an "
_Acceleration Request_ "). Any Acceleration Request shall describe the
applicable Adverse Tax Change in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by
a written opinion of Sellers' (or Agent's) outside legal counsel regarding
the material and adverse impact of such Adverse Tax Change on Sellers or
Members (taken as a whole). Parent shall consider any such Acceleration
Request promptly and in good faith, but shall have no obligation to
accelerate the grant of the Stock Consideration requested therein. In the
event that Parent grants such Acceleration Request, then the applicable
Issuance Date shall be the date on which the Stock Consideration is issued
pursuant to this _Section 1.8(d)_. Upon the enactment of a new (or change in
an existing) Law or accounting, financial, Tax or other regulatory change
applicable to Parent, Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates, that
would result in a material and adverse Tax, financial, accounting, legal or
regulatory consequence to the Parent and its Subsidiaries (taken together as a
whole) due to the issuance of the Stock Consideration on the applicable
Issuance Date that would not otherwise result if the Stock Consideration were
issued to the Sellers before or after the applicable Issuance Date or in some
other manner (an " _Adverse Legal Change_ "), Parent may deliver written
notice of such Adverse Legal Change to the Agent, requesting a change in the
applicable Issuance Date of the Stock Consideration (a " _Parent Change
Request_ "). Agent shall consider any such Parent Change Request promptly and
in good faith, but shall have no obligation to agree to any change in the
applicable Issuance Date or manner of issuance of the Stock Consideration
requested therein. In the event that Agent grants such Parent Change Request,
then the applicable Issuance Date shall be the date on which the Stock
Consideration is issued pursuant to this _Section 1.8(d)_.

preceding the Closing, a physical count of the Inventory (the " _Inventory

accordance with past practices and commercially reasonable
procedures, subject to the commercially reasonable supervision of Purchasers
and their accountants. A list of the Inventory, including the location
thereof, shall be acknowledged in writing by Sellers and Purchasers at the
Closing (the " _Inventory Acknowledgment_ ") and shall set forth the amount
of Inventory.

  



  

Section 1.10. _Withholding_. To the extent that either Purchaser is
required under any provision of Law to deduct and withhold Taxes on any
payment hereunder, such Purchaser shall withhold and deduct such required
amounts and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in respect of which such
deductions and withholdings were made.

  



  

Section 1.11. _Allocation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 1.11(d)_ , for U.S. federal income tax

shall equal the sum of such Seller's Pro Rata Share of (i) the Closing
Payment, as provided in _Section 1.7(a)_ ; (ii) the Upward Adjustment Amount,
as provided in _Section 1.13(c)(ii)_ (or, if applicable, minus the Downward

such Downward Adjustment Amount, if any, is not included in the
Equity Consideration Reduction, if any); (iii) the Deferred Payment Amount;
and (iv) subject to the Equity Consideration Reduction, the Equity
Consideration, as provided in _Section 1.8_.

  



  

(b) Within sixty (60) days following the final resolution of the
adjustments provided pursuant to _Section 1.13_ , Purchasers shall provide to
Agent an allocation statement that provides the manner in which the Purchase
Price allocated to each Seller pursuant to _Section 1.11(a)_ and the Assumed
Liabilities of each Seller shall be allocated among the Purchased Products and
Related Assets of each Seller, which allocations shall be made in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations and, to
the extent not inconsistent therewith, any other applicable Tax Law (each such
allocation statement, an " _Applicable Tax Allocation Statement_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Applicable Tax Allocation Statement shall be
subject to the review and approval of Agent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



    

 | -13-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Agent shall have the right to withhold its approval in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.11(b)_ , to any portion of
the Applicable Tax Allocation Statement by written notice to the Purchasers.
If Agent does not object to the Applicable Tax Allocation Statement by
written notice to the Purchasers within thirty (30) days after receipt by
Agent of the Applicable Tax Allocation Statement, then the Applicable Tax
Allocation Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon,
and final and conclusive, for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Applicable Tax Allocation Statement shall be subject to
adjustment upon and as a result of any adjustment to the amounts used to
determine the allocations used to prepare the Applicable Tax Allocation
Statement under this Agreement. If Agent objects to all or a portion of the
Applicable Tax Allocation Statement in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_ ,
Agent shall (within thirty (30) days after receipt by Agent of the Applicable
Tax Allocation Statement) notify Purchasers in writing of its objection to
the Applicable Tax Allocation Statement and shall set forth in such written
notice the disputed item or items and the detailed basis for its objection and
Purchasers and Agent shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute for
a period of thirty (30) days thereafter. If, within thirty (30) days after
Agent's delivery of a valid written notice of objection to the Applicable Tax
Allocation Statement, Agent and Purchasers have not reached an
agreement regarding the disputed item or items specified in such written
notice, then Agent and Purchasers shall have no further obligations pursuant
to this _Section 1.11(c)_ , and Agent on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the
other, shall each make its own determination of the allocation of the
consideration referred to in this _Section 1.11(c)_ (and all other items
required under the Code) among the Purchased Products and Related Assets;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 1.11(c)_ shall impact
the allocations set forth in _Section 1.11(a)_ or _Section 1.11(d)_.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.11_
, any Earn-Out Payment paid pursuant to _Section 1.14_ shall be
allocated solely to Seller I.

  



  

(e) _Consistent Reporting_. Each of Sellers and Purchasers shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, unless otherwise required by
a final "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code),
(i) prepare and file all Tax Returns, including all IRS Forms 8594, in a
manner consistent with this _Section 1.11_ (subject to adjustment in
accordance with _Section 1.13_ , _Section 1.14_ and _Section 9.9_ , and
otherwise in the event there is an adjustment to the Purchase Price
in accordance with _Section 9.8_ ) and (ii) take no position in any Tax
Return, Tax contest or otherwise that is inconsistent with this _Section
1.11_ (subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 1.13_ , _Section
1.14_ and _Section 9.9_ , and otherwise in the event there is an adjustment
to Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 9.8_ ). In the event that any
of the allocations set forth in this _Section 1.11_ are disputed by any Taxing
Authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify
and consult with, in the case of Parent or Purchasers, Agent, and in the case
of Sellers, Parent, concerning the resolution of such dispute, and use
reasonable best efforts to contest such dispute in a manner consistent with
this _Section 1.11_.

  



  

Section 1.12. _Tax Treatment_. Sellers, each of the Members and
Purchasers agree to treat all payments made either to or for the benefit of
the other Party under _Section 1.8_ (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 9.9(a)_
), _Section 1.13_ and _Section 1.14_  as adjustments to the Closing Payment
for all Tax purposes to the extent permitted under applicable Tax Law;
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that a portion of such amounts may
be treated as interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Section 1.13. _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) _Estimated Statement of Specified Assets and Liabilities;
Estimated Closing Statement; Estimated Calculation_. Agent shall prepare
and deliver to Purchasers not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the

acceptable to Purchasers: (i) an estimated statement of specified assets and
liabilities of Sellers as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
prepared using the methodology set forth in _Schedule 1.13(a)(i)_ and, to the
extent not inconsistent with such methodology, in accordance with GAAP, and
containing the line items referenced in such _Schedule 1.13(a)(i)_  (the "
_Estimated Statement of Specified Assets and Liabilities_ "); (ii) a statement
in the form attached as _Schedule 1.13(a)(ii)_ (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "), prepared using the methodology set forth in
_Schedule 1.13(a)(i)_ and, to the extent not inconsistent with such
methodology, in accordance with GAAP, setting forth Agent's calculation,

"), (C) the amount of Prepaid Assets (the " _Estimated Prepaid Assets Amount_
"), (D) the amount of Trade Payables (the " _Estimated Trade Payables Amount_
"), (E) the amount of Accrued Expenses (the " _Estimated Accrued

(b) _Post-Closing Determination_.

  



  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
seventy five (75) days after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall deliver to
Agent: (A) a statement of specified assets and liabilities of Sellers as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, prepared using the methodology set
forth in _Schedule 1.13(a)(i)_ and, to the extent not inconsistent with such
methodology, in accordance with GAAP, and containing the line items
referenced in such _Schedule 1.13(a)(i)_ (the " _Closing Statement of
Specified Assets and Liabilities_ "); (B) a statement in the form attached
hereto as _Schedule 1.13(a)(ii)_ (the " _Closing Statement_ "), prepared
using the methodology set forth in _Schedule 1.13(a)(i)_ and, to the extent
not inconsistent with such methodology, in accordance with GAAP, setting
forth Purchasers' calculation, based on the Closing Statement of Specified
Assets and Liabilities, of (1) the actual amount of Accounts Receivable (the "
_Closing Accounts Receivable Amount_ "), including therein, without
duplication, Purchasers' calculation of the Reserves Provision and Rebates and
Chargebacks Allowance, (2) the actual amount of Inventory, but only counting

(the " _Closing Transaction Expense Amount_ "), in each case, calculated as
of the close of business on the Closing Date, with reasonable supporting
detail, and (C) a calculation of the Closing Aggregate Amount, based on the
amounts set forth in the Closing Statement.

  



    

 | -15-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) If Agent disagrees with the calculation of the Closing Statement
of Specified Assets and Liabilities, the Closing Statement, the
Closing Accounts Receivable Amount, including the computation of the Reserves
Provision and Rebates and Chargebacks Allowance taken into account in
determining the Closing Accounts Receivable Amount, the Closing Inventory
Amount, the Closing Prepaid Assets Amount, the Closing Trade Payables Amount,
the Closing Accrued Expenses Amount, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the
Closing Transaction Expense Amount or the Closing Aggregate Amount
(collectively, the " _Closing Calculations_ "), Agent may, within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Closing Statement of Specified Assets and
Liabilities and the Closing Statement, deliver a notice (an " _Objection
Notice_ ") to Purchasers setting forth Agent's objections in reasonable
detail, and Agent's Closing Calculations, or such portion of the Closing
Calculations to which Agent objects, as applicable, with reasonable
supporting detail; _provided_ , that the nature of the objections shall only
be based on mathematical errors or on the Closing Statement not being
calculated in accordance with _Section 1.13(b)(i)_. Any amounts in the Closing
Calculations not specifically objected to by Agent in an Objection Notice
delivered to Purchasers on or prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day
period referred to above shall be deemed accepted and shall be final and
binding on Sellers and Agent. If Agent delivers an Objection Notice on or
prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period referred to above,
Purchasers and Agent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreements as to the Closing Calculations, but if there is no final
resolution with respect to any amounts remaining in dispute (the " _Disputed
Amounts_ ") within fifteen (15) days after Purchasers have received the
Objection Notice, Purchasers and Agent shall promptly (and in no event more
than five (5) days after written request by Purchasers or Agent, as the case
may be) retain Marcum LLP or, if that firm is unable or unwilling to so serve,
another nationally recognized, independent accounting firm that is
independent of Sellers, Members, Purchasers and Parent and that is reasonably
acceptable to Purchasers and Agent (the " _Accounting Firm_ "), to resolve
any disagreements relating only to the Disputed Amounts, which, in the
absence of subsequent written agreement by Purchasers and Agent, shall be the
exclusive means of resolving such items in dispute.

  



  

(iii) The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert (and not as an
arbitrator) to determine, based solely on presentations by Purchasers
and Agent and the supporting documentation referred to below in this _Section
1.13(b)(iii)_ , and not by independent review, only the Disputed Amounts and
shall be limited to those adjustments, if any, required to be made for the
Closing Calculations to comply with the provisions of this Agreement, and
shall be instructed to deliver its determination of the Disputed Amounts in
writing within thirty (30) days after its engagement. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, none of Purchasers, on the one hand, or Agent, on the
other hand, or any of their respective Representatives shall have or shall
conduct any communication, either written or oral, with the Accounting Firm
without the other either being present or receiving a concurrent copy of any
written communication. The Accounting Firm shall make a determination with
respect to the Disputed Amounts only and in a manner consistent with this
_Section 1.13_ and the methodology set forth in _Schedule 1.13(a)(i)_ and, to
the extent not inconsistent with such methodology, in accordance with GAAP,
and in no event shall the Accounting Firm assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than
the lowest value for such item claimed by either Party. Purchasers and Agent
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the Accounting
Firm such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the
Disputed Amounts as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request. Absent
manifest error, the determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Accounting Firm's written determination may be entered and reduced
to judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

  



    

 | -16-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Firm incurred in
connection with such dispute, shall be borne by the Parties (or Sellers, in
the case of Agent) in proportion to the aggregate amounts by which the sum
total of the Disputed Amounts submitted to the Accounting Firm by each such
Party (other than any dispute with respect to the Reserves Provision or the
Rebates and Chargebacks Allowance) differed from the Accounting Firm's final
determination of the sum total of the Disputed Amounts. The respective fees
and expenses of each Party's legal, financial and accounting advisors
incurred in connection with such dispute shall be borne by each such Party.

  



  

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(i) Once all disputes relating to the Closing Calculations, if any,
are or are deemed resolved in accordance with _Section 1.13(b)_ , the
Aggregate Closing Date Cash Payment shall be recalculated using the final
amounts of (1) the Closing Accounts Receivable Amount determined in
accordance with _Section 1.13(b)_ (in lieu of the Estimated Accounts
Receivable Amount used under _Section 1.7(a)_ ), (2) the Closing Inventory
Amount determined in accordance with _Section 1.13(b)_ (in lieu of the
Estimated Inventory Amount used under _Section 1.7(a)_ ), (3) the Closing
Prepaid Assets Amount determined in accordance with _Section 1.13(b) _ (in
lieu of the Estimated Prepaid Assets Amount used under _Section1.7(a)_ ), (4)
the Closing Trade Payables Amount determined in accordance with _Section
1.13(b)_ (in lieu of the Estimated Trade Payables Amount used under _Section
1.7(a)_ ), (5) the Closing Accrued Expenses Amount determined in accordance
with _Section 1.13(b)_ (in lieu of the Estimated Accrued Expenses Amount used
under _Section 1.7(a)_ ), (6) the Closing Indebtedness Amount determined in
accordance with _Section 1.13(b)_  (in lieu of the Estimated Indebtedness
Amount used under _Section 1.7(a)_ ), (7) the Closing Transaction Expense
Amount determined in accordance with _Section 1.13(b)_ (in lieu of the
Estimated Transaction Expense Amount used under _Section 1.7(a)_ ), (8) the
Positive Closing Aggregate Amount determined from the Closing Statement in
accordance with _Section 1.13(b)_ (in lieu of the Positive Estimated
Aggregate Amount determined in accordance with the definition of Estimated
Aggregate Amount), if any, (9) the Negative Closing Aggregate Amount
determined from the Closing Statement in accordance with _Section 1.13(b)_ (in
lieu of the Negative Estimated Aggregate Amount determined in accordance with
the definition of Estimated Aggregate Amount), if any, (10) the amount, if
any, by which the Positive Closing Aggregate Amount, if any, exceeds
$3,000,000 (the " _Positive Closing Surplus_ ", in lieu of the Positive
Estimate Surplus used under _Section 1.6_ ; for the avoidance of doubt, if
the Positive Closing Aggregate Amount is $3,500,000, the Positive Closing
Surplus is $500,000) and (11) the amount, if any, by which the Negative
Closing Aggregate Amount, if any, exceeds $3,000,000 (the " _Negative Closing
Shortfall_ ", in lieu of the Negative Estimated Shortfall used under _Section
1.6_ ; for the avoidance of doubt, if the Negative Closing Aggregate Amount
is $3,500,000, the Negative Closing Shortfall is $500,000) (as so recalculated
pursuant to clauses (1) through (11), the " _Adjusted Closing Payment Amount_
"). If the Adjusted Closing Payment Amount is less than the amount of the
Aggregate Closing Date Cash Payment (the amount of such shortfall, the "
_Downward Adjustment Amount_ "), then, unless Parent has notified Agent prior
to the payment contemplated by this _Section 1.13(c)_ that it intends to
reduce the Equity Consideration or the Deferred Payment Amount pursuant to
_Section 9.9_ within three (3) Business Days after the final determination of
the Downward Adjustment Amount, Sellers shall pay, and Members shall take all
applicable steps to cause Sellers to pay (including by contributing
sufficient capital to Sellers with respect thereto), to Purchasers by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account or
accounts designated in writing by Purchasers, the Downward Adjustment Amount.

  



    

 | -17-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) If the Adjusted Closing Payment Amount is greater than the
amount of the Aggregate Closing Date Cash Payment (the amount of such
excess, the " _Upward Adjustment Amount_ "), then, within three (3) Business
Days after the final determination of the Upward Adjustment Amount,
Purchasers shall pay or cause to be paid to each Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account or accounts
designated in writing by Agent, such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Upward
Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(iii) If the Adjusted Closing Payment Amount is equal to the amount of
the Aggregate Closing Date Cash Payment, no payment shall be made pursuant to
this _Section 1.13(c)_.

  



  

(iv) The procedures set forth in this _Section 1.13_ and the
adjustment to the Equity Consideration and the Deferred Payment Amount in
_Section 9.9_ shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any
Disputed Amounts.

  



  

(d) _Access to Information_. Each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide promptly to the other Parties all
information (including relevant Tax records relating to the Business or
Purchased Products and Related Assets) and reasonable access ( _provided_
, that such access shall be during normal business hours (or at such other
time consented to by Parent or Purchasers) and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of such other
Parties) to employees and accountants as such other Parties shall reasonably
request in connection with the review of the Estimated Statement of Specified
Assets and Liabilities, the Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement of Specified Assets and Liabilities, the Closing Statement or the
Objection Notice (including with respect to all of the calculations of
amounts set forth therein), as the case may be, including all work papers of
Parent and Purchasers in respect of the Purchased Products and Related Assets
and Assumed Liabilities and the accountants who audited, compiled or reviewed
such statements or notices (subject to Sellers and their representatives
executing a customary non-reliance agreement if required by Purchasers' or
Parent's accountants in connection herewith), and shall otherwise cooperate
in good faith with such other Parties to arrive at a final determination of
the Closing Statement of Specified Assets and Liabilities and the Closing
Statement.

Section 1.14. _Earn-Out_.

  



  

(a) Seller I shall be entitled to an Earn-Out Payment if, as and to
the extent earned in accordance with this _Section 1.14(a)_.  With respect to
each of the Products set forth on _Schedule 1.14(a)_ (each, an " _Earn-Out
Product_ ") which is first sold commercially by either Purchaser (the date of
such first commercial sale, the " _Launch Date_ ") before the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the following Earn-Out Payments (as defined
below) shall be made: (1) if the One Year Anniversary Date (as defined below)
for such Earn-Out Product occurs on or before the Earn-Out End Date (as
defined below), Purchasers shall pay to Seller I in cash an amount equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the Adjusted Gross Profit, if any, earned by
Purchasers from sales of such Earn-Out Product (each such payment, an " _Earn-
Out Payment_ ") (x) during the period beginning on the Launch Date for such
Earn-Out Product and ending on the First Month End Date (as defined
below) for such Earn-Out Product, within ninety (90) days after such First
Month End Date (or within five (5) days after the resolution of any dispute
under _Section 1.14(b)_ ) and (y) during the period beginning on the day
immediately following such First Month End Date for such Earn-Out Product and
ending on the earlier of the Second Month End Date (as defined below) for such
Earn-Out Product and the Earn-Out End Date, within ninety (90) days after the
earlier of such Second Month End Date and the Earn-Out End Date (or within
five (5) days after the resolution of any dispute under _Section 1.14(b)_ ) or
(2) if such One Year Anniversary Date for such Earn-Out Product occurs after
the Earn-Out End Date, Purchasers shall pay to Seller I in cash an amount
equal to the Earn-Out Payment earned by Purchasers from sales of such Earn-
Out Product during the period of time beginning on the Launch Date for such
Earn-Out Product and ending on the Earn-Out End Date, within ninety (90) days
after the Earn-Out End Date (or within five (5) days after the resolution of
any dispute under _Section 1.14(b)_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Earn-
Out Payment shall not be earned by Seller I, or paid by Purchasers, unless
and until, and only to the extent that, Adjusted Gross Profit for the Earn-
Out Products, taken together, exceeds the aggregate Development Costs incurred
by Purchasers and/or Parent, as the case may be, with respect to the Earn-Out
Products, taken together; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no further
payments shall be due under this _Section 1.14(a)_ once the aggregate amount
of such Earn-Out Payments (the " _Earn-Out Amount_ ") for all Earn-Out
Products equals fifty million dollars ($50,000,000). For purposes of this
_Section 1.14(a)_ (i) the " _One Year Anniversary Date_ " for a particular
Earn-Out Product shall mean the one year anniversary of the Launch Date for
such Earn-Out Product, (ii) the " _First Month End Date_ " for a particular
Earn-Out Product shall mean the last day of the calendar month in which the
One Year Anniversary Date for such Earn-Out Product occurs, (iii) the " _Two
Year Anniversary Date_ " for a particular Earn-Out Product shall mean the two
year anniversary of the Launch Date for such Earn-Out Product, (iv) the "
_Second Month End Date_ " for a particular Earn-Out Product shall mean the
last day of the calendar month in which the Two Year Anniversary Date for
such Earn-Out Product occurs and (v) the " _Earn-Out End Date_ " shall mean
the last day of the calendar month in which the five (5) year anniversary of
the Closing Date occurs.

  



    

 | -19-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) At least five (5) days prior to a payment being due pursuant to
_Section 1.14(a)_ , Parent shall calculate the Development Costs and the
applicable Adjusted Gross Profit, and deliver to Agent a notice setting forth
such calculation, and the corresponding payment due to Seller I (each such
notice, an " _Earn-Out Statement_ "). After receipt of each Earn-Out
Statement, Agent shall have thirty (30) days to review and accept or disagree
with the same. If Agent disagrees in good faith with the computation of the
Development Costs or the applicable Adjusted Gross Profit or the corresponding
payment set forth in the Earn-Out Statement due only to mathematical errors
or that it was not calculated in accordance with this Agreement, Agent may,
within such thirty (30) day period deliver an objection notice (an " _Earn-
Out Objection Notice_ ") to Parent setting forth Agent's calculation of the
Adjusted Gross Profit on the applicable Earn-Out Product for the applicable
period, the Development Costs and the corresponding payment amount, if any,
along with a statement setting forth Agent's objections and, to the extent
Agent is reasonably able to specify, adjustments to the Earn-Out Statement in
reasonable detail. If Agent fails to deliver an Earn-Out Objection Notice to
Parent on or prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period referred
to above, the Earn-Out Statement and the calculation of Development Costs and
Adjusted Gross Profit and the corresponding payment amount set forth therein
shall be final and binding on the Sellers and Agent. If Agent delivers an
Earn-Out Objection Notice on or prior to the expiration of such thirty (30)
day period referred to above, Parent and Agent shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any disagreements regarding the computation of Adjusted Gross
Profit, Development Costs and the corresponding payment amount set forth
therein, but if there is no final resolution within fifteen (15) days after
Parent has received the Objection Notice, Parent and Agent shall
jointly retain the Accounting Firm in accordance with _Section 1.13(b)(ii)_ ,
and the provisions of _Sections 1.13(b)(iii)_ and  _(iv)_ shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ to the resolution of the foregoing dispute.

  



  

(c) From and after the Closing and until all of the Earn-Out
Payments have been paid or until Seller I (or its successors or permitted
assigns) has no further rights thereto, in addition to any information rights
that any Seller or Member may have pursuant to this Agreement or the
Stockholders' Rights Agreement, on an annual basis, Agent (or an accounting
firm or other third party engaged by Agent at its sole expense) may review
the books and records of Purchasers and Parent relating to the Earn-Out
Products and the potential payment of the applicable Earn-Out Payments and,
as necessary, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, any member of
Parent and Purchasers, in each case, as solely relating to the Earn-Out
Products; _provided_ , that such access shall be during normal business hours
(or at such other time consented to by Parent or Purchasers) and in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of
Parent or Purchasers. Parent and Purchasers shall provide to Agent for
informational purposes, within thirty (30) days after the end of each fiscal
quarter of Parent until all of the Earn-Out Payments have been paid or
until Seller I (or its successors or permitted assigns) has no further rights
thereto, a statement setting forth Parent's calculation of Adjusted Gross
Profit for each Earn-Out Product and Development Costs for the Earn-Out
Products during such fiscal quarter.

  



  

(d) Any payments pursuant to this _Section 1.14_ shall constitute an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Sellers hereby expressly acknowledge and agree
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, there is no
requirement, guaranty or other assurance of any kind that Sellers shall
receive all or any portion of the Earn-Out Amount and Sellers' right to
receive any such Earn-Out Amount shall be governed solely and exclusively
by the express provisions of this _Section 1.14_.

  



    

 | -20-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) From and after the Closing, none of Purchasers, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, advisors or
other agents shall have any fiduciary duty or any other obligation with
respect to the Earn-Out Amount and Purchasers and Parent shall be free to
operate the Business in any manner they determine, in their sole and absolute
discretion, without regard to custom and practice, course of dealing or any
similar doctrine, and without any obligation to minimize Development Costs or
maximize Adjusted Gross Profit or sales of any Earn-Out Product. For purposes
of emphasis, none of Parent, Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates
shall have any obligation to launch or sell any of the Earn-Out Products at
any time, subject to the terms of _Section 1.14(i)_.

  



  

(f) Purchasers shall have the right to withhold and set off against
any amount otherwise due to be paid pursuant to this _Section 1.14_ , the
amount of (i) any Downward Adjustment Amount owed to it pursuant to _Section
1.13(c)_ , (ii) any Losses to which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may be
entitled under _ARTICLE IX_ of this Agreement, and (iii) any other obligations
of any Seller or Member pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement.

  



  

(g) Except as set forth in _Schedule 9.9_ , Seller I may not sell,
exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive
any Earn-Out Payment.

  



  

(h) Parent and/or Purchasers shall make a final determination as to
whether to fund the development and launch of each Earn-Out Product
within three (3) months after the Closing Date and if a determination is made
not to fund any Earn-Out Product (a " _Negative Determination_ ") then within
thirty (30) days after the making of a Negative Determination with respect to
an Earn-Out Product, Parent and/or Purchasers, as the case may be, shall
transfer, assign and convey ownership of such Earn-Out Product to Seller I or
its Affiliate at no cost to Seller I or its Affiliate.

  



  

(i) If Parent and/or Purchasers make a determination to fund an
Earn-Out Product that receives final approval from the FDA to
commercialize such Earn-Out Product, at any time during the five (5) year
period immediately following the Closing, Parent and/or Purchasers, as the
case may be, shall act in a commercially reasonable manner to commercialize
such Earn-Out Product and shall not take any action during such five (5) year
period which is primarily intended to prevent or frustrate the
commercialization of such Earn-Out Product; _provided_ , that the failure to
launch such Earn-Out Product shall in and of itself not be deemed a breach of
this Agreement.

Section 1.15. _Deferred Payment Amount_. On the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein (including _Section 9.9_ ), on the later
of (x) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) the earlier of
(i) the six (6) month anniversary of the termination and payment in full of
all obligations, other than contingent indemnification obligations and any
obligations that are cash collateralized or for which other credit support
has been provided, of Parent and Purchasers under the Definitive
Agreements as in effect on the Closing Date and (ii) the date that is five
(5) years and six (6) months after the Closing Date (such later date, the "
_Deferred Payment Date_ "), provided that no "Default" or "Event of
Default" (each as defined in the Definitive Agreements as in effect on the
Closing Date) shall have occurred and is then continuing or would result
therefrom, Purchasers shall pay to Sellers, in accordance with each Seller's
Pro Rata Share, to one or more accounts designated in writing by Agent at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Deferred Payment Date, cash
consideration in an aggregate amount equal to $50,000,000 (the " _Deferred
Payment Amount_ "), _minus_ any Deferred Payment Amount Reduction, and
_minus_ the amount of any then pending claim that has been asserted on or
before the Offset Date for Losses of any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to _ARTICLE IX_ , if any, for which Parent could effect a Deferred Payment
Amount Reduction upon a Final Determination in favor of such Purchaser
Indemnified Party (each, a " _Pending Claim_ "). The Deferred Payment Amount
shall bear interest, payable to Sellers, in accordance with each Seller's Pro
Rata Share, to one or more accounts designated in writing by Agent at least
five (5) Business Days prior to any Interest Payment Date (as defined below),
at an annual rate equal to the Interest Rate then in effect, based on a three
hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) thirty (30) day
months. Such interest shall be payable, subject to any restriction or
limitation due to a Default or Event of Default that has occurred and is
continuing, or would result therefrom, under the Definitive Agreements as in
effect on the Closing Date (A) annually in arrears on the first Business Day
after each of the first five (5) anniversaries of the Closing Date and (B)
if the Deferred Payment Date is later than the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, in arrears on the Deferred Payment Date, for the period
beginning on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the
Deferred Payment Date (each of the foregoing payment dates in (A) and (B), an
" _Interest Payment Date_ "); _provided_  that interest shall not accrue on
any amount conclusively determined to be subject to a Deferred Payment Amount
Reduction, but shall accrue on the amount of any Pending Claim until the
Final Determination thereof. Upon the occurrence of a Deferred
Payment Default, the overdue amount shall bear interest at the Default Rate
from the date of such Deferred Payment Default until such overdue amount is
paid in full. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
Parent has delivered to Agent written notice of one or more Pending Claims on
or before the Offset Date, then a portion of the Deferred Payment Amount equal
to the amount of any such Pending Claims may be retained by Purchasers until
the Final Determination thereof (even if after the Deferred Payment Date)
and, following such Final Determination, Purchasers may effect a Deferred
Payment Amount Reduction for such amount or portion thereof in accordance
with such Final Determination. Purchasers shall have the right, in their sole
and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, to prepay all or
any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount together with any accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, without any penalty or premium.

information contained in the Books and Records; (ii) other than with respect
to the Financial Statements of Citgen described in clause (b) above, have

service provider of either Seller, or give rise to any obligation to fund

and approvals necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Party shall promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) inform the other Parties of any written communications with any
Governmental Antitrust Entity regarding any such filings or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law and the terms
hereof, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in connection
with any analyses, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made
or submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating to Proceedings under the
HSR Act or other Competition Laws and/or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Antitrust Entity. In connection with and without

 | -56-|

(b) Without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this
_Section 7.3_ , the Parties shall provide or cause to be provided as promptly
as practicable to any Governmental Antitrust Entity information and documents
requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or

reasonable efforts, including cooperating in good faith with the other
Parties, to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Competition Law. Purchasers and
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may
be required to cause the timely expiration or early termination of the notice
periods under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible after the
execution of this Agreement. In the event that Purchasers decide to litigate
any decision by a Governmental Antitrust Entity, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchasers in such
litigation. Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other
hand, shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all fees
associated with the filing of the Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act.

  



  

(c) For the purposes of this _Section 7.3_ , "commercially
reasonable efforts" of Purchasers and Parent shall include (a) entering into
a consent decree containing Purchasers and Parent's agreement to hold separate
and divest (pursuant to such terms as may be required by any Governmental
Authority) assets as may be determined by any Governmental Authority;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , nothing in this Agreement will require Purchasers
or Parent to take any actions, including entering into any consent decree,
hold separate orders or other arrangements, that require the divestiture of
any assets of the Purchasers or Parent or limits Parent's freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Purchased Products and Related
Assets or any of Parent's or its affiliates' other assets or businesses, or
in Parent's reasonable judgment would be expected to have a material adverse
impact on any of its businesses, or the businesses to be acquired by it
pursuant to this Agreement, either individually or in the aggregate, other
than actions which, in the aggregate, involve assets that collectively
generated total worldwide revenues of less than the equivalent of USD
$10,000,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year.

  



  

(d) In addition, with regard to any Governmental Antitrust Entity,
none of Sellers, Members or any of their Affiliates shall,
without Purchasers' prior written consent in Purchasers' sole discretion,
discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to
alter their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise
discuss, take or commit to take any action that limits Purchasers' freedom of
action with respect to, or Purchasers' ability to retain, any of
the Purchased Products and Related Assets or otherwise receive the full
benefits of this Agreement.

reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur as soon as possible after
the date hereof, including (a) satisfying the conditions precedent set forth
in _ARTICLE VIII_ within the control of such Party, (b) subject to _Section

other in good faith such other agreements, documents, instruments and/or

hereby and thereby. Prior to the Closing and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Sellers shall (and Members shall cause Sellers
to) use their reasonable best efforts to take all corporate actions, subject
to the occurrence of the Closing, necessary and reasonably requested by
Parent or Purchasers to permit the consummation of the Financing on the
Closing Date.

(a) After the Closing, and without further consideration, each
Seller and Member shall execute and deliver to Purchasers, and Members

may reasonably request in order to more effectively convey and transfer the
Purchased Products and Related Assets to Purchasers Each Seller and Member
shall, and Members shall take all applicable steps to cause Sellers to,
execute any and all documents and to perform such other acts as may be
necessary or expedient to further the purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) To the extent that, during the twelve (12) months following the
Closing, any of Purchasers or Sellers discovers that any Purchased Products
and Related Assets have not been transferred to either Purchaser (in
circumstances other than as contemplated by _Section 1.2_ ) or that any of
the Excluded Assets have been transferred to either Purchaser, it shall
promptly notify the other Parties, and the Parties shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, ensure that such property is transferred, at the
expense of Sellers and with any necessary prior third party consent or
approval, to (i) Purchasers or their designated assignee, in the case of any
Purchased Products and Related Assets which were not transferred to either
Purchaser at Closing, or (ii) Sellers or their designated assignee, in the
case of any Excluded Asset which was transferred to either Purchaser at
Closing. Pending such transfer, at Sellers' expense, Purchasers or Sellers,
as applicable, shall hold in trust such Purchased Products and Related Assets
or Excluded Asset, as applicable, and provide to the other Party or its
designated assignee all of the benefits associated with the ownership of
such Purchased Products and Related Assets or Excluded Asset, as applicable,
and cause such Purchased Products and Related Assets or Excluded Asset, as
applicable, to be used or retained as may be reasonably instructed by the
other Party.

  



    

 | -58-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, for Tax purposes, any
Excluded Asset referred to in _Section 7.6(b)_ shall be considered to have

Sellers hereby agree to waive compliance with the requirements and provisions
of Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in any jurisdiction
that may be applicable with respect to the sale to Purchasers of any or all of
the Business, the Products or the Purchased Products and Related Assets.

  



  

(b) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Sellers have provided
(and, to the extent applicable, caused their Affiliates to provide)
to Purchasers all of the information relating to Sellers (or their
Affiliates, as applicable) that Purchasers require in order to file a New
Jersey Form C-9600 - Notification of Sale, Transfer, or Assignment in Bulk
(the " _Form C-9600_ ") with the New Jersey Department of Treasury, Division
of Taxation, Bulk Sales Unit (the " _Department_ "),. Promptly after the
execution of this Agreement, Purchasers shall file with the Department the
Form C-9600 as so agreed upon, together with an executed copy of this
Agreement. If, subsequent to such filing, the Department requests that Sellers
file a New Jersey Form TTD - Asset Transfer Tax Declaration (a "
_Declaration_ "), Agent shall (and Members shall take all applicable steps to
cause Sellers to) promptly prepare and file the Declaration on behalf of
Sellers, the form and substance of which shall be mutually agreed by Agent
and Parent. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to respond to any
inquiries from, or requests for information to be submitted to, the
Department. The Closing shall not occur until Purchasers have received a
notification from the Department pursuant to the New Jersey Bulk Sale Law
(N.J.S.A. 54:50-38) regarding the amount, if any, of the Purchase Price that
is required by the Department to be escrowed at the Closing by Purchasers (the
" _Tax Escrow_ "). If the Department notifies Purchasers that an amount,
including Sellers' estimated New Jersey tax liability on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, is required to be included in the Tax Escrow,
such amount shall be withheld from the Closing Payment by Purchasers and be
considered a Retained Liability until Sellers' liability for such amount is
finally determined by the Department. After the Closing, any portion of the
Tax Escrow that is finally determined pursuant to the New Jersey Bulk Sale Law
to be properly due and owed by Sellers to the Department shall be paid by
Purchasers to the Department from the Tax Escrow, and all other
remaining funds in the Tax Escrow shall be promptly disbursed by Purchasers
to Sellers in accordance with written allocation instructions theretofore
received from and executed by Agent. In the event that the Department
determines that the Tax Escrow is not sufficient to satisfy all outstanding
amounts required to be paid to the Department pursuant to the New Jersey Bulk
Sale Law, Sellers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Department any
further amount necessary to satisfy the Department's determination.

Section 7.8. _Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Sellers shall use best efforts to cause their product liability
insurance carriers, and any carriers that issued "occurrence" based polices,
to expressly name Parent and Purchasers as additional insureds on Sellers'
product liability Insurance Policies, with respect to any matters or claims
arising from or related to the Purchased Products and Related Assets and
Business to the extent arising from or related to facts or events that
occurred at or prior to the Closing. These product liability Insurance
Policies shall also provide by endorsement that (i) they are primary with no
right of contribution from any insurance policies issued to Parent or
Purchaser; and (ii) the insurance companies waive any rights of subrogation
against Purchaser and Parent. Sellers shall be solely and fully responsible
for any deductibles, retentions, or co-insurance in the product liability
Insurance Policies.

  



  

(b)  Contemporaneously with the Closing, Sellers shall purchase, at
their sole expense, "run-off" coverage for their respective product liability
Insurance Policies for a period of six (6) years from the date of Closing with
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous than the current product
liability Insurance Policies with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing.

  



  

Section 7.9. _Employees_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof and through the Closing, Sellers shall
provide Parent, Purchasers and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
employees of Sellers, their Affiliates and Subsidiaries and the Books and
Records relating to such employees, for the purpose of evaluating to which
employees, if any, Purchasers and their Affiliates may desire to offer
employment as of the close of business on the Closing Date pursuant to this
_Section 7.9(a)_. Sellers, Members and their respective Affiliates and
Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate with, and provide reasonable
assistance to, Purchasers, Parent and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives to enable them to make such evaluations. No later than
ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, Purchasers shall deliver to Sellers
a list of Sellers' employees to whom either Purchaser (or an Affiliate of
either Purchaser) intends to offer employment as of the close of business on
the Closing Date. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each Seller
shall terminate the employment of all of such employees effective as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. Within fifteen (15) days after Closing
each Seller shall cause to be discharged, satisfied and paid in full to all
of its employees an amount equal to (i) all Liabilities associated with any
severance obligations owed to such employees pursuant to any Employee Benefit
Plan, including any employment agreement, offer letter or compensation
arrangement or applicable Law, and (ii) any other amounts such employees may
be entitled to receive as the result of employment termination,
including accrued wages, accrued and unused vacation and other paid time off
and accrued bonuses, if any. Those of Sellers' employees who receive and
accept either Purchaser's (or any such Affiliate's) offer of employment and
report to work for active duty with such Purchaser (or any such Affiliate)
immediately following the Closing are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Hired Employees_." Each Seller shall, effective as of the close of business
on the Closing Date, release all Hired Employees from and, if requested by
Purchasers, assign to Purchasers or an Affiliate of Purchasers its rights
under any non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and similar
restrictive covenants or agreements and any assignment of inventions
agreements previously entered into between such Seller and such Hired
Employees. Each Seller shall deliver to Purchasers, at or before the Closing
Date, written evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to Purchasers, of
the release and assignment described in the immediately preceding sentence.
Nothing herein shall confer upon any Hired Employee any right to be employed
by either Purchaser or any Affiliate of either Purchaser for any specified
period of time following the Closing Date or in any way limit Purchasers' or
any of their Affiliates' right to terminate the employment of any Hired
Employee at any time following the Closing Date for any reason (or no
reason).

(b) Purchasers (or an applicable Affiliate) shall provide each Hired
Employee, until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, total annual
compensation which is no less favorable than the total annual compensation in
effect with respect to such Hired Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date. To the extent that any filings are required with the USCIS with respect
to any Hired Employees on H1 or Practical Training Visas, the Parties agree
that such Hired Employees will remain on the applicable Seller's payroll for
such transitionary period, and Sellers will invoice Purchasers for such
services.

  



  

(c) With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, Sellers shall take
any necessary actions to cause, as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, Hired Employees and their eligible spouses, dependents, and
beneficiaries who are covered under such Employee Benefit Plan to cease
coverage under such Employee Benefit Plan. Each Seller shall, at its own
expense, terminate each Hired Employee's participation under each Employee
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and take such further
actions after the Closing Date as may be necessary, appropriate or advisable
to distribute all benefits accrued or payable thereunder and to otherwise
satisfy all obligations arising thereunder, in each case, with respect to the
Hired Employees.

  



  

(d) From and after the close of business on the Closing Date,
Purchasers (or an applicable Affiliate) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to give each Hired Employee full credit for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except vacation,
if applicable) under any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA) (excluding both any post-retirement health or other welfare plans
or programs and any equity compensation arrangements maintained by Purchasers
or any of their Affiliates) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to
by Purchasers (or an applicable Affiliate) in which such Hired Employee will
participate effective as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ "), for such Hired Employee's
service with Sellers to the extent recognized by Sellers under the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan, except to the extent that (i) such
credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of
service, or (ii) such service is with respect to a newly-established Purchaser
Benefit Plan for which similarly-situated employees of Purchasers or their
Affiliates do not receive past service credit.

  



  

(e) Purchasers (or an applicable Affiliate) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive for each Hired Employee, and his or her
dependents, any waiting period provision, pre-existing condition limitation,
and actively-at-work requirements under Purchaser Benefit Plans that are
"employee welfare benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Welfare Plans_ "). Purchasers (or an
applicable Affiliate) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give full
credit under the Purchaser Welfare Plans for all co-payments made and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing Date in the same plan year as the
Closing Date. Claims incurred by a Hired Employee with respect to any welfare
benefit plan following the close of business on the Closing Date shall be the
responsibility of the applicable Purchaser Welfare Plan, subject to the terms
and conditions of such Purchaser Welfare Plan. Claims incurred with respect
to any welfare benefit plan for Hired Employees rendered prior to close of
business on the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of the welfare
benefit plan of the Seller which covered such employees prior to close of
business on the Closing Date.

(f) This  _Section 7.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 7.9_ , express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 7.9_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement.

  



  

Section 7.10.   _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting Sellers' obligation to deliver the Required
Information as set forth herein, each of Parent and Purchasers shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and obtain Financing and the proceeds thereof on the terms and
conditions described herein and in the Commitment Letter including (i)
maintaining in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiating definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ")
consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) or, if
available, on other terms that are acceptable to each of Parent and
Purchasers and no less favorable in any material respect (as determined by
each of Parent and Purchasers, in their sole and absolute discretion), to
each of Parent and/or Purchasers than the terms set forth in the Commitment
Letter and would not adversely affect in any material respect (including
delaying the timing beyond the applicable dates set forth in _Section
10.1(b)_ ) the ability of each of Parent and Purchasers to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent, Purchasers and their respective
Subsidiaries in the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements that are
within their respective control and complying with their
respective obligations thereunder, (iv) complying with their respective
obligations under the Commitment Letter, and (v) if the conditions to the
Financing have been satisfied or waived, in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements, as applicable,
consummate the Financing in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
Commitment Letter and Definitive Agreements. Each of Parent and Purchasers
shall use reasonable best efforts to comply with its obligations, and
reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights, under the Commitment Letter in
a timely and diligent manner; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of
Purchasers or Parent shall be required to commence a Proceeding against any
Financing Source.

  



    

 | -62-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) None of Purchasers or Parent shall, without the prior written
consent of Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that it shall be deemed reasonable to
withhold consent if any of the following could reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the Closing beyond the applicable dates set forth in _Section
10.1(b)_ ): (i) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver would (A) prevent the Closing Date from occurring or
delay the Closing beyond the applicable dates set forth in  _Section 10.1(b)_
, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount, when taken
together with the Closing Cash Contribution, that would be insufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay
related fees and expenses (unless Parent or either Purchaser has arranged an
alternative source of funds to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, delivers commitment letters and remakes the representations and
warranties in _Section 6.10_ hereof with respect to such alternative source
of funds and commitment letters, and pursues such source of funds with the
same obligations imposed on it under this _Section 7.10_ in respect of the
Financing), (C) materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or any
Purchaser to enforce their rights against other parties to the Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, modified or waived,
relative to the ability of Parent or any Purchaser to enforce their rights
against such other parties to the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof or in the Definitive Agreements, or (D) make the funding of the
Financing or the satisfaction of any condition thereunder materially less
likely to occur, other than (x) to obtain a waiver of any closing conditions
by Financing Source(s) or their agents, or (y) to add Financing Sources, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; or (ii) release,
terminate or consent to the release or termination of the obligations of any
Financing Sources or other Persons under the Commitment Letter in a manner
that would prevent the Closing from occurring or delay the Closing beyond the
applicable dates set forth in _Section 10.1(b)_. Parent or Purchasers shall
(x) promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days prior to execution
of any such proposed amendment, modification, waiver, release, termination or
consent, or notice thereof) deliver to Agent copies of any such proposed
amendment, modification, waiver, release, termination or consent, and (y)
promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days after the execution
of any such proposed amendment, modification, waiver, release, termination or
consent, or notice thereof) deliver to Agent copies of any such executed
amendment, modification, waiver, release, termination or consent, in each case
subject to redaction of fees, hold levels, pricing, economic "flex" terms and
other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with
acquisition agreements of this type; _provided_ , that any failure by Parent
or Purchasers to timely deliver to Agent copies of any such executed
amendment, modification, waiver, release, termination or consent or any error
in doing so shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Agent
hereunder and none of Parent or Purchasers shall be in breach or default
hereunder as a result of any such failure or error if Parent and Purchasers
deliver such copies during the five (5) Business Day period immediately
following receipt by Parent of written notice of such failure or error from
Sellers. Agent shall, as soon as practicable, and in no event later than two
(2) Business Days after receipt thereof, respond to a request for consent
under this _Section 7.10(b)_.

  



    

 | -63-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent or Purchasers
shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt
financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the Closing Cash
Contribution, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to pay related fees and expenses) from the same or other sources and
which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative
debt financing that are more onerous to Parent or Purchasers than the
conditions set forth in the Financing and are otherwise on terms no less
favorable to Parent or Purchasers than such unavailable Financing (including
the "flex" provisions), and (ii) promptly (but in any event within two (2)
days after receipt of notice of the unavailability of all or any portion of
the Financing) notify Agent of such unavailability and, to the Knowledge of
Parent and to the Knowledge of Purchasers, the reason therefor. For the
purposes of this _Section 7.10_ , the term " _Commitment Letter_ " shall be
deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect
to any alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any
Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question) and the term "
_Financing_ " shall be deemed to include any financing contemplated by any
commitment letter as permitted by this _Section 7.10_ to be amended or
modified or replaced by any alternative financing arranged in compliance
herewith prior to the Closing. Parent and Purchasers shall remake the
representations set forth in _Section 6.10_ hereof with respect to any such
alternate Commitment Letter and Financing upon the arrangement thereof. Prior
to the Closing, Parent or Purchasers shall provide Agent with prompt (but in
any event within five (5) days after receipt of notice regarding any of the
items hereinafter set forth) written notice if (A) to the Knowledge of Parent
or Purchasers, there exists any breach or default by any party to the
Commitment Letter, any letter or agreement related thereto or the Definitive
Agreements or any expiration or termination (or attempted or purported
termination, whether or not valid) of the obligations of any
Financing Sources or other Persons under the Commitment Letter, (B) Parent or
Purchasers receive any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source or other source with respect to (x) any actual or threatened
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Agreements of any provision thereof, or (y) any
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter
or other Definitive Agreement, if applicable, with respect to the obligation
to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing
or (C) for any reason, Parent or Purchasers no longer believe in good faith
that they will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms described therein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or Purchasers be under
any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (A), (B) or (C)
that is subject to attorney-client, common interest, joint defense or similar
privilege if Parent or Purchasers shall have used their commercially
reasonable efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive
such privilege. In the event that Parent or Purchasers do not provide access
or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, Parent or Purchasers
shall provide notice to Agent that such access or information is being
withheld and Parent or Purchasers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way that would not violate the applicable obligation or risk waiver of such
privilege. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Purchasers shall keep
Agent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the material developments concerning the Financing, provide to Agent prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to the Financing and
provide to Agent, upon reasonable request, executed copies of the material
Definitive Agreements, if any, and such other information and documentation
available to them as shall be reasonably requested by any Seller for
purposes of monitoring the progress of the Financing and the financing
activities related thereto, in each case, including only those redactions as
described in the definition of Redacted Fee Letter set forth herein.

having to post any bond), it being acknowledged and agreed that any such
breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Parent and
Purchasers and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to
Parent or Purchaser.

  



  

Section 7.14. _Trade Notification_. Sellers and Purchasers shall
mutually agree on the method, content, form and timing of notifications to
manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, customers and other third parties of
the sale of the Purchased Products and Related Assets to Purchasers, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by any of
Sellers. Sellers and Purchasers agree to provide sufficient advance notice
prior to Closing to such Persons of the transactions contemplated hereby and
the plans associated therewith, so as to provide a smooth transition of the
Business from Sellers to Purchasers.

Section 7.18. _Public Announcements_.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
disseminate a press release in the form and substance of the press
release heretofore agreed upon by Parent and Sellers.

  



    

 | -70-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent may, if it so determines, arrange one or more conference
calls, subsequent press releases or other means for publicly disclosing the
transactions contemplated hereby, independent of the Financing. To the extent
feasible, Parent will consult with Agent prior to conducting such conference
calls or pursuing such other forms of communication.

  



  

(c) Within four (4) Business Days after the execution of this
Agreement, Parent intends to file with the SEC the Acquisition 8-K (as
defined in the Commitment Letter) pursuant to which it will describe the
transactions contemplated hereby and pursuant to which it may file, as
required, with the SEC a copy of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and
other documents related thereto.

  



  

(d) In connection with the Financing and other steps that Parent may
take to raise equity or debt capital, and in other filings that Parent may be
required to make under the Exchange Act, Parent may make such other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as are required by Law in the
opinion of Parent's counsel, subject, except in the case of filings that
Parent may be required to make under the Exchange Act, to prior notice to
Sellers if practicable.

requirements of the SEC or the rules of NASDAQ and/or any quotation system or
exchange upon which any security of Parent is traded or quoted, as the case
may be.

  



  

(g) Following the Closing, except as otherwise required by Law,
Sellers and Members shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to,

Section 7.19. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

  



  

(a) Sellers and Members shall promptly notify Purchasers and Parent,
and Parent and Purchasers shall promptly notify Sellers and Members,
in writing of: (a) receipt of any notice from any third party alleging that
the consent of the third party is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) any Material Adverse Effect with respect
to Sellers, the Business or the Purchased Products and Related Assets; (c)
any event, state of facts, occurrence, non-occurrence, circumstance,
development or change that would reasonably be expected to cause a failure of
any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.1_  or _Section 8.2_
; (d) any Proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge (for purposes of this
_Section 7.19_ , the term "knowledge" shall mean the Knowledge of Sellers,
the Knowledge of Members, the Knowledge of Purchasers or the Knowledge of
Parent, as applicable), threatened, involving or affecting any Party, the
Business or any Party's respective properties, employees, owners or
assets, including the Purchased Products and Related Assets, including any
Proceeding commenced, or to its knowledge, threatened by any Governmental
Authority; or (e) any violation, or alleged violation, of Law by Sellers or
Members (or any employees or owners of the foregoing) or otherwise relating
to the Business or the Purchased Products and Related Assets.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
notification or investigation by any Party shall affect the representations,
warranties, indemnities or other covenants of any Party or the conditions to
the obligations of any Party hereunder, nor shall it limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party receiving such notice.
If any event, state of facts, occurrence, non-occurrence, circumstance,
development or change first occurs or develops during the period commencing
immediately after the execution of this Agreement by Sellers and ending on
the second (2nd) Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, which
would reasonably be expected to cause a failure of any of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_, then Agent shall
provide prompt written notice thereof to Parent and Purchasers pursuant to
_Section 7.19(a)_ (a " _Condition Failure Notification_ "), and Parent and
Agent shall, within the thirty (30) consecutive calendar day period
immediately following Parent's and Purchasers' receipt of such Condition
Failure Notification (or such longer period as shall be mutually agreed by
Parent and Agent) (a " _Negotiation Period_ "), engage in good faith
negotiations in an attempt to determine the amount of Losses that would
reasonably likely be suffered by Purchaser Indemnified Parties and any other
amendments to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements as may reasonably be
expected to be necessary, appropriate or advisable in respect thereof,
arising or resulting from the matter(s) set forth in the Condition Failure
Notification.  In the event that the Parties are unable to agree upon the
amount of such Losses or any of the terms of such amendments during the
Negotiation Period, then the amount of such Losses and any such proposed
amendments shall be promptly submitted to arbitration by a panel of three (3)
arbitrators selected by mutual agreement of Parent and Agent or, failing such
agreement, by a panel of three (3) arbitrators experienced in mergers and
acquisitions that are selected in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ") then in effect solely for the
purposes of determining the dollar amount of such Losses and any such
amendments. All such Losses constitute Retained Liabilities hereunder, and, as
a result, the Purchaser Indemnification Parties shall be entitled to full
indemnification with respect to such Losses pursuant to _Article IX_. The
Parties hereto shall reform this Agreement and any applicable Ancillary
Agreements to incorporate any such arbitral award and any such
amendments (which reformed agreements shall be valid, binding and enforceable
against the Parties). The arbitration shall take place in New York City, in
accordance with the rules of the AAA then in effect, and judgment upon any
award rendered in such arbitration will be binding and may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. There shall be limited discovery prior to
the arbitration hearing as follows: (a) exchange of witness lists and copies
of documentary evidence and documents relating to or arising out of the
issues to be arbitrated, (b) depositions of all party witnesses and (c) such
other depositions as may be allowed by the arbitrators upon a showing of good
cause. Depositions shall be conducted in accordance with the New York Code of
Civil Procedure. The arbitrators shall be directed to provide in writing to
the parties the basis for the award or order of such arbitrators. A court
reporter shall record all hearings, with such record constituting the official
transcript of such proceedings.  Each party will bear its own costs in
respect of any such dispute. Parent, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand, shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the
arbitrators' compensation charges and the administrative fees of the AAA.
The parties knowingly and voluntarily agree to this arbitration provision and
acknowledge that such arbitration shall be instead of any civil litigation,
meaning that the parties each are waiving any rights to a jury trial in
connection with the foregoing matters. If (x) Agent delivers a Condition
Failure Notification to Parent and Purchasers, and (y) Closing otherwise
would have occurred under _Section 2.1_ during the applicable Negotiation
Period, but for the delivery of the Condition Failure Notification and the
operation of this sentence, then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Closing shall occur as otherwise provided in and subject
to the conditions of _Section 2.1_ , but in no event sooner than the date
(the " _Extension Date_ ") that is on (A) the tenth (10th) calendar day after
the date on which Closing otherwise would have occurred under _Section 2.1_
but for the delivery of the Condition Failure Notification and the operation
of this sentence, and (B) the first Business Day after the last day of the
Negotiation Period; it being understood if there are more than one Condition
Failure Notifications given, then the provisions of this _Section 7.19(b)_
shall be successively complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, the
occurrence of the Closing while the amount of Losses and any amendments have
not been determined shall not in any way be deemed a waiver, or otherwise
diminish the entitlement of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' rights to
indemnification hereunder, in respect of the applicable Condition Failure
Notification.

for the quarterly periods ended on March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and (if the
Closing is after November 15, 2016) September 30, 2016 (collectively with the
financial statements in clauses (a) and (b), the " _Additional Reviewed
Statements_ "). The Additional Reviewed Statements shall: (i) be true,
correct and complete in all material respects; (ii) be derived from and
prepared in accordance with the information contained in the Books and
Records; (iii) be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, throughout the periods covered thereby; and (iv) present accurately
and fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows of Seller I, Seller II and Citgen as of
the times and for the periods referred to therein, subject to (A) the absence
of footnote disclosures and other presentation items, and (B) changes
resulting from normal year-end adjustments (the effect of which will not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material). The Additional Reviewed
Statements shall be accompanied by an unqualified certification of each
Seller's and Citgen's chief financial officer (or similar executive officer)
to the effect that the Additional Reviewed Statements conform to the
requirements of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon delivery to Parent,
the Additional Reviewed Statements shall be considered "Reviewed Financial
Statements" for purposes of this Agreement. There shall be no changes in the
method of application of Sellers' and Citgen's accounting policies or changes
in the method of applying Sellers' and Citgen's use of estimates in the
preparation of the Additional Reviewed Statements as compared with the
Audited Financial Statements.

be paid at Closing, and with respect to each such Person: (a) the dollar

Entity Member shall (a) maintain its existence and all franchises in full
force and effect in accordance with applicable Law; (b) maintain an adequate
level of capital so as not to be deemed insolvent under applicable Law; (c)
not liquidate, dissolve, wind-up its affairs or agree to adopt a plan to
effect any of the foregoing, or otherwise take any material steps to effect
any of the foregoing; _provided_ , that at any time after the later of (x)
the first (1st) anniversary of the Second Issuance Date and (y) the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, each Seller and each of Member I and
Member II and each Indirect Entity Member may liquidate, dissolve and wind-up
its operations unless there are then pending any indemnification claims by
any Purchaser Indemnified Parties, in which case, Purchasers' prior written
consent to such liquidation, dissolution and winding-up shall be required; and
(d) not take any other action that would have the effect of avoiding
Liability under this Agreement or depriving Purchasers of recourse under this
Agreement or under any Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.23. _Medicaid  and Other Government Rebates_. From and after
the Closing Date, Sellers shall comply with all of their obligations with
respect to Medicaid and other government rebate claims as further provided

,  _further_ , that Parent reserves the right to withhold any information and
to exclude Vimal Kavuru from any meeting or portion thereof if access to such
information or attendance at such meeting could adversely affect the attorney-
client privilege between the Company and its counsel or result in disclosure

Purchasers in connection with the tendering of such claims to the applicable
insurers under such Insurance Policies, including providing Purchasers with a

dispute regarding the date of any loss or occurrence, the terms of the

 | -83-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Effect of Knowledge_. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known
that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in
_ARTICLE VIII_. The waiver of a condition to Closing set forth in _Section
8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_ shall not affect a Party's right to
indemnification.

  



  

(f) _No Double Indemnity_. No claim for indemnification may be made
by a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party and no
indemnification shall be required to the extent that the Loss sustained or
incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, was (i) accrued or reserved for on the Closing Statement, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.13(b)_ , or (ii) otherwise adjusted
for in the calculation of the Adjusted Closing Payment Amount. None of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under one

Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, have already
indefeasibly recovered Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to other
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Mitigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no Indemnified Party seeking indemnity under this _ARTICLE
IX_  shall be under any obligation to mitigate any Losses for which
indemnification may be available pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ ;  _provided_
, that to the extent an Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of a Loss
indemnifiable under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_  (other than with respect to Sellers'
Fundamental Representations, Members' Fundamental Representations and
Excluded Claims) for which indemnification may be sought under this
Agreement, is able to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such
Loss in a manner known to such Indemnified Party and fails to do so when
reasonably requested in writing by Agent to take a specific mitigation step,
then the applicable Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify the
Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE IX_ for the amount of any incremental
Losses incurred solely as a result of the Indemnified Party's failure to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses.

  



  

(h) _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by any Indemnified Party under insurance policies
or any other source of indemnification with respect to such Loss, less any
expenses incurred in pursuing such insurance proceeds or other source of
indemnification; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be
obligated to commence any Proceeding to obtain any such remedy.

Section 9.5. _Procedures for Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event any claim or demand for which any Seller
Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnified Party_
") may have Liability is or may be asserted against, or sought to be collected
from, any Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") and
for which such Indemnified Party may seek indemnity under this _ARTICLE IX_
such Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver a Claim Notice in accordance
with _Section 9.6_ to the Party responsible for indemnification (such
responsible Party, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") describing such Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , when the Indemnifying Party is a Seller or
Member, such Claim Notice only need be given to the Agent. A failure by the
Indemnified Party to give a Claim Notice and to tender the conduct or defense
of the action or suit in a timely manner pursuant to this _Section 9.5(a)_
shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE
IX_ , except (i) to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced by failure to give such Claim Notice, or (ii) to the
extent the Claim Notice has not been given pursuant to this _Section 9.5(a)_
prior to the expiration or termination of the applicable survival period
provided in _Section 9.3_ (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder). Subject to the
other provisions of this _Section 9.5_ , the Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) calendar days (or such lesser number of days as set forth in the
Claim Notice as may be required by court Proceeding in the event of a
litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ")
to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party may only assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim if
the Indemnifying Party agrees in a writing acceptable to the Indemnified
Party that it accepts full and unconditional liability for the indemnification
thereof under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim and so agrees to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in connection therewith, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its option and at
its own expense, to be represented by reputable counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party, and to control, defend against or otherwise deal
with such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party may participate in (but not control) any such Proceeding with counsel
of its choice and at its expense; but the Indemnifying Party shall control the
investigation, defense and settlement thereof;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
continue control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim if (i) the Third-
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or
regulatory Proceeding; (ii) the Indemnifying Party is one or more Sellers or
one or more Members and the Third-Party Claim relates to or is attributable
to any Taxes or Tax Returns, unless such Third-Party Claim relates solely to
Excluded Taxes and unless agreed to by Purchasers in writing; (iii) based on
the advice of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict (including the
availability of different or additional defenses) exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with such Third-
Party Claim or conduct of a claim by the Indemnifying Party would compromise
any legal privilege or similar doctrine with respect to the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates; (iv) the Third-Party Claim seeks (A) an injunction
against the Indemnified Party, or (B) where the Indemnified Party is a
Purchaser Indemnified Party, equitable relief requiring the taking of
action or the refraining from taking actions by Purchasers or any of their
Affiliates; or (v) the Indemnifying Party fails to promptly assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

  



    

 | -85-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) To the extent the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to assume
the defense of such matter, including by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend, (ii) is not permitted to assume the
defense of such matter pursuant to _Section 9.5(b)_ , or (iii) after assuming
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps to defend
diligently such Third-Party Claim within ten (10) calendar days (or such
shorter period to avoid missing a deadline in any Proceeding) after
receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party of the Indemnified
Party's reasonable and good faith determination that the Indemnifying Party
has so failed, then the Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, and control the defense of such Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated
pursuant to this _Section 9.5(c)_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in addition to any local counsel who may need to
be retained; and it being understood that the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification for a Third-Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by
assuming the defense of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _further_ ,
however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense,
and (ii) with respect to the defense of a matter pursuant to _Section
9.5(b)(ii)_ that relates to Excluded Taxes, but also to taxes for any other
tax period (or portion thereof), Sellers shall have the right to participate
in (but not control), at their own expense, the defense of the Third Party
Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify
the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into
or any judgment consented to without the Indemnifying Party's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party has the right and does elect to defend
any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall conduct the defense of
such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and promptly inform the
Indemnified Party of the status of the claim, including all settlement
negotiations, and all material developments with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any
discussions relating to the litigation strategy implemented with respect to
the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its own expense; _provided_ , that
the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 9.5_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or
threatened Third-Party Claim on a basis that would not include an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party or would (i) exceed the
balance of the Indemnifying Party's indemnity obligations hereunder (and, in
the case of any Purchaser Indemnified Party, would exceed the portion of the
Deferred Payment Amount then available for reduction pursuant to _Section
9.9(b)_ ), (ii) result in the imposition of a Governmental Order that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates, (iii) result in a finding or admission of a violation of
requirements of Laws or violation of the rights of any Person by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or (iv) impose ongoing obligations
on the Indemnified Party following the date of such settlement or compromise.

(e) The Parties shall cooperate fully and in good faith in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third-Party
Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the provision
of each Party's respective records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and (ii) making employees and other
Representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production or other disclosure of
confidential information (consistent with applicable Laws), and to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to
a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-
client or work-product privileges.

  



  

Section 9.6. _Procedures for Inter-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) If any Party (the " _Claimant_ ") elects to assert an
indemnification claim against another Party hereto, the Claimant shall
promptly deliver to such other Party (except where the other Party is a Seller
Indemnified Party, notice only need be given to the Agent) a written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") setting forth: (i) the section or sections of this
Agreement (or any other applicable Ancillary Agreement) pursuant to which it
seeks indemnification, including, if applicable, the specific representation
and warranty or covenant alleged to have been breached by such other Party;
(ii) a detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the
indemnification claim (to the extent then known to the Claimant), including,
if applicable, the alleged breach of such representation and warranty or
covenant; and (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable under the
circumstances, and only if then known, a detailed description and estimate of
the total amount of the Losses actually incurred by the Claimant. Following
delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate
and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim
for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such
matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable
access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such
matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and
resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance
with respect to such matters.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 9.4(d)_ , the Indemnifying Party shall pay
all amounts payable pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account specified in writing by the
Indemnified Party promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of an
invoice with respect to a Loss in respect to a claim for which the Indemnified
Party timely delivered a Claim Notice, together with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation, unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith
disputes the Loss or its obligation to provide indemnification with respect
thereto, in which event, it shall so notify the Indemnified Party reasonably
promptly following receipt of such invoice, setting forth in reasonable
detail, and with supporting documentation (if any), the basis for such
dispute. Any amount of such Loss that is not so disputed shall be due and
payable by the Indemnifying Party within five (5) Business Days following the
Indemnifying Party's receipt of the invoice and supporting documentation in
respect of such Loss. With respect to any such Loss that the Indemnifying
Party disputes in good faith, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall negotiate in good faith for a period of up to thirty (30) days
regarding the resolution of any disputed claims for Losses; _provided_ , that
such thirty (30) day period shall not preclude commencement of any
Proceeding to enforce the Claimant's rights. If no resolution is reached with
regard to such disputed claim between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to seek available remedies in accordance with the terms
hereof in accordance with applicable Law. No later than three (3) Business
Days following the Final Determination of the amount of any Losses claimed by
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay such Losses to the Indemnified Party by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to an account specified by the
Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party is required to
institute Proceedings in order to recover Losses hereunder, the cost of such
Proceedings (including costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements) shall be added to the amount of Losses payable to the
Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party recovers Losses in such
Proceedings, except as otherwise provided in a Final Determination with
respect thereto. In the event that a Party claiming to be an
Indemnified Party institutes Proceedings in order to recover Losses hereunder
and the applicable court refuses to award any Losses to such Party, such
Party shall reimburse the defending Party for the cost of such Proceedings
(including costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements). A " _Final Determination_ " shall exist when the parties to
the dispute have reached an agreement in writing or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable Governmental Order
resolving such dispute.

Section 9.7. _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Should the Closing occur,
the remedies provided for in this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of any Indemnified Party in respect of this Agreement, the
Restrictive Covenants Agreement (other than the Restrictive Covenants
Agreement executed and delivered by Ashok Mayya), the Administration Services
Agreement, the Joint Development Definitive Agreements, the Voting Agreement,
the Stockholders' Rights Agreement, the Purchased Products and Related Assets,
the Products, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Retained
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Restrictive Covenants Agreement, the Administration Services Agreement, the
Joint Development Definitive Agreements, the Voting Agreement and the
Stockholders' Rights Agreement, other than (a) for actions for specific
performance or other equitable remedies, (b) with respect to resolving any
Disputed Amounts, which shall be governed by the procedures set forth in
_Section 1.13_ , (c) with respect to resolving any dispute regarding the
Earn-Out Amount, which shall be governed by the procedures set forth in 
_Section 1.14_ , (d) for Excluded Claims, or (e) available remedies under the
Real Estate Lease Agreement; in the case of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and
(e), all remedies at Law or in equity shall be cumulative.

  



  

Section 9.8. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
payments made pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 9.9. _Equity Consideration Reduction; Deferred Payment
Amount Reduction_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Second Issuance Date, Parent shall have the right,
in its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time, to reduce
the aggregate number of Parent Shares that comprise the Equity Consideration
by a number of Parent Shares equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest
whole number) of (i) the sum of (x) the portion of the Downward Adjustment
Amount, if any, owed pursuant to _Section 1.13(c)(i)_ , _plus_ , (y) any or
all Losses that any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to recover
pursuant to this  _ARTICLE IX_ based on a Final Determination thereof, _plus_
(z) any other obligation of any Seller or Member owed to Purchasers, Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the
Administration Services Agreement or the Joint Development Definitive
Agreements, _divided by_ (ii) the greater of (x) the volume-weighted average
price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the
thirty (30) consecutive calendar day period ending on the Business Day
immediately prior to the delivery by Parent to Agent of written notice of the
reduction described in this _Section 9.9_ , and (y) $20.50 (an " _Equity
Consideration Reduction_ "). An Equity Consideration Reduction shall satisfy
the portion of the payment obligation described in clause (i) of the
immediately preceding sentence, but only to the extent of the value of the
Equity Consideration Reduction based on the amount set forth in clause (ii)
of such sentence. Except as set forth in _Schedule 9.9_ , the right of the
Sellers to receive all or a portion of the Equity Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.8_ and this _Section 9.9(a)_  shall not be assigned by any Seller
to any other Person.

  



    

 | -88-|

(b) On or before the Offset Date, Parent shall have the right, in
its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time, to reduce the
Deferred Payment Amount, dollar for dollar, by (x) the portion of the
Downward Adjustment Amount, if any, owed pursuant to _Section 1.13(c)(i)_
, and (y) any or all Losses that any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled
to recover pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ based on a Final Determination
thereof (a " _Deferred Payment Amount Reduction_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, immediately after the Offset Date, the Deferred Payment Amount
shall be deemed absolute and unconditional and not subject to any further set-
off, defense, counterclaim, rescission, recoupment or adjustment whatsoever
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any Deferred Payment Amount
Reduction with respect to the Final Determination of any then Pending Claim,
and any prior Deferred Payment Amount Reduction that has been effected).
Except as set forth in _Schedule 9.9_ , the right of the Sellers to receive
all or a portion of the Deferred Payment Amount pursuant to _Section 1.15_
and this _Section 9.9(b)_ shall not be assigned by any Seller to any other
Person.

terminating Party); or (ii) if a Condition Failure Notification is delivered
by Agent to Purchasers and Parent pursuant to _Section 7.19(b)_ and the

Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no Party shall
have any liability to the other Parties or their respective Affiliates,

Agreement; _provided_ , that such Seller and such Member (and not Agent)
shall control any and all claims against such Seller or such Member, as

and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE III_ or _ARTICLE IV_ , as applicable, or
any covenant of such Seller or such Member, as applicable, hereunder if not
completely covered by the Limitation Amount. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of Agent shall constitute a decision of all Sellers and all

instruction of each and every such Seller and each and every such Member
without any independent obligation to investigate the Agent's authority, and

Agreement and shall be binding on Sellers and Members as a matter of contract
Law. This appointment of agency and this power of attorney is coupled with an
interest and will be irrevocable and will not be terminated by either Seller

receive no compensation for its services from Purchasers or any of their
Affiliates after the Closing. Notices or communications to or from Agent shall
constitute notice to or from each Seller and each Member for all purposes.
Each Seller and each Member hereby agrees to receive correspondence from
Agent, including by e-mail transmission to any e-mail address set forth in
the notice provisions of this Agreement or subsequently provided to Agent by
such Seller or such Member, as applicable.

severally indemnify and hold Agent harmless against any loss, Liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of Agent
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
its duties hereunder.

may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Purchasers and Agent, or
in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be

Section 12.3. _Assignment_. Except as specifically provided in
_Section 9.9_ , no Party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent
and Agent; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent or each
Purchaser from making any assignment (a) to any of its Affiliates so long as
such Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms, conditions,
and provisions contained in this Agreement applicable to Parent or each
Purchaser, as the case may be, (b) following Closing to any successors to all
or substantially all of the Purchased Products and Related Assets or
otherwise to any successors to all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Parent or such Purchaser, whether in a merger, consolidation, sale
of substantially all assets or other similar transaction, or (c) to any
Financing Source or lender as collateral security following Closing. Any
purported assignment, hypothecation or transfer in breach of this _Section
12.3_ shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties hereto and
their successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 12.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (in each case, including all Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices
hereto and thereto) contain the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for: (a)
the Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect for
the term provided for therein; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon the Closing
without further action by the parties thereto; and (b) any written agreement
of the Parties that expressly provides that it is not superseded by this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.5. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Parent, Purchasers, Sellers,
Members or their successors or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , that (a) the provisions of
_ARTICLE IX_ shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
and the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, (b) the provisions of
_Section 12.12_ shall inure to the benefit of the Persons referenced therein,
(c) the provisions of _ARTICLE XI_ shall inure to the benefit of the Agent and
(d) the provisions of _Section 6.10_ ,  _Section 7.1_ , _Section 7.10_ ,
_Section 10.2_ , _Section 12.2_ , this _Section 12.5_ , _Section 12.7_ , 
_Section 12.8_ and _Section 12.11_ shall inure to the benefit of the Financing
Sources.

Section 12.6. _Expenses, Transfer Taxes and Property Taxes;
Cooperation_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement
(including all filing fees in connection with the filings made pursuant to
_Section 7.3_ ), whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the
Party incurring such expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers
shall pay fifty percent (50%), on the one hand, and the Sellers shall pay
fifty percent (50%), on the other hand, of all Transfer Taxes. Purchasers
shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns or other
applicable documents in connection therewith, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Sellers shall (and Members shall take all applicable steps to
cause Sellers to) cooperate with the Purchasers in the preparation and filing
of all Tax Returns or other applicable documents for or with respect to
Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(b) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date, (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes
and similar Taxes imposed with respect to the Purchased Products and Related
Assets or Related to the Business (" _Property Taxes_ ") shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period on a per
diem basis, and (ii) all other Taxes imposed with respect to the Purchased
Products and Related Assets or Related to the Business (other than Transfer
Taxes which shall be borne as provided in _Section 12.6(a)_ ) shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
as though the taxable period terminated as of the effective time of the
Closing. Sellers and Purchasers shall promptly reimburse each other in
accordance with such allocation for any such Property Taxes which any Party is
required to pay under applicable Law, with such reimbursement to be reflected
in the Payout Spreadsheet and treated as a Purchase Price adjustment. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding this _Section 12.6(b)_ , Purchasers shall
not assume any Liability for any Excluded Taxes.

  



  

(c) Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other hand,
shall (i) provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested by the other in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return,
audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority or judicial or
administrative Proceeding relating to Liability for Taxes in connection with
the Business or the Purchased Products and Related Assets, (ii) retain and
provide the other with any records or other information that may be relevant
to such Tax Return, Proceeding or determination, and (iii) inform the other
of any final determination of any such Proceeding or determination that
affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other for
any period.

  



  

Section 12.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement and
its negotiation, execution, performance or non-performance, interpretation,
termination, construction and all Proceedings that may be based upon, arise
out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of New York regardless of Laws that might otherwise govern under
any applicable conflict of Laws principles.

  



    

 | -95-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (i)
consents and submits for itself and its property in any Proceeding
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement and its negotiation,

6. _Liquidation, Dissolution, Etc._ In the event of any distribution, division or application, partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, of all or any part of the assets of any Loan Party or the proceeds thereof, in whatever form, to creditors of such Loan Party, or upon any indebtedness of such Loan Party, by reason of the liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of such Loan Party or such Loan Party's business, or by reason of any Insolvency Proceeding of such Loan Party, then and in any such event, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to any or all of the Subordinated Debt (including without limitation any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by virtue of the provisions of any securities which are subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Subordinated Debt) shall not be paid or delivered to any Subordinated Creditor until the occurrence of the Termination Date.

7. _Waivers_. Each Subordinated Creditor agrees and consents (a) to waive, and does hereby waive, any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension, modification, compromise or release of any of the Senior Debt or any collateral therefor or guaranties thereof, in whole or in part; (b) that without further notice to or further assent by such Subordinated Creditor, the liability of any Loan Party or any other party or parties for or upon any of the Senior Debt may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, increased, extended, modified, compromised or released by the Senior Creditors as they may deem advisable; and (c) that any collateral for or guaranties of the Senior Debt, or any part of the Senior Debt, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be modified, released, collected, sold or otherwise disposed of by the Senior Creditors as they may deem advisable and that any balance of funds with any Senior Creditor at any time standing to the credit of any Loan Party may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be surrendered or released by such Senior Creditor as it may deem advisable. Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in this _Section 7_ , the Senior Creditors shall not modify the negative covenants (other than any financial covenants or as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the Joint Fee Letter) to the Senior Debt in a manner that would prohibit (i) the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debt or (ii) the payment of principal of the Subordinated Debt on or after the Subordinated Debt Maturity Date, unless in each case, a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

  



  

8. _Pledge or Transfer of Subordinated Debt_. Each Subordinated Creditor agrees not to assign, transfer, pledge, or grant a security interest in all or any part of the Subordinated Debt unless (a) such assignment, transfer, pledge or grant is made expressly subject to this Agreement and (b) such Subordinated Creditor's assignee, transferee, pledgee or grantee expressly agrees in writing to assume such Subordinated Creditor's obligations hereunder.

  



  

9. _Continuing Agreement and Termination_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement is a continuing agreement and this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect until the Termination Date regardless of
whether the Senior Debt is from time to time reduced and thereafter increased
or entirely extinguished and thereafter re-incurred or incurred anew. This
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall be irrevocable until
and shall terminate on the Termination Date. No notice purporting to
terminate this Agreement which is received by any Senior Creditor at any time
prior to the Termination Date shall be effective, in any manner or at any
time whatsoever, to terminate this Agreement.

  



  

(b) This Agreement shall continue to be effective regardless of the
solvency or insolvency of any Loan Party or any Subordinated Creditor; the
liquidation or dissolution of any Loan Party or any Subordinated Creditor; the
institution by or against any Loan Party or any Subordinated Creditor of any
proceeding under any federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect; the appointment of a
receiver or trustee for any Loan Party or any property of any Loan Party
or for any Subordinated Creditor or any of Subordinated Creditor's property;
any reorganization, merger or consolidation of any Loan Party or any
Subordinated Creditor; or any other change in the ownership, composition or
nature of any Loan Party or any Subordinated Creditor.

  



  

(c) Until the Termination Date, this Agreement shall be and remain
absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and no act or
omission on the part of any Senior Creditor shall affect or impair the terms
or conditions hereof unless directly in breach or violation hereof or unless
expressly agreed upon in writing by the Administrative Agent to the extent not
prohibited by the Credit Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Senior Creditors may change any of the terms of the
Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (other than this
Agreement), may make new loans, issue new letters of credit, or extend other
new credit to the Loan Parties, or grant renewals, increases, extensions or
other indulgences of or with respect to Senior Debt or the Collateral or take
any action for the enforcement of, or waive any rights with respect to, any of
the Senior Debt or the Collateral, all without any requirement on any Senior
Creditor's part that it give notice of the same to the Subordinated Creditors
or obtain the Subordinated Creditors' consent thereto and all without
affecting, impairing or releasing any of the Subordinated Creditors'
obligations under this Agreement.
