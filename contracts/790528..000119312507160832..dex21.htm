prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_
hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to

shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(e) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock and Convertible
Preferred Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
without any interest thereon pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and _Section
3.1(c)_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the

_Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of outstanding Common Stock or
Convertible Preferred Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock or Convertible Preferred
Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2_, the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such share of Common
Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock held by them.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares Representing
Common Stock_.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered,
in trust, to The Bank of New York, or such other paying agent mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Consideration
Fund_ ") to be paid to such holders pursuant to this  _Section 3.2._

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose
shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as

affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the
form and  



 

11  substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ ,
and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates. If any
Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose
name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share or Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
investments shall be in (i) securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed
or insured by the United States government or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and having maturities of not more than one month from the date of
investment or (ii) money market mutual or similar funds having assets in
excess of $1,000,000,000. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall
be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No
investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of
such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Consideration Fund. If, at any time prior to the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, or
effectively withdraws or loses such holders right to dissent from the Merger
under the DGCL, Parent shall promptly provide, or cause the Company to
promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of Merger
Consideration payable with respect to Dissenting Shares held by such holder.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent covenants and agrees that it shall
maintain sufficient cash-on-hand or availability under its credit facilities
to be able to meet its obligation under this Section 3.2(c). 

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock and Convertible
Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Article III_ , except as otherwise provided by Law.



 

12 (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation or, at Parents direction, Parent. Any holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for payment of
their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the
Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof.

(g) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this _Article III_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Law relating
to the payment of Taxes.

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is
entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) Each option to purchase Common Stock issued by the Company and outstanding
at the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable (" _Company
Option_ "), will at the Effective Time be automatically cancelled, and the
holder of each such Company Option will be entitled to receive from the
Company as of  



 

13  the Effective Time, cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of each such Company Option, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Common
Stock covered by such Company Option (the aggregate amount of such cash, the "
_Option Consideration_ "), with such payment to be subject to applicable Tax
withholding.

(b) Not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such actions as may be required to cause each restricted stock award
granted under the Companys 2002 Incentive Stock Plan or any other equity-
based compensation plan (taking into account, if applicable, any such
provisions with respect to such restricted stock grant as provided in the CIC
Plans) and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (each, a "
_Restricted Stock Award_ ") to fully vest as of the Effective Time and such
Restricted Stock Award shall be canceled and the shares of Common Stock
issued pursuant to such Restricted Stock Award shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in the same
manner as other shares of Common Stock under _Section 3.1_. 

(c) Each performance award granted under the Companys 2002 Incentive Stock
Plan (each, a " _Performance Award_ ") shall be cancelled effective as of the
Closing in exchange for a cash payment to be made by the Company at the
Closing in the amount provided by the applicable underlying award agreement
and, if applicable, by the CIC Plans (the aggregate amount of such cash, the
" _Performance Award Consideration_ "), without interest, with such payment to
be subject to applicable Tax withholding.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in applying _Article III_ of this Agreement
regarding the treatment of stock options and other equity-based awards, the
provisions of any award agreements and the provisions of any CIC Plans
regarding a change in control shall be applied first and immediately prior in
time to the application of _Article III_ of this Agreement, and any stock
options that are paid or settled in Common Stock upon a change in control
under the terms of such agreements and CIC Plans shall be treated for purposes
of _Article III_ of this Agreement (including _Section 3.1(a)_) as resulting
in Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, its Board of Directors and the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall take all such actions
permitted under the Companys 2002 Incentive Stock Plan and any other Company
Equity Plan, the stock option agreements, Restricted Stock Awards or
Performance Awards or agreements relating thereto and otherwise, to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section 3.3_. The Company shall cause each of the
Company Equity Plans to be terminated according to their terms, effective as
of and conditioned upon, the Closing; _provided_ that any amounts payable
under the terms of such Company Equity Plans or the CIC Plans shall remain
payable pursuant to such terms.



 

14 Section 3.4 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock or Convertible
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth herein, unless
and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, his right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock, and Parent shall
have the opportunity to reasonably participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes the number of shares of Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock,
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or stock
dividend or stock distribution, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after the
date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment
in accordance with this sentence.

organization and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease

have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Sub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and

31  and Sub (and assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the Company) is a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and

any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational document) of Parent or Sub, (ii) result in a violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both)
a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be
bound, (iii) violate any Law applicable to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their properties or assets or (iv) require on the part of Parent or
Sub any filing or registration with, notification to, or authorization,

(ii), (iii) and (iv) for such violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations or accelerations that, or filings, registrations,
notifications, authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to
make or obtain would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.4 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2006, Parent has
not suffered a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.5 _Compliance with Law_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or in default under, any Law, in each
case, applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets and properties.

assets, engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other
than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.7 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied by Parent or
Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement
is first mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company
Special



 

32  Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

Section 5.8 _Brokers or Finders_. No investment banker, broker, finder,
consultant or intermediary is entitled to any investment banking, brokerage,
finders or similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.9 _Sufficient Funds_. _Section 5.9_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth complete and accurate copies of (a) executed commitment
letters (the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ ") from the lenders named therein
(the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth
therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and (b) executed commitment letter
(the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment
Letters, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from the investors named therein
(the " _Investors_ "), pursuant to which the Investors have committed to
invest the amounts set forth therein, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the Debt
Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and
will continue to provide, that the Company is a third-party beneficiary
thereof. As of the date hereof, and as of the Closing, the funds provided by
the Financing, together with Parents cash on hand (as of the date hereof and
as of the Effective Time), are sufficient to fully fund all of Parents and
Subs obligations under this Agreement, including payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and Performance Award
Consideration and payment of all fees and expenses related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any refinancing of indebtedness of Parent
or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries in connection therewith.
Except as set forth in the Financing Commitments, there are no conditions
precedent to the respective obligations of the Lenders to fund the Debt
Financing or of the Investors to fund the Equity Financing. There are no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements that would permit the Lenders
to reduce the amount of the Debt Financing, that would permit the Investors to
reduce the amount of the Equity Financing or that could otherwise affect the
availability of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing. The Equity
Commitment Letter has been duly executed and delivered by, and is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of, Parent and the Investor or Investors party
thereto, and each of the Debt Commitment Letters has been duly executed and
delivered by, and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of, Parent and all
other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, each of the Financing
Commitments is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. All commitment and
other fees required to be paid under the Financing Commitments on or prior to
the date hereof have been paid and, as of the date hereof, to the knowledge of
Parent, there is no fact or occurrence existing that would make any of the
statements (including assumptions) set forth in any of the Financing
Commitments inaccurate. Assuming no breach or default by the Company under
this Agreement, there is no fact or occurrence known to Parent or Sub as of
the date of this Agreement that would cause the conditions to funding of the
 



 

33  Financing not to be satisfied at or before the Effective Time, and neither
Parent nor Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained
in the Financing Commitments.

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby), (i) none of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries will have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay
such debts as they mature or become due, the then present fair salable value
of the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries will exceed the amount that will be required to pay its
respective probable liabilities (including the probable amount of all
contingent liabilities) and its respective debts as they become absolute and
matured, (ii) the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case at a fair valuation, will exceed its respective
debts (including the probable amount of all contingent liabilities) and (iii)
none of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries will have
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business as presently conducted or
as proposed to be conducted. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Parent, Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

Section 5.11 _Share Ownership_. None of Parent, Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates beneficially owns any Common Stock.

Section 5.12  _Interested Stockholder_. Prior to the Board of Directors of
the Company approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
none of Parent, Sub or their respective Affiliates was at any time an
"interested stockholder" (as defined in section 203 of the DGCL) with respect
to the Company.

Section 5.13 _Absences of Arrangements with Management_. Other than this
Agreement and as set forth on _Section 5.13_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts,
undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings
between Parent or Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
member of the Companys management or board of directors, on the other hand,
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations
of the Company after the Effective Time.

Section 5.14 _Investigation by Parent and Sub_. Each of Parent and Sub has
conducted its own independent review and analysis of the businesses, assets,
condition, operations and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
acknowledges that each of Parent and Sub has been provided access to the
properties, premises and records (including via an electronic data room) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for this purpose. In entering into this
Agreement, each of Parent and Sub has relied solely upon its own investigation
and analysis, and each of Parent and Sub acknowledges that, except for the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article
IV_ , none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their  



 

34  respective Representatives makes any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to Parent or Sub or any of their
Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the
Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives or any
other Person has made a representation or warranty to Parent or Sub with
respect to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets for the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (b) any material, documents or information relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries made available to each of Parent or Sub or their
Representatives in the electronic data room, confidential information
memorandum or otherwise, except as expressly and specifically covered by a
representation or warranty set forth in  _Article IV_.

Section 5.15 _WTO Investor Status_. Each of Parent and Sub is a "WTO investor"
as defined in the ICA.

Person is reasonably likely to submit to the Company an Acquisition Proposal
that is a Superior Proposal. In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations with regard to any
Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law.

(d) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Time, the Company will promptly
(and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent of the receipt by the Company
of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms of
and identity of the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal. From and
after the No-Shop Period Start Time, the Company will keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any
material amendments or  



 

39  proposed material amendments thereto and will promptly notify Parent of any
determination by the Companys board of directors that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

(e) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Time, the board of directors of
the Company shall not (i) approve, endorse or recommend a Superior Proposal
or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or
(ii) modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent or withdraw the Company
Recommendation ((i) or (ii) above being referred to as an " _Change in
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the board of directors of
the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,
make a Change in Recommendation if (i) the board of directors of the Company
determines, in good faith (after consultation with its counsel), that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) in response to a
Superior Proposal.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
from and after the No-Shop Period Start Time, the Company may not make a
Change in Recommendation unless (i) it notifies Parent in writing of its
intention to take such action at least three (3) Business Days prior to
taking such action, specifying the material terms of any applicable Superior
Proposal and identifying the Person(s) making such Superior Proposal, and (ii)
with respect to clause (i) of the definition of "Change in Recommendation,"
Parent does not make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to
negotiate with the Company and its Representatives, within such three (3)
Business Day period, an offer that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its counsel and
financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as
such Superior Proposal.

Section 6.4 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent agrees
to provide compensation and employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and
policies (including severance, bonus and incentive plans, programs and
arrangements but not including any Company Equity Plans or any other equity-
based agreements, plans or arrangements) for the benefit of employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who are not represented by a union or
labor organization (the " _Non-Union Employees_ ") that in the aggregate are
no less favorable to such employees than the compensation arrangements and the
Benefit Plans in place at the date of this Agreement and as they may be
amended consistent with this Agreement. With respect to each benefit plan,
program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time adopted in replacement of any
Benefit Plan and in which Non-Union Employees participate (the " _Parent
Plans_ "), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of pension benefits) service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries as constituted at the Effective Time (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Parent; _provided_ _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of  



 

40  benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods or evidence of insurability requirements. Each Parent Plan
shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not
applicable under the applicable Benefit Plan. Non-Union Employees shall be
given credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the
Effective Time during the year in which the Effective Time occurs under a
corresponding Benefit Plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.4(a)_, nothing herein
shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Benefit Plan or interfere
with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make changes to any
Benefit Plan in accordance with the terms of the Benefit Plan.

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to
honor (promptly and without modification) in accordance with their terms those
incentive, bonus, individual benefit, employment, employment termination,
severance and other compensation agreements, plans and arrangements, including
the Companys change in control, general severance and retention plans,
indemnification agreements with the Companys directors and
officers, director compensation plans, deferral arrangements and split-dollar
life insurance policies and any "rabbi trust" or similar plan, in each case
existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and which are
set forth in  _Section 4.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the " _CIC Plans_ "), but not including any Company Equity
Plans or other equity-based agreements, plans or arrangements, other than the
Director Compensation Plans cash and cash deferred account components (it
being understood that the references to "CIC Plans" below in this _Section
6.4(b)_ only shall not include the Company Equity Plans or other equity-based
agreements, plans or arrangements, other than the Director Compensation
Plans cash and cash deferred account components). Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to not, terminate the CIC Plans or amend them
in any manner without the consent of the affected officer, director or
employee, except as may be otherwise authorized by any such CIC Plan for the
purpose of complying with applicable Law, including Section 409A of the Code,
for a period of one (1) year immediately following the Effective Time (or
such longer period as may be provided under each respective CIC Plan). Parent
hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of
such obligations assumed by Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section
6.4(b)_. Within one (1) business day of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall make, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make, the
contribution to the Amended and Restated Ryerson Change in Control Severance
Trust set forth on _Section 6.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of
this _Section 6.4(b)_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Non-Union Employee.

(c) With respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are
represented by a union or labor organization (the " _Union Employees_ "),
Parent agrees to assume and honor or cause to be assumed and honored all CBAs
listed on _Section 4.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
any successor  



 

41  agreements thereto and provide such Union Employees with compensation and
benefits as set forth in the CBAs and any successor agreements thereto.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_, other than _Section 6.4(b)_, are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and no current or
former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependant thereof) or any other person shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and nothing herein
shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan or Parent Plan for any
purpose.

Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any
of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make
any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other
party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue
such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any
such public announcements; _provided_ , that the Company will no longer be
required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent in connection
with any such press release or public announcement if the Companys board of
directors has effected any Change in Recommendation or shall have resolved to
do so.

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were
directors or officers of the Company or any of its present or former
Subsidiaries or corporate parents (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by Law. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Company on the date of this Agreement,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Companys  



 

42  Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any other employees, agents or
other individuals otherwise covered by such insurance policies prior to
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") with respect to
matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially the
same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the Insured Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained
pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. Alternatively, at Parents option,
Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase at or after the
Effective Time, or at the Companys option, the Company may purchase prior to
the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the transactions contemplated hereby. If such "tail" prepaid policy has
been obtained, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

(c) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.6_.

(d) This _Section 6.6_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby
guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the
indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ and the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Proxy Statement_.

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") as soon as
practicable following  



 

43  the date hereof and in no event later than 40 days (or such other date on
which the parties may agree in writing) after the date on which all SEC
comments to the Proxy Statement have been resolved, for the purpose of
considering the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger. In
connection with the Company Special Meeting, as soon as practicable following
the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement and furnish the
information required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the DGCL and any other applicable Laws. The Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
(which comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company). The Company
will advise Parent promptly of any comments on the Proxy Statement by the SEC
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments
with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof. The Company shall consult with Parent and reasonably consider its
comments prior to responding to SEC comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement
shall include the Company Recommendation and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote; _provided_ ,
_however_ that if the Companys board of directors effects a Change in
Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.3(e), the Company may cease to use
such efforts. A Change in Recommendation permitted by Section 6.3(e) will not
constitute a breach by the Company of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the
Company, regardless of whether the board of directors has approved endorsed or
recommended an Acquisition Proposal or has effected a Change in
Recommendation, but in compliance with the DGCL, will call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Special Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof and will submit this Agreement for adoption by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Special Meeting. Unless
required by applicable Law, the Company shall not postpone the Company
Special Meeting, or adjourn the Company Special Meeting if a quorum is
present, without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 6.8 [ _Reserved_ ]

Section 6.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) take, or to cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Entities and any third parties any actions, non-actions,
clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or orders required to be
obtained by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii)
make all registrations, filings, notifications or submissions  



 

44  which are necessary or advisable, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A)
any applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and any
applicable competition, antitrust or investment Laws of jurisdictions other
than the United States, and (C) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of
all such filings and attachments to outside counsel for the non-filing party
and including the timing of the initial filings, which will be made under the
HSR Act within ten days after the date of this Agreement and under any
applicable competition, antitrust or investment Laws of jurisdictions other
than the United States as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement; (iv) furnish all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) keep the other party
informed in all material respects of any material communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (vi) permit the other parties to review any material
communication delivered to, and consulting with the other party in advance of
any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with any
proceeding by a private party relating thereto, and giving the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences (to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or private party); (vii)
avoid the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or
judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (viii) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No parties to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary
delay of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the
consent of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Without limiting this _Section 6.9_, Parent agrees to
take, or to cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make any and all
undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, merger control, competition, or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event,
no later than the Termination Date), including proposing, negotiating,
committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company or otherwise taking
or committing to take actions that limit Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom
of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company, in
each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or delaying the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts or take any action pursuant to
this _Section 6.9_ if in the  



 

45  opinion of its board of directors after consultation with its counsel such
actions would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to
the Companys shareholders under, or otherwise violate, applicable Law.

Section 6.10 _Financing_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that Parents and Subs obligations
hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon Parents or Subs obtaining
any financing. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Sub
acknowledge and agree that the existence of any conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments or the Financing shall not constitute, nor be construed
to constitute, a condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments,
(ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, which agreements shall be
in effect as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event
later than the Closing, and (iii) consummate the Financing no later than the
Closing. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, (A)
Parent shall immediately notify the Company and (B) Parent and Sub shall use
their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from
alternative sources, on terms that are no more adverse to the Company, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, including
entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive
agreements entered into pursuant to the first or second sentence of this
_Section 6.10(b)_ being referred to as the " _Financing Agreements_ ").
Parent and Sub shall, shall cause their Affiliates to, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to, comply with the
terms, and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions, of the Financing
Commitments, any alternative financing commitments, the Financing Agreements
and any related fee and engagement letters. Any material breach of the
Financing Commitments, the Financing Agreements, any alternative financing
commitment and any related fee and engagement letter by Parent or Sub shall be
deemed a breach by Parent and Sub of this _Section 6.10(b)_. Parent shall (x)
furnish to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing
Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give the Company prompt notice
of any breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitments, any
alternative financing commitment or the Financing Agreements of which Parent
or Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of Parents and Subs efforts to
arrange the Financing.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at
Parents sole expense, reasonably cooperate in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). Such cooperation
by the Company and its Subsidiaries shall include, at the reasonable request
of Parent, (i) using its reasonable best efforts to cause  



 

46  to be delivered such officers certificates as are customary in financings
of such type and as are, in the good faith determination of the
persons executing such officers certificates, accurate, (ii) agreeing to
enter into such agreements as are customary in financings of such type,
including lock-box, blocked account and similar agreements, and agreeing to
pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise grant liens on, the
Companys or its Subsidiaries assets pursuant to such agreements, as may be
reasonably requested, _provided_ that no obligation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries under any such agreement, pledge or grant contemplated by this
clause (ii) shall be effective until the Effective Time, (iii) using its
reasonable best efforts to cause its independent registered public accountants
to deliver such comfort letters as are customary in financings of such type,
(iv) providing financial and other information in the Companys or its
Subsidiaries possession (including financial statements and monthly financial
reports of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in the ordinary course
of business) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (v) making the
Companys or Subsidiaries executive officers reasonably available to assist
the lenders providing the Debt Financing, including customary and reasonable
participation in road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating
agencies, assisting Parent and such lenders in developing financial
projections and pro forma financial statements, and otherwise reasonably
cooperating in connection with the consummation of the Financing, (vi)
permitting the lenders providing the Debt Financing to conduct field audits
and facility visits as part of their evaluation of the Companys assets,
cash management and accounting systems and their policies and procedures
relating thereto, and (vii) assisting Parent and Merger Sub with their
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents required in connection with the Financing, and (viii)
providing reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with any
proposed tender offer and consent solicitation with respect to outstanding
debt securities. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur
any other liability or obligation or authorize any of corporate action in
connection with the Financing (or any replacements thereof) prior to
the Effective Time.

(d) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Company and its
Affiliates and employees of the Company and its Affiliates have no
responsibility for any financing that Parent or Sub may raise in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. Any rating agency presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents prepared by or on behalf of Parent or Sub
or any of their Affiliates, or Parents or Subs financing sources, in
connection with Parents or Subs financing activities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, " _Offering Materials_ ")
which include any information provided by or on behalf of the Company and its
Affiliates shall include a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect that the
Company and its Affiliates and employees of the Company and its Affiliates
have no responsibility for the content of such Offering Materials and disclaim
all responsibility therefor and shall further include a disclaimer with
respect to the Company and its  



 

47  Affiliates and employees of the Company and its Affiliates in any oral
disclosure with respect to such financing activities.

Section 6.11 _Sub and Surviving Corporation_. Parent will take all actions
necessary to (a) cause Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform promptly
their respective obligations under this Agreement and the Financing
Commitments, (b) cause Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Sub shall not conduct any business, make any investments or
incur or guarantee any indebtedness.

Section 6.12 _Convertible Notes_. At least 10 days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall send notice of the Merger to the holders of its Convertible
Notes outstanding at such time in accordance with the terms of the Convertible
Notes Indenture. At least two Business Days prior to the fifteenth day prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall place on its website or publicly
announce the proposed Merger in accordance with the terms of the Convertible
Notes Indenture.

Section 6.13 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Unless the Company shall have advised
Parent in writing that it is a "United States real property interest" within
the meaning of Section 897 of the Code, at the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a certificate that an interest in the Company is not a
"United States real property interest" within the meaning of Section 897 of
the Code.

(the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to

determination is the Closing Date); _provided_ that if such breach is curable
by Parent and Sub within thirty (30) days through  



 

50  the exercise of their reasonable best efforts during such thirty (30) day
period and Parent and Sub continue to exercise such reasonable best
efforts, the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section

determination is the Closing Date); _provided_ that if such breach is curable
by the Company within thirty (30) days through the exercise of its reasonable
best efforts during such thirty (30) day period and the Company continues to
exercise such reasonable best efforts, Parent may not terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_ unless such breach is not cured
within such thirty (30) day period; _provided_ , _further_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void,
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or
their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Representatives, agents or advisors other than, with respect to Parent, Sub
and the Company, the obligations pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, _Article IX_
and the last sentence of _Section 6.2_ and _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the  



 

51  contrary contained in this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination in accordance
with their respective terms. Nothing contained in this _Section 8.2_ shall
relieve Parent, Sub or the Company from liability for fraud or willful breach
of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_, (ii) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(iv)_, (iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or (iv) either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, and in the case of
this clause (iv) only, (A) there has been publicly disclosed for the first
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time of the Company
Special Meeting an Acquisition Proposal which is not withdrawn prior to the
time of the Company Special Meeting and (B) within six (6) months after such
termination, either (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a transaction pursuant to such Acquisition Proposal, which
transaction is later consummated with the Person that made such Acquisition
Proposal, or (2) a transaction included within the definition of an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated with such Person, then, in any of the
cases described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), the Company shall
pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee as follows: (A) concurrently with
any termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or
any termination by the Company pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_, and (B)
within five (5) Business Days after the consummation of the transaction
contemplated in subclause (C) of the foregoing clause (iv) or any termination
by Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_; it being understood that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion; _provided_ , _that_ , solely for the purposes of this 
_Section 8.2(b)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning
ascribed thereto in _Section 1.1_, except that all references in such
definition to 25% shall be changed to 51%. If this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Expenses within five (5) Business Day after such
termination; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Expenses on more than one occasion, including
as part of any Company Termination Fee payable hereunder. Upon payment of the
Company Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent
or Sub with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The payment contemplated by this _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes. In the event that
the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due, the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by Parent (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit)
taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such
unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the
date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.



 

52 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ (and as of the Termination Date the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than _Section 7.2(c)_) were
satisfied), _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or  _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then Parent shall
pay to the Company a termination fee of $25 million in cash (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") within two (2) Business Days of such termination; it being
understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The payment contemplated by this
_Section 8.2(c)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Company. In the event that Parent shall
fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, Parent shall reimburse the
Company for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by
the Company (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection
with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment
of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime
lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall
Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were
required to be paid to the date of actual payment.

refusal to accept notice hereunder or the inability of another party to

of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver. Nothing in this section
shall be deemed to constitute consent to the manner or address for service of
process in connection with any legal proceeding, including litigation arising

Section 9.4 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or
information in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be adequate response and disclosure of such fact, circumstance or
information with respect to any representation, warranty or covenant in any
section of _Article IV_ or _Article VI_ calling for disclosure of such fact,
circumstance or information to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure that is relevant to such other representation, warrant
or covenant, whether or not such disclosure is specifically associated with or
purports to respond to one or more or all of such representations, warranties
or covenants. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of materiality of such
item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose
whatsoever. 

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement.

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits hereto, together
with the other instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Equity Commitment Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b), except
as provided in _Article III_ on and after the Effective Time and _Section
6.4(b)_ and _Section 6.6_, are not intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, but without limiting the right of the
Company to receive the Parent Termination Fee and the related costs, expenses
and interest to the extent provided in _Section 8.2(c)_ or the Equity
Commitment Letter, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Sub and the
Investors to the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under
any theory shall in no event exceed the Parent Termination Fee and the related
costs, expenses and interest to the extent provided in  _Section 8.2(c)_ or
the Equity Commitment Letter, and upon payment of such amounts the Company
shall not, directly or indirectly, recover or seek to recover under any theory
any amount in excess of such aggregate amount from Parent, Sub and the
Investors relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (it being understood and agreed that the obligations of
each Investor are limited to the obligations of such Investor
expressly provided in the Equity Commitment Letter), provided, however that
nothing  



 

55  herein shall relieve Parent or Sub of liability to pay the Merger
Consideration, Option Consideration, Performance Award Consideration and all
fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in the event the Merger occurs.

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to
be made and performed entirely therein without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly
and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any Federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than a Federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware and
(d) each of the parties hereto agrees that each of the other parties shall
have the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a
judgment entered by any Federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
Delaware state court in any other court or jurisdiction.

Section 9.10 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
courts referred to in _Section 9.9_ hereof in any such action or proceeding
by mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to 
_Section 9.3_ hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a
party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally
available method.

Section 9.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Parent and/or Sub may assign all or
any of their rights and obligations hereunder as collateral to any financing
source or to any Affiliate of Parent after providing written notice thereof
to the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve
the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns.



 

56 Section 9.12 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby is consummated.

Section 9.13 _Headings_. Headings of the articles and sections of this
Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are
for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

Section 9.14 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
expressly granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.
