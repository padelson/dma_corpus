the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall

Section 2.2Closing.

 

(a)The closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New
York 10017, at 9:00 a.m., New York time, on October 1, 2018; provided, that if
the conditions precedent set forth in Article VII have not been satisfied or
waived in accordance with this Agreement (subject to Section 2.2(b)) as of the
third (3rd) Business Day prior to October 1, 2018 (other than those conditions
that by their nature only may be satisfied by actions to be taken at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such
time), the Closing shall take place on the day that is the third (3rd)
Business Day after the date on which the conditions precedent set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature only may be
satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the

2.2(b)) have been satisfied or waived (subject to Section 2.2(b)) in

other date as the parties hereto may mutually agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing

that would render the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) not to be
satisfied following the Satisfaction Date; provided, that, for the avoidance
of doubt, the foregoing clause (ii) shall not prevent Purchaser's right to
claim, prior to Closing, that the Satisfaction Date did not occur to the

parties agree that for all purposes the Closing shall be deemed effective as
of the Adjustment Time.

 

Section 2.4Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects provided

property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger

interests of the Company in the Merger, as a merger of the Company and
Purchaser, with Purchaser as an "assets-over form" merger under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(3), provided that the portion of the Company
interests that are acquired for consideration other than Purchaser Units shall
be treated as acquired through a sale of the Company interests in accordance

such Allocation shall become binding on the parties. Any disputes under this
Section 2.7 that cannot be resolved through good faith negotiation shall be
referred to the Independent Accountant, whose determination shall be final and
binding upon the parties. The cost of the Independent Accountant's review and
determination shall be borne in accordance with the principles of Section
3.4(e). The Securityholder Representative and Purchaser shall report
consistently with the Intended Tax Treatment and the Allocation on all Tax
Returns, and neither the Securityholder Representative nor Purchaser shall
take any position in any return that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment or the Allocation, as finally determined in accordance with this
Agreement, in each case, unless required to do so by a final determination as
defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

 

Section 2.8Withholding. Purchaser, the Company, the Paying Agent and the
Escrow Agent and each of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold (without duplication) from any and all payments made under
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
under applicable Laws; provided that before making any deduction or
withholding pursuant to this Section 2.8 (other than with respect to
compensatory payments), Purchaser shall notify the Securityholder
Representative at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date of any such
anticipated deduction or withholding (together with any legal basis therefor),
provide the Securityholder Representative with sufficient opportunity to cause
to be provided any forms or other documentation or take such other steps in
order to avoid such deduction or withholding, and reasonably consult and
cooperate with the Securityholder Representative in good faith to attempt to
reduce or eliminate any amounts that would otherwise be deducted or withheld
pursuant to this Section 2.8. To the extent such amounts are withheld and paid
to the appropriate taxing authority in accordance with applicable Laws, such
withheld amount shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would have otherwise been paid.

the value of the number of Parent Class A Shares or Purchaser Units such
Unitholder would be entitled to receive as consideration as described in

equal to the Reference Price), which shall be payable, in each case, at the
times provided for herein.

Each Unitholder shall receive from Purchaser, the Paying Agent or the Escrow

Section 3.4Purchase Price Adjustment. 

 

(a)At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth the Company's good faith calculation of (i) the estimated amount
of Working Capital, as of the Adjustment Time (the "Estimated Working Capital
Amount"), (ii) the estimated amount of Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated
Closing Indebtedness"), (iii) the estimated amount of Closing Cash, as of the
Adjustment Time (the "Estimated Cash") and (iv) the estimated amount of
Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses"), in each case
based on the Company's books and records and other information available at
the time. From the Adjustment Time to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not take any actions that would result in any changes to the Estimated Closing
Statement other than as expressly required by applicable Law or this
Agreement.

 

(b)Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
the Securityholder Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement")
setting forth Purchaser's good faith calculation of the amount, as of the
Adjustment Time, of Working Capital and Closing Cash, and the amount of
Closing Indebtedness, in each case with reasonable supporting detail of each
of the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement.

   

(c)During the thirty (30) days immediately following the Securityholder
Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement (the "Review Period"), the
Securityholder Representative and its Representatives shall be permitted to
review the books and records of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries and
the working papers of Purchaser, the Surviving Entity and their independent
accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement and
the calculation of the Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses therein, and shall be provided with reasonable access,
during normal business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations of Purchaser or the Surviving Entity, to the
current and former personnel and advisors of Purchaser and the Surviving
Entity who were involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement in order
to ask questions and receive answers related to the Closing Statement and the
preparation thereof; provided, however, that the independent accountants of
Purchaser or the Surviving Entity shall not be obligated to make any working
papers available to the Securityholder Representative unless and until the
Securityholder Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries not to,
take any action to limit the Securityholder Representative's reasonable access
to the books and records of, and the current and former personnel and advisors
of, Purchaser, the Surviving Entity and their Subsidiaries. The Securityholder
Representative shall notify Purchaser in writing (the "Notice of
Disagreement") prior to the expiration of the Review Period if the
Securityholder Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement or the
Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness set forth therein. The
Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement, the amounts involved and the Securityholder Representative's
determination of the amount, as of the Adjustment Time, of the Working Capital
and Closing Cash, and the amount of Closing Indebtedness, in each case with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation.

 

(d)During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, the Securityholder Representative and Purchaser shall seek in
good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If no Notice of Disagreement
is received by Purchaser on or prior to the expiration date of the Review
Period, then the Closing Statement and the Working Capital, Closing Cash and
Closing Indebtedness set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to
have been accepted by the Securityholder Representative and shall become final
and binding upon Purchaser and the Unitholders. If the parties cannot agree
on the Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness within such
thirty (30) day period, the Working Capital, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Indebtedness, in each case solely to the extent not agreed between the
Securityholder Representative and Purchaser, shall be determined by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "Independent Accountant"). The Securityholder
Representative and Purchaser shall each enter into a customary engagement
letter with the Independent Accountant. The Securityholder Representative and
Purchaser shall furnish the Independent Accountant with a statement setting
forth the items from the Notice of Disagreement which are still in dispute
(the "Independent Accountant Dispute Notice"). In the event that
PricewaterhouseCoopers refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the
Independent Accountant, the Securityholder Representative and Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent certified public accounting
firm in the United States of national recognition mutually agreeable to the
Securityholder Representative

   

and Purchaser, in which event "Independent Accountant" shall mean such firm.
Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such matters to the
Independent Accountant, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent
Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator, will, applying those
policies and procedures set forth on Annex A, based on information known or
knowable as of the Closing Date, and otherwise in a manner consistent with the
basis upon which the Sample Calculations were made, make a determination in
writing of the appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Closing
Statement as to which there is disagreement as specified in the Independent
Accountant Dispute Notice, which determination shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Securityholder Representative, the Surviving Entity and
Purchaser, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error. With respect to each
disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position
of either the Securityholder Representative or Purchaser, shall not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the
Securityholder Representative or Purchaser in the Independent Accountant
Dispute Notice with respect to such disputed line item (and Purchaser shall
not advocate any positions more adverse to the Unitholders than the amounts
reflected in the Closing Statement). For the avoidance of doubt, the
Independent Accountant shall not review any line items or make any
determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the
Independent Accountant Dispute Notice that are in dispute. The statement of
the amount, as of the Adjustment Time, of Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, and the determination of the
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses
therefrom that are final and binding on the Securityholder Representative and
Purchaser, as determined either through agreement by the Securityholder
Representative and Purchaser (deemed or otherwise) or through the
determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this Section 3.4(d) is
referred to herein as the "Final Working Capital Amount", "Final Closing
Cash", "Final Closing Indebtedness" and "Final Transaction Expenses",
respectively, and the Estimated Closing Consideration, Estimated Aggregate
Cash Amount, and Estimated Aggregate Equity Amount derived therefrom are
referred to herein as the "Final Closing Consideration", "Final Aggregate Cash
Amount" and "Final Aggregate Equity Amount", respectively. During the review
by the Independent Accountant, (i) neither Purchaser or the Securityholder
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall
have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Independent Accountant
and (ii) the Securityholder Representative and Purchaser shall each make
reasonably available to the Independent Accountant such individuals and such
information, books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by
the Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations under this Section
3.4(d); provided, however, that the independent accountants of the
Securityholder Representative or Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the Independent Accountant unless and until the
Independent Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

 

(e)The cost of the Independent Accountant's review and determination shall be
borne on a proportionate basis by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Unitholders, on the other (whose share shall be paid on their behalf by the
Securityholder Representative from the Securityholder Representative Funds),
based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded
in favor of each such Person bears to the amount actually contested by such
Person. By way of illustration, if Purchaser's calculations would have
resulted

   

in a $1,000,000 net payment to Purchaser, and the Securityholder
Representative's calculations would have resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment
to the Unitholders, and the Independent Accountant's final determination as
adopted pursuant to Section 3.4(d) results in an aggregate net payment of
$500,000 to the Unitholders, then Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Unitholders (whose share shall be paid on their behalf by the Securityholder
Representative from the Escrow), on the other, shall pay 75% and 25%,
respectively, of such fees and expenses.

 

(f)The "Final Closing Consideration" shall be calculated by recalculating the
Estimated Closing Consideration using the Final Working Capital Amount in lieu
of the Estimated Working Capital Amount, using Final Closing Cash in lieu of
Estimated Cash, using Final Closing Indebtedness in lieu of Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, using Final Transaction Expenses in lieu of Estimated
Transaction Expenses, using Final Closing Consideration in lieu of Estimated
Closing Consideration, using Final Aggregate Cash Amount in lieu of Estimated
Aggregate Cash Amount, and using Final Aggregate Equity Amount in lieu of
Estimated Aggregate Equity Amount, and otherwise using the components of
Estimated Closing Consideration as set forth in the definition of Estimated
Closing Consideration. If the Final Closing Consideration is less than the
Estimated Closing Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the
"Deficiency Amount"), Purchaser shall be paid and have deposited promptly (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Final Working Capital
Amount, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Transaction
Expenses have been agreed upon or determined by the Independent Accountant),
by wire transfer from the Escrow Account, an amount in cash equal to the
Deficiency Amount; provided, however, in no event shall any Unitholder have
personal liability for payment of such amount or any portion thereof, and
Purchaser's sole recourse with respect thereto shall be the Escrow held by the
Escrow Agent. If the Final Closing Consideration is greater than the
Estimated Closing Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the "Excess
Amount"), Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days after the Final Working Capital Amount, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing
Indebtedness and Final Transaction Expenses have been agreed upon or
determined by the Independent Accountant) pay and deliver, or cause to be paid
and delivered, to and deposit with the Paying Agent, on behalf of and as agent
of the Unitholders, an amount equal to the Excess Amount, which, together with
any Remaining Amount, shall be payable in the form of consideration specified
with respect to each Unitholder in Section 3.2(a)(iv). If any Escrow remains
in the Escrow Account after the payment of the Deficiency Amount or Excess
Amount, as the case may be (which shall be the entirety of the Escrow in the
case of a payment of the Excess Amount) (such amount, the "Remaining Amount"),
then (a) the portion of the Remaining Amount payable to Unitholders in cash in
accordance with Section 3.2(a)(iv) shall be released to the Paying Agent (on
behalf of and as agent for the Unitholders) by wire transfer from the Escrow
Account, and (b) Purchaser shall, for the benefit of the Unitholders, issue
and deposit with the Paying Agent, for delivery to each such Unitholder
certificates or evidence of book-entry shares or limited partnership units, as
the case may be, representing whole Parent Class A Shares or Purchaser Units
issuable pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(ii)(A) and in accordance with Section
3.2(a)(iv), and upon deposit thereof, Purchaser shall be entitled to return of
an amount of cash equal to the value of the securities so deposited (as
determined in accordance with Section 3.2(a)(iii)). Purchaser and the
Securityholder Representative hereby agree to deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent (i) within (5) Business Days after the Final
Working Capital Amount, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Indebtedness and
Final Transaction Expenses have been agreed upon or determined by the
Independent Accountant to deliver

   

promptly from the Escrow Account all funds to be delivered in accordance with
this Section 3.4(f) and (ii) within five (5) Business Days after Purchaser
shall have made the issuance and deposit with the Paying Agent referred to in
clause (b) above, to deliver promptly from the Escrow Account to Purchaser an
amount in cash equal to the value (as determined pursuant to Section
3.2(a)(iii)) of the securities so deposited by Purchaser.

 

(g)Each of the Estimated Closing Statement (including the Estimated Working
Capital Amount, Estimated Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated
Transaction Expenses) and the Closing Statement (including the Final Working
Capital, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Indebtedness and Final Transaction
Expenses) shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with the definitions
of such terms contained in the Agreement and Annex A and, except that the
Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement (and all calculations
set forth in each) shall: (i) not include any purchase accounting or other
adjustment arising out of the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) be based
on facts and circumstances as they exist up to the Closing (or at the
Adjustment Time, as applicable) and shall exclude the effect of any act,
decision or event occurring after the Closing; (iii) include the same line
items (and only those line items) set forth in the Sample Calculations; and
(iv) utilize those policies and procedures set forth on Annex A.

 

Section 3.5Escrow. At the Closing, Purchaser shall, on behalf of the
Unitholders, deliver to Citibank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"), as agent to
Purchaser and the Unitholders, the Escrow in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.2(b)(i)(2), which Escrow shall be held by the Escrow Agent in an
escrow account (the "Escrow Account") in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
and used for the purposes of any payments payable to Purchaser or the
Unitholders pursuant to Section 3.4.

 

Section 3.6Securityholder Representative Account. If any Securityholder
Representative Funds remain in the Securityholder Representative Account after
payment of all Securityholder Representative Expenses (such amount, the
"Leftover Amount"), which shall be payable in the form of consideration
specified with respect to each Unitholder in Section 3.2(a)(iv), (a) then the
portion of the Leftover Amount payable to Unitholders in cash in accordance
with Section 3.2(a)(iv) shall be released to the Paying Agent (on behalf of
and as agent for the Unitholders) by wire transfer from the Securityholder
Representative Account, and (b) Purchaser shall, for the benefit of the
Unitholders, issue and deposit with the Paying Agent, for delivery to each
such Unitholder certificates or evidence of book-entry shares or limited
partnership units, as the case may be, representing whole Parent Class A
Shares or Purchaser Units issuable pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(ii)(C) and in
accordance with Section 3.2(a)(iv), and upon deposit thereof, Purchaser shall
be entitled to return of an amount of cash equal to the value of the
securities so deposited (as determined in accordance with Section
3.2(a)(iii)). Securityholder Representative hereby agrees that after Purchaser
shall have made the issuance and deposit referred to in clause (b) above, it
shall promptly release and deliver to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the
value (as determined pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(iii)) of the securities so
deposited by Purchaser.

 

Section 3.7Closing of the Company Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the
unit transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Units
shall thereafter be made.

liability company interests of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned, directly or indirectly, by Purchaser.

 

(b)Merger Sub has not conducted any business other than (i) incident to its
formation for the sole purpose of carrying out the Transactions and (ii) in
relation to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

Section 5.6SEC Reports. 

 

(a)Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished, as
applicable, all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file or furnish, as applicable, in the twelve (12) months period prior to
the date hereof with any Governmental Entity, including any report,
registration or statement required to be filed or furnished, as applicable,
pursuant to the Laws of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or
any Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, in each case, except where the failure to do
so would not have a material adverse effect on Parent and its Significant
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or have a material adverse effect on the ability
of Parent to consummate the Transactions.

 

(b)An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC since October 1, 2015 by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (together with
those forms, reports and other documents filed by Parent with the SEC
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, if any, the "Parent Reports") has
been made publicly available. No such Parent Report (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively) contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all Parent Reports filed or furnished under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. No executive
officer of Parent has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with
respect to any of the Parent Reports.

   

Section 5.7Financial Statements.

 

(a)The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) present fairly in all
material respects, as of their respective dates and for the periods set forth
therein, the financial condition, operating results and cash flows of Parent
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to the
absence of full footnote disclosures and schedules and normal year-end audit
adjustments), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP. Deloitte and
Touche LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or
been dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or
in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 

(b)Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
required by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent,
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on (i) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018 and (ii) the
audited consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, in each case of clauses
(i) and (ii) as set forth in the financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2018
or in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parent's outside
auditors and the audit committee of Parent's Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Purchaser's

   

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Purchaser's internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of
Purchaser, there is no reason to believe that Parent's outside auditors and
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since October 1, 2015, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the knowledge of Purchaser, any director, officer, employee, auditor or
accountant of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received any written
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any written material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that the accounting or auditing practices of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are improper in any material respect, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has, to the knowledge of Parent, reported
evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, material breach of
fiduciary duty or similar material violation by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors or employees to the Board
of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or any director or officer of
Parent.

 

Section 5.8Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the Latest Balance
Sheet Date, no change or event has occurred that has had or would reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.9Compliance with Applicable Laws. 

 

(a)Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub hold, and have held at all times since
October 1, 2015 (or the date of such entity's formation, whichever is later),
all Permits necessary for the lawful conduct of their businesses and ownership
of their properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except
where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and
holding such Permit (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, and, to the knowledge of Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub, no
suspension or cancellation of any such necessary Permit is threatened.

 

(b)PJT Partners LP (the "Broker-Dealer Subsidiary") is a member in good
standing of FINRA and each other Governmental Entity where the conduct of its
business requires such membership, except where the failure to be in such good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
effect on the Broker-Dealer Subsidiary. The Broker-Dealer Subsidiary currently
maintains and, at all times since October 1, 2015, has maintained "net
capital" (as such term is defined in Rule 15c3-1(c)(2) under the Exchange Act)
equal to or in excess of the minimum "net capital" required to be maintained
by it under the Exchange Act. None of the Broker-Dealer Subsidiary nor any
"associated person" thereof (i) is

   

or has been ineligible to serve as a broker-dealer or an associated person of
a broker-dealer under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, (ii) is subject to a
"statutory disqualification" as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange
Act or (iii) is subject to disqualification under Rule 506(d) of Regulation D
under the Securities Act. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Partnership, threatened, that is reasonably likely to result in any such
person being deemed ineligible as described in clause (i), subject to a
"statutory disqualification" as described in clause (ii) or subject to
disqualification as described in clause (iii).

 

(c)Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries have
since October 1, 2015 (or the date of such entity's formation, whichever is
later), (i) complied with and are not in default or violation under any
applicable Law or policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating
to each of Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries,
including (to the extent applicable to Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries) all Laws related to data protection or privacy,
the USA PATRIOT Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, (ii) been conducting operations at all times in compliance in all
material respects with Anti-Money Laundering Laws and (iii) established and
maintained a system of internal controls designed to provide compliance by
Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries with
applicable financial recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Anti-
Money Laundering Laws, except where, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii), the failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.10Legal Proceedings.

 

(a)Except as would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to
Purchaser's knowledge, threatened, Actions of any nature challenging the
validity or propriety of the Transactions.

 

(b)There is no Governmental Order imposed upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
or the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation
of the Merger, would apply to Parent or any of its Affiliates) that would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.11Financing; Parent Class A Shares and Purchaser Units. Purchaser
has, and will have at Closing, all funds necessary to pay all amounts payable
at the Closing and any other fees, expenses or other amounts payable in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and satisfy in full the
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of
Purchaser, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, including in connection
with the Transactions. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub affirms that it is
not a condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that Purchaser or Merger Sub obtain financing for or related to any
of the Transactions. Parent has, and will have at Closing or at such other
time as it is required by this Agreement, sufficient funds immediately
available and a sufficient number of Parent Class A Shares or Purchaser Units
authorized and held in reserve in order to pay and perform all of its
obligations under Section 6.17 and Section 10.19. The issuance of Parent
Class A Units and Purchaser Units to Unitholders at the Closing will be exempt
from registration or qualification under the Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Unitholders set forth in the Letter of Transmittal.

   

Section 5.12Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other
similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of any of Purchaser,
Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates.

 

Section 5.13Due Diligence by Purchaser. Purchaser acknowledges that it has
conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation of the Company and
the operations, assets, liabilities and financial condition of the Company in
making the determination to proceed with the Transactions and has relied
solely on the results of its own independent investigation and the
representations and warranties in Article IV in connection with the Company
and the subject matter of this Agreement.

(a)During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company
to provide (i) each continuing employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
other than partners or employees who are offered a new partner or employment
agreement or offer letter with Parent, with base salary or wage rate and
short-term incentive opportunity substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the base salary or wage rate and short-term incentive opportunity in effect as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) continuing employees
substantially similar employee benefits (other than equity or equity-based or
discretionary salary or bonus compensation) in the aggregate as those provided
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser.

 

(b)From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to,

obligations and responsibilities to, or in respect of, each employee and
officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each former employee and

the terms thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating

(c)For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and entitlement to benefits under the

of their respective subsidiaries in which employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing (the "Purchaser Plans"), Purchaser and the
Company shall credit each employee with his or her years of service with the
Company, its Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as
such employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Arrangement,
except under any Pension Plan or where such crediting would result in
duplication of benefits. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide that Purchaser Plans shall not deny employees coverage on the basis
of pre-existing conditions to the extent such conditions were waived or
satisfied under similar Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing
and shall credit such employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses in the applicable plan year to which such deductibles and out-of-
pocket expenses relate.

 

(d)Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to each
Senior Advisor set forth on Section 6.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and to each employee of the Company who is employed (or for such Senior
Advisors, providing services) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and who is then participating in any bonus or incentive plans, arrangements or
agreements maintained by the Company with respect to the Company's fiscal year
(or such shorter performance period) during which the Closing occurs, a
prorated incentive payment under such plans for the period from the beginning
of the applicable performance period through September 30th, 2018 based on the
performance of the Company though such date (the "September Bonus"). No later
than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
Purchaser with a list of each such employee to whom such prorated incentive
payments will be made, and the corresponding amount of each such payment. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay a prorated bonus for the remaining
portion of the fiscal year equal to one-third of the September Bonus, subject
to the employee's continued employment through the end of the fiscal year;
provided, that Senior Advisors shall not receive such prorated bonus for the
remaining portion of the fiscal year.

 

(e)Purchaser agrees to implement an incentive award program for continuing
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The award pools and types of
awards are set forth on Section 6.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

employees (each such employee a "Participant") and in such amounts as set
forth on Section 6.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to
modification by the Chief Executive Officer in consultation with the Chief
Executive Officer of Parent and with the approval of the Compensation
Committee of Parent, (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that
all such modifications must be made at least five days prior to the Closing.
At least five (5) days prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall have offered
(with the cooperation of the Company) agreements executed by Purchaser
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 6.2 (each an "Award
Agreement") to each Participant allocated an award pursuant to Section 6.2(e)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule setting forth the incentive awards such
Participant is eligible to receive pursuant to such schedule, as may be
modified as above, such agreement (to the extent executed by the Participant)
to become effective on the Closing Date and such incentive awards to be
granted by Purchaser within 20 business days following the Closing; provided,
that each such offer shall be

   

automatically withdrawn at the Effective Time if not accepted by the
applicable Participant by executing and delivering a countersigned Award
Agreement to Purchaser prior to the Closing; provided, further, that for
employees who are not receiving Restricted Shares, such Award Agreements will
include a waiver and release of all claims against the Company, Parent and
their Affiliates.

 

(f)The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.2 with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall
not create any right (i) in any other Person, including any employee, former
employee or any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company Benefit
Plan, Company Benefit Arrangement or Purchaser Plan, or (ii) to continued
employment with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Purchaser or the
Company. Except as provided in Section 6.2(d) and Section 6.2(e), after the
Effective Time, nothing contained in this Section 6.2 is intended to be or
shall be considered to be an amendment or adoption of any plan, program,
agreement, arrangement or policy of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
Purchaser or the Company nor shall it interfere with Purchaser's, the
Company's or any of the Company's Subsidiaries' right to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Arrangement or Purchaser
Plan or to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any reason.

 

Section 6.3Publicity. Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall communicate and cooperate with each
other and will mutually agree upon any press release or public disclosure of
the Transactions. Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agree on behalf of themselves and their respective
Subsidiaries that no public release or announcement concerning the terms of
the Transactions shall be issued by any of them without the prior written
consent of the other party, except such release or announcement as may be
required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which
the securities of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates are listed, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance; provided, however, that (a) the Company is permitted to report
and disclose the status and terms (including price terms) of this Agreement
and the Transactions to Corsair and to permit Corsair to disclose such status
and terms to their direct or indirect limited partners if such information is
of a nature customarily conveyed to such limited partners and disclosed in the
ordinary course of business and (b) the Company is permitted to report and
disclose the status of this Agreement and the Transactions pursuant to an
internal communication or otherwise to its employees.

 

Section 6.4Confidentiality. Purchaser and the Company each acknowledge that
the information provided to it and its Representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions are subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreements between Purchaser and CamberView Partners, LLC, dated as of
February 15, 2018 and August 14, 2018, respectively (as amended or modified
from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreements"). The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements are hereby incorporated by reference. The
Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate at the Effective Time.

   

Section 6.5Access to Information. 

 

(a)Prior to the Closing and subject to applicable Laws and Section 6.4,
Purchaser shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and
Representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants), to have such
access to the properties, businesses and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and such examination of the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written
notice in connection with Purchaser's efforts to consummate the Transactions.
Any such access and examination shall be conducted during regular business
hours and under circumstances that do not unreasonably interfere with the
normal operations of the business and shall be subject to restrictions under
applicable Law. The Company shall cause the officers, employees, consultants,
agents, accountants, attorneys and other Representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Purchaser and Purchaser's Representatives
in connection with such access and examination, and Purchaser and its
Representatives shall cooperate with the Company and its Representatives and
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to
the business. Any disclosure during such investigation by Purchaser or its
Representatives shall not constitute any enlargement or additional
representation or warranty of the Company beyond those specifically set forth
in Article IV. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access
or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it (i) relates to
information with respect to the negotiation of this Agreement and the
Transactions, (ii) would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (iii) would require the Company and its Subsidiaries
to disclose information that in the reasonable judgment of the Company after
consultation with counsel, is subject to attorney-client privilege or may
conflict with any confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound (provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
access and permit such examination in a manner that would not jeopardize such
privilege or conflict with such confidentiality obligations). 

 

(b)All Parent or Purchaser communications directly with any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the customers, suppliers, landlords, lenders and
other material business relations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with planning for the integration of the Company by Purchaser
following the Closing or otherwise in connection with the Transactions shall
be in accordance with a communications strategy mutually agreed to by the
Company and Purchaser (which will specify which persons are entitled to make
such communications) or otherwise agreed upon in writing in advance by the
Company and Purchaser, and all other communications with such parties related
to the Transactions shall be conducted in accordance with Section 6.3.
Nothing in this Section 6.5(b) shall prohibit Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates from communicating with any customer or potential customer of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in the ordinary course of business
regarding any matter unrelated to the Transactions (whether or not such Person
is also a customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

   

Section 6.6Regulatory Approvals.

 

(a)Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done as promptly
as practicable, all things necessary, proper and advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
Transactions. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each party
hereto shall furnish to the other parties such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing.

 

(b)Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another and use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary documentation (including
furnishing all information required under the Competition Laws) to effect
promptly all necessary filings with any Governmental Entity and to obtain all
consents, non-objections, waivers and approvals of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each party hereto shall provide to
the other parties copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors)
and any Governmental Antitrust Entity or other Governmental Entity relating to
the Transactions or any of the matters described in this Section 6.6 (subject
to redaction for any confidential supervisory material). Each of the parties
hereto shall promptly inform the other of any oral communication with, and
provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filings or the Transactions. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting or conference call with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or
conference call and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate. To the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another
in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party hereto relating to proceedings under the Competition Laws. The
parties hereto may, as they deem advisable, designate any competitively
sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 6.6(b) or any
other section of this Agreement as "legal counsel only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such legal counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the party providing such materials.

 

(c)Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 6.6, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to provide
or cause to be provided (including by their "ultimate parent entities" as that
term is defined in the HSR Act) as promptly as practicable to any Governmental
Antitrust Entity information and documents requested by such Governmental
Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the Transactions, including filing any notification and report form and
related material required under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, and
thereafter to respond promptly to any request for additional information or
documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act and any similar
Competition Law regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose of
competition reviews. Purchaser shall cause (and shall cause its "ultimate
parent entity" as that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause) the filings
made by it under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early
termination," and make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be
necessary, proper, or advisable in connection therewith.

   

(d)If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any
applicable Law or if any Action is instituted by any Governmental Entity or
any private party challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any
applicable Law, each of the parties hereto shall, at the sole cost and expense
of Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against
any action to prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the
Transactions), and/or (ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to
overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin
consummation of this Agreement (and the Transactions), including by defending
any Action brought by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary,
in order to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental
Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such applicable
Law so as to permit consummation of the Transactions.

 

(e)Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate in
good faith with any Governmental Entity and take promptly any and all action
required to complete lawfully the Transactions as soon as practicable (but in
any event prior to the Outside Date) and any and all action necessary or
advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened
commencement of any Action in any forum by or on behalf of any Governmental
Entity or the issuance of any Governmental Order that would (or to obtain the
agreement or consent of any Governmental Entity to the Transactions the
absence of which would) delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit
the consummation of Transactions, including (i) proffering and consenting
and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement providing for (A)
the licensing or other limitations or restrictions on, particular assets, or
categories of assets of the Surviving Entity, its Subsidiaries or Purchaser or
(B) the amendment or assignment of existing relationships and contractual
rights and obligations of the Surviving Entity, its Subsidiaries or Purchaser
and (ii) promptly effecting the licensing or holding separate of assets or
lines of business or the amendment or assignment of existing relationships and
contractual rights, in each case, at such time as may be necessary to permit
the lawful consummation of the Transactions on or prior to the Outside Date.

 

Section 6.7Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification.

 

(a)Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Arrangement, Purchaser agrees that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the
Company now existing in favor of each present (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) and former officer, director, manager or Unitholder of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Individuals") for such
Indemnified Individual's acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Individual is or was an officer, director, manager or Unitholder of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in the LLC Agreement as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other indemnification
agreements identified on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
effect on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Indemnification
Contracts"), shall survive the Merger from the Effective Time through the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs. Each
of Purchaser and the Surviving Entity shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Individual from and against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and

   

disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Individual
is or was an officer, director, manager, Unitholder, agent, employee or
fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the
Transactions and the other actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent
the Company or its Subsidiaries would have been required to indemnify such
Indemnified Individuals under applicable Law or as explicitly provided in the
LLC Agreement and the Indemnification Contracts, and in accordance with any
procedures set forth in the LLC Agreement and the Indemnification Contracts.

 

(b)Subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law,
the limited liability company agreement or other organizational agreements of
the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries (or equivalent governing documents)
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors,
managers and officers than are set forth in the LLC Agreement (or equivalent
governing documents) as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any such individuals.

 

(c)Purchaser shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous than the current
policies of directors', managers' and officers' liability insurance maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time.
Purchaser agrees to take all necessary actions to maintain such policy in full
force and effect and fulfill Purchaser's obligations thereunder throughout
such six (6) year period following the Effective Time.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.7, Purchaser
agrees that any indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance
available to any Indemnified Individual who at or prior to the Closing was a
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by virtue of such
Indemnified Individual's service as a partner, member or employee of any
investment fund or management entity affiliated with or managed by Corsair at
or prior to the Closing (any such Indemnified Individual, a "Corsair
Director") shall be secondary to the indemnification, advancement of expenses
and insurance to be provided by Purchaser, the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.7 and that the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries (i) shall be the primary indemnitors of first resort for
Corsair Directors pursuant to this Section 6.7, (ii) shall be fully
responsible for the advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities with respect to Corsair Directors that are addressed by this
Section 6.7 and (iii) shall not make any claim for contribution, subrogation
or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any other indemnification or
insurance available to any Corsair Director with respect to any matter
addressed by this Section 6.7.

   

(e)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Individual on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
6.7 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(f)This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Individual is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

(g)In the event that the Surviving Entity or Purchaser or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and permitted
assigns of the Surviving Entity or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

Section 6.8Reasonable Best Efforts. 

 

(a)Without limiting the parties' obligations under Section 6.6, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done
and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of any of the parties; (ii) the obtaining of applicable consents, waivers or
approvals of any Governmental Entities or third parties; (iii) the defending
of any Actions challenging this Agreement or the performance of the
obligations hereby; and (iv) the execution and delivery of such instruments,
and the taking of such other actions, as the other party may reasonably
require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein
shall obligate or be construed to obligate the Company or any of its
Affiliates to (i) make, or to cause to be made, any payment to any third party
in order to obtain the consent or approval of such third party for any reason
or (ii) agree to take any action or to agree to any restriction that is not
conditioned on the prior consummation of the Closing or would otherwise be
effective prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that the Company and its
Affiliates shall not have any liability whatsoever to Purchaser or Merger Sub
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent, approval or
waiver under any contract or from any other Person and no representation,
warranty or covenant herein shall be breached or deemed breached, no condition
shall be deemed not satisfied and no termination right shall be deemed
triggered as a result of such failure.

   

Section 6.9Tax Matters.

 

(a)Tax Returns.

 

(i)The Company shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due
on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any valid extension of time
to file) and timely pay all amounts shown due on such Tax Returns. Any Tax
Returns described in this Section 6.9(a)(i) (other than Pass-Through Tax
Returns) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(ii)The Securityholder Representative shall prepare and timely file or shall
cause to be prepared and timely filed all Pass-Through Tax Returns for the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing;
provided, that such Tax Returns may be prepared by the employees of the
Company or its external tax advisors at the direction of the Securityholder
Representative and that the first fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) of such
expense of preparing such Tax Returns shall be borne by Purchaser. All Tax
Returns described in this Section 6.9(a)(ii) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(iii)Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Pass-Through Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to any taxable period that begins on or before the Closing Date
and ends after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall submit all such Pass-Through
Tax Returns to the Securityholder Representative for its review and approval
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns
(taking into account any valid extension of time to file).

 

(iv)Purchaser and the Unitholders agree that in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, deductions and/or
losses of or with respect to Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses shall be
claimed in taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the
Closing Date. 

 

(b)Allocation of Taxes. The portion of any Taxes for a taxable period
beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date allocable to the
portion of such period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to equal (i)
in the case of Taxes that (x) are based upon or related to income or receipts
or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property, other than Transfer Taxes, the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended with the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of other Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis (including property Taxes), the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the period ending with the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. For
purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a taxable
period pursuant to this Section 6.9(b), the amount of any item that is taken
into account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the benefit of graduated
tax rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be allocated between the two
portions of the period in proportion to the number of days in each portion.
For purposes of this Agreement, the tax allocation principles set forth in
this Section 6.9 shall be defined as "Tax Allocation Principles".

   

(c)Cooperation in Tax Matters. The Unitholders, Securityholder Representative
and Purchaser shall cooperate reasonably in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any audit, investigation,
litigation, dispute or other similar proceeding with respect to Taxes (a "Tax
Proceeding") of the Company or any Subsidiary. Such cooperation shall include
the provision of records and information with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiary which are in the possession of any Unitholder, Securityholder
Representative or Purchaser and are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Proceeding and a power of attorney issued to the Securityholder Representative
to the extent necessary in order to implement the provisions of Section
6.9(a)(ii). Without limiting the foregoing, the Unitholders and Securityholder
Representative will cooperate reasonably and use commercially reasonable
efforts to have the now-current officers, directors and employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary cooperate with Purchaser in furnishing information,
evidence, testimony and other assistance in connection with the filing of any
Tax Return or any Tax Proceeding with respect to matters pertaining to any and
all periods beginning prior to the Closing Date. 

 

(d)Tax Proceedings. 

 

(i)The Securityholder Representative shall have the right, at the expense of
the Unitholders, to the extent related to any Pass-Through Tax Return for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, to
control any Tax Proceeding, initiate any claim for refund, contest, resolve
and defend against any assessment, notice of deficiency, or other adjustment
or proposed adjustment relating to any and all Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Securityholder Representative shall cause the Company to
elect the application of Section 6226 of the Code with respect to any imputed
underpayment arising out of any Tax Proceeding relating to a Pass-Through Tax
Return for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

(ii)Other than as relates to any matter for which the Securityholder
Representative has the right to control pursuant to Section 6.9(d)(i),
Purchaser shall have the right, at its own expense, to control any Tax
Proceeding, initiate any claim for refund, and contest, resolve and defend
against any assessment, notice of deficiency, or adjustment or proposed
adjustment relating to Taxes with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

 

(e)Post-Closing Actions. To the extent related to a Pass-Through Tax Return
of the Company or to the extent it otherwise relates to Taxes that would be
required to be included on a Tax Return of a Unitholder or could increase the
Tax liability of a Unitholder, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) shall,
without the prior written consent of the Securityholder Representative, (i)
make, change or revoke any Tax election affecting a taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date of the Company or any
Subsidiary, (ii) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of
any applicable statute of limitations with respect to) any Pass-Through Tax
Return of the Company or any Subsidiary relating to a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, or (iii) file or
request any ruling with respect to Taxes or Pass-Through Tax Returns of the
Company or any Subsidiary, or enter into any voluntary disclosure with any
Governmental Entity regarding any Tax or Pass-Through Tax

   

Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case relating to a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date) or (iv) take
any action that results in any increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax
asset of any Unitholder in respect of a taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date.

 

Section 6.10Preservation of Records. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to
the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a period of
seven (7) years following the Closing Date (or longer if required by
applicable Law) and during such period shall make such records (or copies) and
reasonably appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable advance notice, to the Securityholder Representative or any
Unitholder as may be reasonably required by such party in connection with any
insurance claims by, legal proceedings or Tax audits against, governmental
investigations of, or compliance with applicable Laws by, the Securityholder
Representative or the Unitholders or any of their Affiliates.

 

Section 6.11Listing. Purchaser shall promptly prepare and submit, or cause to
be prepared and submitted, to the NYSE a listing application covering the
Parent Class A Shares issuable in the Merger, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of
such Parent Class A Shares, subject to official notice of issuance, and the
Company shall cooperate with Purchaser with respect to such listing.

 

Section 6.12No Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall not take any action
which would cause the vote of the holders of any class or series of capital
stock or other equity interests of Parent to be necessary to adopt this
Agreement or to consummate any of the Transactions, including the issuance of
the Parent Class A Shares or Purchaser Units to be issued in the Transaction.

 

Section 6.13Escrow Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement. At the Closing, each
of Purchaser and the Securityholder Representative shall duly execute and
deliver to the other, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent to duly execute and deliver to Purchaser and
the Securityholder Representative, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, respectively.

 

Section 6.14Related Party Transactions. On or prior to the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i) terminate any Contracts with
Unitholders that are not Company Employees and their respective Affiliates,
except for those set forth on Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and (ii) deliver releases executed by Unitholders that are not Company
Employees providing that, except as otherwise set forth herein, no further
payments are due, or may become due, under or in respect of any such
terminated Contracts.

 

Section 6.15No Solicitation. During the pre-Closing period, the Company shall
not, and not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate,
facilitate or continue inquiries regarding a transaction for the sale of ten
percent (10%) or more of the equity securities, assets or businesses of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person (other than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates)
relating to or in connection with an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
any agreements, understandings or arrangements (whether or not binding)
relating to or in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.

   

Section 6.16Notification. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
each party will promptly notify the others of the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would reasonably be
likely to cause the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII. This
Section 6.16 and any information provided hereunder will not, and will not be
deemed to, limit, modify or otherwise affect any representation or warranty
contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Transactions or any party's rights hereunder (including rights
under Article VII). Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
(i) the Company shall, subject to Law and any applicable confidentiality
restrictions, inform Purchaser prior to entering into a new engagement letter,
customer contract or any other similar type of agreement, and (ii) the Company
and Purchaser will consult with each other periodically or otherwise establish
appropriate procedures to assess, in a manner that comports with Law and any
applicable confidentiality obligations, whether any actual or potential
conflicts of interest could arise from entering into new client engagements,
and in the event such an actual or potential conflict is identified, the
Company and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable efforts to prepare
an integration plan, consistent with Law, whereby such actual or potential
conflict would be addressed.

 

Section 6.17Parent Contribution. Parent shall contribute to Purchaser all

Affiliates referenced therein shall have complied with Section 6.6 in all
material respects.

 

(d)by Purchaser if (i) none of Purchaser or Merger Sub are in material breach
of any of their respective obligations hereunder and (ii) the Company is in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or obligations
hereunder that would render any condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) not to be satisfied, and such breach is either (A) not capable
of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is not cured
within the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after the giving of
written notice by Purchaser to the Company and (y) prior to the Outside Date;
and

 

(e)by the Company if (i) the Company is not in material breach of any of its
obligations hereunder and (ii) Purchaser and Merger Sub are in material breach
of any of their respective representations, warranties or obligations
hereunder that would render any condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) not to be satisfied, and such breach is either (A) not capable
of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is not cured
within the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after the giving of
written notice by the Company to Purchaser and (y) prior to the Outside Date.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to pay the Estimated Closing
Consideration when payable under the terms of this Agreement is not subject to
cure.

 

Section 8.2Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination and
abandonment by the Company or Purchaser, or both, pursuant to Section 8.1,
written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, and the
Transactions shall be abandoned, without further action by the Company, any
Unitholder, Purchaser or Merger Sub.

 

Section 8.3Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, then each of the parties shall be
relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the
date of such termination and such termination shall be without liability to
the Company or Purchaser; provided, however, that subject to the terms of this
Section 8.3, (i) no such termination shall (A) restrict the availability of
specific performance, if any, set forth in Section 10.13 with respect to
surviving obligations that are to be performed following such termination or
(B) relieve any party hereto from liability for damages resulting from any
Willful Breach and (ii) the provisions of Section 6.3, Section 6.4, this
Article VIII, Section 9.1 and Article X shall remain in full force and effect
and survive any

   

termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. For purposes of
this Section 8.3, the term "Willful Breach" means a party's knowing and
intentional material breach of any of its representations or warranties as set
forth in this Agreement, or such party's material breach of any of its
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which material
breach constitutes, or is a consequence of, a purposeful act or failure to act
by such party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to
take such act would cause a material breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing sentence, a failure by Purchaser and
Merger Sub to close in accordance with this Agreement when they are obligated
to do so shall be deemed to be a Willful Breach. 

 

Article IX 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 9.1No Reliance.

 

(a)Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV and
the representations and warranties of the Unitholders contained in the Letter
of Transmittal, Purchaser and Merger Sub are acquiring the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries "As-Is, Where-Is", and none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents or other
Representatives or any other Person or Non-Recourse Party has made or makes or
is authorized to make, and Purchaser hereby waives, any other express or
implied representation or warranty, express or implied, whether written or
oral, on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, Subsidiaries, controlling persons,
agents or other Representatives or any other Person.

 

(b)To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company in Article IV and
by the Unitholders in the Letter of Transmittal, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation on any basis (including in contract or tort, under
applicable federal or state securities Laws or otherwise) to Purchaser, Merger
Sub or any other Person resulting from the sharing with Purchaser and Merger
Sub or their Representative, or Purchaser's or Merger Sub's use of any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other materials made
available to Purchaser or Merger Sub in the Electronic Data Room or management
presentations (or omissions therefrom) in expectation of the Transactions or
otherwise. Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by
the Company in Article IV and expressly made by the Unitholders in the Letter
of Transmittal, it is understood, and Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub
acknowledge that any cost estimates, projections or other predictions, any
data, any financial information or any memoranda or offering materials or
presentations provided or addressed to Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub are not
and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations and warranties of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company in Article IV,
Parent, Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, to the Company's express disavowal and disclaimer
of any other representations and warranties, whether made by the Company or
any other Person on behalf of the Company, and of all liability and

representation, warranty, projections, forecasts or other materials made
available to Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub, including any opinion,
information, projection, forecast or other information that may have been or
may be provided to Parent, Purchaser or Merger Sub by any director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or other Representative of the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates. In furtherance of the foregoing, and not in
limitation thereof, Purchaser and Merger Sub specifically acknowledge and
agree that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any
Unitholder makes or has made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, with respect to any financial projection or forecast delivered to
Purchaser or Merger Sub with respect to the performance of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries either before or after the Closing Date. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of Parent, Purchaser,
Merger Sub and their Affiliates, that (i) such projections or forecasts are
being provided solely for the convenience of Purchaser to facilitate its own
independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections or forecasts,
(iii) Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties and (iv) Purchaser is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all projections or forecasts (including the reasonableness of the
underlying assumptions). Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledge that they have
conducted to their satisfaction their own independent investigation of the
condition, operations and businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries and,
in making their determination to proceed with the Transactions, Purchaser and
Merger Sub have been provided and have evaluated such documents and
information as they have deemed necessary and have relied solely on the
results of their own independent investigation and verification and the
representations and warranties expressly made by the Company in Article IV or
the Unitholders in their respective Letters of Transmittal.

 

(c)Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents and other
Representatives hereby acknowledge that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly made by the Company in Article IV, no other statutory,
express or implied representation or warranty, whether written or oral,
concerning the Units, or the business, assets or liabilities of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, the execution, delivery or performance of the
Transactions or any other matter, including any implied warranties of
merchantability and implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, is
or has been made.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall this Section 9.1 or any other provision of this Agreement be in
any way deemed a limitation of the recourse of the Company, the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Unitholders) or Purchaser in the event of
Fraud.

 

Section 9.2Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall terminate
effective as of the Closing and there shall be no liability in respect
thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to or after the Closing, on
the part of any party, its Affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, agents or other Representatives, except for those covenants and
agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part at or after the Closing, which shall survive in accordance with their
terms and, if no term is specified, then for the longest period permitted by
Law, and Article X. Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this
Section 9.2, no Action will be brought, encouraged, supported or maintained
by, or on behalf of,

   

Purchaser, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates, or the Company (and, after
the Closing Date, the Surviving Entity) or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates against any Company Party, and no recourse will be sought or
granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or any other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement or
any other document contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument,
opinion, agreement or other document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or any other Person delivered hereunder, the subject matter of
this Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby, the Transactions,
the business, the ownership, operation, management, use or control of the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or
any actions or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing Date; provided, that in
no event shall this Section 9.2 be in any way deemed a limitation of the
recourse of the Company, the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Unitholders) or Purchaser in the event of Fraud.

 

Section 9.3Release. Effective upon the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Entity
and their Subsidiaries, in each case on behalf of itself and its respective
controlled Affiliates (collectively, the "Releasers"), hereby knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly waives, acquits, remises, discharges and
forever releases each Company Party and its respective successors and assigns
from any and all liabilities and obligations to such Releasers of any kind or
nature whatsoever, solely in the capacity as a Unitholder or a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time,
in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known
or unknown, matured or unmatured or determined or determinable, and whether
arising under any Law or Contract (other than this Agreement, the Transaction
Agreements and any of the other agreements executed and delivered in
connection herewith, but, in each case, only to the extent set forth herein or
therein) or otherwise at law or in equity, relating in any way to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or their relationships therewith, and each of the
Releasers hereby agrees that it will not seek to recover any amounts in
connection therewith or thereunder from any Company Party in their capacity as
a Unitholder or a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and their respective successors and
assigns (except as provided for in this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements
or any of the other agreements executed and delivered in connection herewith,
but, in each case, only to the extent set forth herein or therein).

 

Section 9.4No Subrogation. Purchaser and its Affiliates will not enter into
or amend, waive or otherwise modify any insurance policy in any manner that
would allow the insurer thereunder or any other Person to subrogate or
otherwise make or bring any proceeding against any Unitholder or any Affiliate
thereof or any past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee or
advisor of any of the foregoing based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.

bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address

Schedules), together with the other Transaction Agreements constitute the

and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with
respect to such subject matter; provided, however, this Agreement shall not

shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in
accordance with its terms and this Agreement.

Section 10.9Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company Disclosure Schedule and
the information and disclosures contained therein relate to and qualify
certain of the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations made by
the Company in this Agreement and shall not be construed or otherwise deemed
to constitute, any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the
Company or any other Person except to the extent explicitly provided in this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of
any of such representations, warranties, covenants or obligations. No
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or indication, in and
of itself, that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance, that such item has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or that such item or other matter
is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule.
No reference in the Company Disclosure Schedule to any agreement or document,
in and of itself, shall be construed as an admission or indication that such
agreement or document is enforceable or currently in effect or that there are
any obligations remaining to be performed or any rights that may be exercised

   

under such agreement or document. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure
Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, law or
regulation, in and of itself, shall be construed as an admission or indication
that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The Company
Disclosure Schedule and the information and disclosures contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedule are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Company contained in the
Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of
any of such representations, warranties or covenants. The information
contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule is confidential, proprietary
information of the Company, and Purchaser and Merger Sub shall be obligated to
maintain and protect such confidential information pursuant to this Agreement.
The Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to the
Sections in the Agreement and any items or matters set forth in one section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds
and each other Section or subsection of the Agreement to the extent the
relevance of such items or matters to such other Section or subsection of this
Agreement is reasonably apparent. The bold-faced headings contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedule are included for convenience and reference only,
and are not intended to limit the effect of the disclosures contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or to expand, modify or influence the scope of the
information required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
interpretation of this Agreement. In disclosing the information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company expressly does not waive any attorney-client
privilege or other similar privilege associated with such information or any
protection afforded by the work-product doctrine or other similar doctrine
with respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed therein.

 

Section 10.10Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed and delivered by the
Company, the Securityholder Representative and Purchaser. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, any failure of any party to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party
entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the
party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 

Section 10.11Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile or email in Portable Document
Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement.

 

Section 10.12Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns except (a) as set
forth in Section 6.7, Section 10.16 and Section 10.17, (b) for the right of
the Securityholder Representative and the Company on behalf of the Unitholders
to pursue damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic
benefits of the Transactions, including Article III, to the Unitholders) in
the event the Effective Time has not occurred as a result of Purchaser's or
Merger Sub's Willful Breach of this Agreement (whether or not this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1) or (c)

   

after the Effective Time, if Purchaser shall not have made payments in
accordance with Article III, the right of each Unitholder to enforce directly,
or through the Securityholder Representative, its right to receive the amounts
payable pursuant to Article III, each of which rights set forth in clauses
(a), (b) and (c) hereof are hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed to by
Purchaser and Merger Sub, nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified
period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.13Remedies. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity and shall waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any
such remedy. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the party seeking the injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief has an adequate remedy of Law. The remedies available to the
Company pursuant to this Section 10.13 shall be in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, and the election to
pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit the Company from seeking to obtain such other remedies.

 

Section 10.14Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof; provided; that the parties intend that the
remedies and limitations on remedies contained in this Agreement to be
construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such remedies and
limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a party's
liability or obligations hereunder

 

Section 10.15Mutual Drafting. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have
been represented by attorneys throughout the negotiation of the Transactions
who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the
parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

   

Section 10.16Securityholder Representative.

 

(a)Pursuant to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company, it will be
deemed to have irrevocably appointed, authorized and empowered the
Securityholder Representative to act as a representative for the benefit of
each Unitholder as the exclusive agent and attorney‑in‑fact with the power and
authority to act on behalf of each Unitholder in connection with and to
facilitate the consummation of the Transactions, which shall include the power
and authority:

 

(i)to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the
Transactions as the Securityholder Representative, in its sole discretion, may
deem necessary or desirable, including any amendments or modifications to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements;

 

(ii)to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Unitholders and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Securityholder
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and thereby or the Transactions, and to take any and all
actions which the Securityholder Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements for and
on behalf of the Unitholders. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Securityholder Representative may (A) assert any claim or
institute any Action, (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Action
initiated by Purchaser or any other Person, or by any Governmental Entity
against the Securityholder Representative and/or the Unitholders, (C) receive
process on behalf of any or all Unitholders in any such Action and compromise
or settle on such terms as it shall determine to be appropriate, and give
receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such Action, (D) file
any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as it may deem advisable or
necessary; and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or
award rendered in any such Action (it being understood that the Securityholder
Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and
shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such actions);

 

(iii)to refrain from enforcing any right of the Unitholders, arising out of or
under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or the other documents
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no such failure to act on the
part of the Securityholder Representative, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, shall be deemed a waiver
of any such right or interest by the Securityholder Representative or by the
Unitholders unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by
the Securityholder Representative;

   

(iv)to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Securityholder
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the Transactions, and
all other agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein
or executed in connection herewith and therewith;

 

(v)to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or received
under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection with any
claims under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including
service of process in connection with any arbitration;

 

(vi)to determine whether to deliver a Notice of Disagreement and to resolve
any disputes regarding the Closing Statement; and

 

(vii)to make or receive any payments or to pay any expenses under or in
connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements on behalf
of the Unitholders, including by using the Securityholder Representative Funds
(and any interest or earnings thereon) to satisfy costs, expenses and/or
liabilities of the Securityholder Representative in connection with matters
related to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements (the
"Securityholder Representative Expenses"), with any balance of the
Securityholder Representative Funds not used for such purposes to be disbursed
and paid, at such time as the Securityholder Representative determines, in its
sole discretion, that no additional Securityholder Representative Expenses
shall become due and payable, to the Unitholders in accordance with Section
3.2(a) and Section 3.2(c)(ii).

 

(b)Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
consent of the Unitholder(s) comprising the Class A Majority Interest (as
defined in the LLC Agreement) shall be required for the Securityholder
Representative to make any compromise, settlement, or agreement that would
require the payment of any amounts not expressly provided for in this
Agreement by the Unitholders.

 

(c)Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity may rely upon all actions
taken or omitted to be taken by the Securityholder Representative pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, all of which actions or
omissions shall be legally binding upon the Unitholders.

 

(d)The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Unitholder, and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the
Transactions and by the other Transaction Agreements.

 

(e)All actions taken by the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements shall be binding upon all Unitholders and
their respective successors and assigns as if expressly confirmed and ratified
in writing by each of them. Purchaser shall serve notice to, and deal
exclusively with, the Securityholder

   

Representative with respect to any and all matters concerning any of the
Unitholders arising out of or related to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements and all other agreements or instruments contemplated
hereby or thereby or the Transactions, and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document
purported by the Securityholder Representative to have been executed by or on
behalf of the Unitholders as fully binding upon them. If the Securityholder
Representative shall resign, dissolve, cease to exist or otherwise be unable
to fulfill its responsibilities as representative of the Unitholders, the
Unitholders shall, within ten (10) days after the occurrence of such event,
appoint (by majority vote or consent of the Unitholders) a successor
representative and, promptly thereafter, shall notify the Unitholders of the
identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed to the rights
and obligations of the Securityholder Representative as representative of the
Unitholders hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholder
Representative at any time, all references herein or in any other agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby to the Securityholder Representative in which
the Securityholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Unitholders shall be deemed to refer to the Unitholders. Each Unitholder,
upon the execution of a Letter of Transmittal, agrees that any action taken by
the Securityholder Representative on its behalf pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the other agreements and
instruments contemplated hereby and thereby shall be fully binding on them.

 

(f)By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each Unitholder irrevocably
shall agree that the Securityholder Representative shall have no liability to
any Unitholder with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its
capacity as the Securityholder Representative and that the Securityholder
Representative shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity
as the Securityholder Representative, unless the Securityholder Representative
has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
determination of Securityholder Representative, are sufficient to protect the
Securityholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Securityholder Representative in responding to
such direction or taking such action. By the execution of a Letter of
Transmittal, each Unitholder irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Securityholder Representative) shall
be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons.
Without limiting Section 10.16(a)(vii), by the execution of a Letter of
Transmittal each Unitholder irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Securityholder
Representative Funds for all expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Securityholder Representative in such capacity,
and shall be entitled to indemnification from the Unitholders against any
loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative (except for those
arising out of Securityholder Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. To the extent the Securityholder Representative Funds are
insufficient to cover the Securityholder Representative's costs, expenses and
liabilities hereunder, the Unitholders will indemnify the Securityholder
Representative in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence on a pro
rata basis based on their respective equity interest in the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing.

   

(g)The parties acknowledge that the Securityholder Representative's
obligations under this Section 10.16 are solely as a representative of the
Unitholders and that the Securityholder Representative shall have no personal
responsibility for any expenses incurred by it in such capacity.

 

Section 10.17No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith (other than the Letters of Transmittal), by its acceptance
of the benefits of this Agreement, the parties each covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub and the
Company have any liabilities, obligations, commitments (whether known or
unknown or whether contingent or otherwise) hereunder and that,
notwithstanding that the parties may be partnerships, corporations or limited
liability companies, no party has any right of recovery under this Agreement,
or any claim based on such liabilities, obligations, commitments against, and
no personal liability shall attach to, the former, current or future equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers or general or limited partners of any of the
parties or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager,
Affiliate or agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, but not including
the parties, each a "Non-Recourse Party"), through the parties or otherwise,
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through
a claim by or on behalf of any party against any Non-Recourse Party; by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or Law, or otherwise.

 

Section 10.18Representation. Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each of Merger Sub and their respective directors, officers,
managers, employees and Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP may serve as counsel to the Unitholders and their
Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
contemplated transactions, including any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the contemplated transactions
notwithstanding any representation by Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP prior to
the Closing Date of the Company. Purchaser and the Company hereby (a) waive
any claim they have or may have that Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises either
before or after the Closing between Purchaser and any of the Unitholders or
any of their respective Affiliates, Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP may
represent the Unitholders or any of their respective Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to
Purchaser or the Company and even though Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP may
have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute. Purchaser and the Company also further agree that, as to all
communications prior to Closing among Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP and the
Company, the Unitholders or their respective Affiliates or Representatives
that relate in any way to the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Unitholders and may be
controlled by the Unitholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser
or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Purchaser, the Company and a third party other than a party to
this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP to such third party; provided, however, that the
Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative.

   

Section 10.19Parent Guaranty. Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Company and the Unitholders the due and punctual payment and
performance by Purchaser of Purchaser's obligations and liabilities under this
Agreement, including the payment of Parent Class A Shares pursuant to Article
III of this Agreement. The foregoing sentence is an absolute, unconditional
and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual discharge and performance of
such obligations.

Annex A

 

Purchase Price Adjustment Principles

 

    



 |  

1.

 |  

The Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement shall be prepared
from the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis using the same accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices and procedures as were used in the preparation of the Latest Balance
Sheet. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

2.

 |  

To the extent not otherwise addressed in item 1 above, the Estimated Closing
Statement and the Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
as at the Closing Date. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

3.

 |  

No account shall be taken of events taking place after the Adjustment Time,
and regard shall only be had to information available to the parties to this
Agreement up to the date that the Notice of Disagreement is delivered by the
Securityholder Representative to Purchaser. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

4.

 |  

The Closing Statement shall be prepared on the basis that the Company and its
Subsidiaries are a going concern and shall exclude the effect of change of
control or ownership of the Company or its Subsidiaries and will not take into
account the effects of any post-Closing reorganizations or the post-Closing
intentions or obligations of Parent or Purchaser. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

5.

 |  

The provisions of this Annex A shall be interpreted so as to avoid double
counting (whether positive or negative) of any item to be included in the
calculation of the Estimated Closing Consideration or Final Closing
Consideration.
