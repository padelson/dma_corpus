Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Article VI to be satisfied. 

  

 Section 5.6 _Pre-Closing Arrangements_.  Buyers and Seller shall enter into, concurrently herewith, the Transition Services Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. Except as set forth in Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or identified by Buyers immediately prior to Closing and set forth on Schedule 1.1(a)(iii) of the Transition Services Agreement, all of the intercompany arrangements between Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, on the other hand, including those agreements listed in Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, will be terminated immediately prior to the Closing and all intercompany balances previously disclosed to Buyers between Seller and its respective Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, on the other hand, other than as set forth in _Section 5.7(k)_, will be paid in full and settled immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that all intercompany Tax amounts shall be settled in accordance with Article VIII hereof; and _provided_ _further_ that nothing in this _Section 5.6(a)_ is intended to terminate (A) any title insurance agency arrangement, (B) any service agreements with Data Trace with respect to title plants or (C) any other intercompany arrangement or agreement identified on Schedule 1.1(a)(iii) to the Transition Services.

 (f) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions necessary so that each Company Benefit Plan which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (including for the avoidance of doubt each LFG Deferred Compensation Plan), and the trust established pursuant to each such Company Benefit Plan, is amended to provide that neither the execution and delivery of the Stock Purchase Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, requires the funding of any such plan or trust. 

   

 Section 5.7 _Regulatory Matters_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, permits or orders from all third parties and Governmental Entities. 

   

 (b) Each of Buyers and Seller shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself (or in the case of Seller, the Companies), its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Buyers, Seller, the Companies, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties shall request and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. 

   

 (d) Each of Buyers, on the one hand, and Seller and the Companies, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 5.7(c)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any

proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, permit the other party to review

opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. 

   

 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in  _Sections 5.7(c)_ and _5.7(d)_ , if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Buyers, on the one hand, and Seller and the Companies, on the other hand, shall use their reasonable best efforts to (x) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and (y) do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction may assert under any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date), in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; _provided_ that neither the Companies nor any of their Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Companies or any of their Affiliates, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Companies only in the event that the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyers shall not be required to agree to or accept (but in their discretion may agree to or accept), and Seller shall not, and shall not permit the Companies, without the prior written consent of Buyers, to, agree to or accept, unless requested to do so by Buyers (subject to the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence) any condition sought by any Governmental Entity or other person in connection with any consent or approval required to complete or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that (A) seeks to prohibit or limit in any material respect the ownership or operation by the Companies, their Subsidiaries, either Buyer or any of their Affiliates of the business or assets of any of them, or to compel the Companies or either Buyer or any of their Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any significant portion of their business or assets as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) seeks to impose limitations on the ability of either Buyer to acquire, hold, or exercise 

   ##### 

  

   

full rights of direct or indirect ownership of the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries, including the right to vote the capital stock of the Companies
on all matters properly presented to the shareholders of the Companies and
the rights to declare or pay dividends on any capital stock of the Companies
or any of their Subsidiaries, (C) seeks to prohibit either Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any material respect the
business or operations of such Buyer, the Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, (D) would individually or in
the aggregate reasonably be expected to significantly and adversely affect
the benefits, taken as a whole, that either Buyer reasonably expects to
derive from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (E) would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to significantly and adversely affect the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Companies and their Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. 

   

 (f) Subject to _Section 5.7(e)_, in the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, Seller and Buyers each shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (g) Each of Buyers and Seller and the Companies shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed. 

   

 (h) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in  _Sections 5.7(a)_, _(d)_ , _(e)_ or _(f)_ , with respect to the consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations and permits sought to be obtained from third parties (other than from Governmental Entities) (" _Third Party Consents_ "), the costs paid to any third party with respect to Third Party Consents shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyers. To the extent that a party seeking a Third Party Consent is unable to obtain such Third Party Consent for anything necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such party shall obtain acceptable alternative arrangements, with the other partys participation, cooperation and approval; _provided_ , that the costs paid to any third party with respect to obtaining any acceptable alternative arrangement shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyers; _provided further_ , that this obligation shall survive Closing. 

   

 (i) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Regulatory Laws_ " means any Law enacted by any Governmental Entity relating to antitrust matters, insurance, or regulating competition. 

   

 (j) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Law_ " means applicable statutes, common laws, rules, ordinances, regulations, codes, orders, judgments, injunctions, writs, decrees, governmental guidelines or interpretations having the force of law or bylaws, in each case, of a Governmental Entity. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (k) Buyers require as a condition to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby that the Nebraska Department of Insurance and, if applicable, the California Department of Insurance and the Final Approval Order confirm that the intercompany receivables on the balance sheets of the Companies continue to be counted as an admitted asset (the " _Asset Approval_ "). In order to accomplish this result, at the Closing, pursuant to an assumption agreement in a form mutually agreed, FNF will assume the obligation with respect to the intercompany receivables due from Seller or its Subsidiaries to LTIC, UCTIC and to Commonwealth, which intercompany receivables are, in each case, set forth on Section 5.7(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Seller covenants that the amount of such intercompany receivables at Closing shall not exceed the amount set forth on such Section 5.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Seller shall not, and shall not cause its Subsidiaries to, take actions for the purpose of increasing the amount of the intercompany receivables, and any inflows and outflows among Seller, the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries shall be effected in the ordinary course of business. 

   

 Section 5.8 _Employees_. 

   

 (a) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under each employee benefit plan maintained by Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries, Buyers shall cause such employee benefit plan to recognize the service of each employee who is actively employed by the Companies and their Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Closing Date under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided that_ the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans or to the extent such operation would result in a duplication of benefits for a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service or to the extent such period of service is not recognized under the applicable Buyer employee benefit plan for its similarly situated employees. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans maintained by Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries to the extent coverage under such plans is comparable to, and a replacement for, a Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) with respect to any health, dental, vision or other welfare plans of Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, Buyers shall use their reasonable best efforts to (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Buyer or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee, to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (y) recognize any health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Covered Employees shall remain covered through the date that is 60 days after Closing Date (or a shorter period after the Closing Date, at Buyers option) under the Sellers health and welfare plans that provided health, dental and vision benefits to such Covered Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _LFG Health Plans_ ") (the date through which the Covered Employees remain covered by the LFG Health Plans, the " _Coverage Cut-Off Date_ "), immediately following which the Covered Employees shall be covered by the health and welfare plans maintained by Buyers and their Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 5.8(a) of this Agreement. Buyers shall cause the Companies to pay to Seller the amount of covered health, dental and vision claims incurred by the Covered Employees through the Coverage Cut-Off Date to the extent such claims are not paid as of the Closing Date, less Covered Employee premiums actually paid to Seller on and after the Closing Date or paid to Buyers or the Companies and transferred to Seller on and after the Closing Date. In no event shall the operation of this Section 5.8(b) result in duplication of payments in respect of an obligation under this Section 5.8(b). 

   

 (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, FNF or its designee (which shall be one of the Companies or another wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF) shall assume sponsorship of, and all obligations under, the Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 5.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _LFG Deferred Compensation Plans_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and FNF shall take any and all actions required such that, effective as of the Closing, FNF or its designee (which shall be one of the Companies or another wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF) shall (i) (A) assume sponsorship of, and all obligations under, the LFG Deferred Compensation Plans, and (B) discharge all obligations under such LFG Deferred Compensation Plans, (ii) be the grantor and the "Company" under each rabbi trust (the " _Rabbi Trusts_ ") established in connection with the LFG Deferred Compensation Plans of which Seller is the current grantor, such that the assets in the Rabbi Trusts will be available for the payment of benefits under the LFG Deferred Compensation Plans, and (iii) be the owner of all corporate owned life insurance policies purchased as a funding source for the LFG Deferred Compensation Plans. 

   

 (d) At or prior to Closing, Seller shall vest, or cause to be vested, each Covered Employee in all Company Benefit Plans which are not Assumed Plans, including but not limited to any equity awards. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any provision in any agreement by and between Seller or any of its Affiliates and Buyers or any of their Affiliates, each Buyer or any of its Affiliates may make offers of employment on such terms as it shall determine to be effective on or after the Closing Date to any employees of Seller and its Affiliates which employees primarily provide services to the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, the seven personnel currently managing the Dallas Data Center facility located at 2201 W Plano Parkway, Plano, Texas. Further, Buyers may assume the real estate and equipment leases in respect of the foregoing facility dedicated to serving the Company, subject to the receipt of any third party waiver, consent or approval and subject to any required approval by the Chapter 11 Court. 

   

 (f) From and after the Closing Date, (i) Buyers or their Affiliates shall (x) assume, or cause the Companies to continue, as the case may be, sponsorship of, and all liabilities under, each Assumed Plan and (y) assume or discharge all obligations under such Assumed Plans as of the Closing Date and (ii) Buyers shall, or shall cause their Subsidiaries to, 

   ##### 

  

   

honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date hereof
or as may be amended after the date hereof (i) with the prior written consent
of Buyers or (ii) as permitted pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)_ of this
Agreement, each Assumed Plan. 

   

 (g) Nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall be construed to limit the right of Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Companies and their Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Assumed Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this  _Section 5.8_ be construed to prohibit the Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Companies and their Subsidiaries) from terminating the employment of any particular Covered Employee following the Closing Date. 

   

 (h) Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.8_, the provisions of this  _Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose. 

   

 (i) From and after the date hereof, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the Companies or their Subsidiaries indemnify or reimburse Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Companies or their Subsidiaries) in respect of any severance or change of control benefits payable by Seller or any such Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than benefits payable by the Companies and their Subsidiaries, with respect to which Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not be responsible), under any existing cost-reimbursement arrangement or otherwise. For purposes of this provision, Sellers Subsidiaries shall not include the Companies and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise, following the date hereof Buyers and their Affiliates shall be permitted to discuss with (i) employees of the Companies and their Subsidiaries their continued employment with the Companies and their Subsidiaries or with Buyers or their other Affiliates following the Closing, (ii) with agents their continued roles with the Companies and their Subsidiaries or with Buyers or their other Affiliates following the Closing, and (ii) with customers the transactions contemplated hereby, and in each case to provide them assurances with respect thereto; _provided_ , that this provision will not allow Buyers or their Affiliates to hire any such employee unless and until the Closing occurs. 

   

 (k) Seller shall cause the enrolled actuary (the " _Plan Actuary_ ") for the LandAmerica Cash Balance Plan (the " _Cash Balance Plan_ ") to calculate the benefit obligation under the Cash Balance Plan as of a date not more than five business days prior to the Closing Date (such date, the " _Calculation Date_ "), such benefit obligation to be the sum of (i) the amount of the cash balance account as of the Calculation Date in respect of each Cash Balance Plan participant who is, on the Calculation Date, or could be following the Calculation Date, entitled to receive Cash Balance Plan benefits in the form of a lump sum, plus (ii) the aggregate benefit obligation in respect of all Cash Balance Plan participants not described in the preceding clause (i), computed on an accounting (ongoing) basis (not on a termination basis) using the same 

   ##### 

  

   

methodology utilized to determine the "benefit obligation at end of year" in
Sellers Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007; provided that the
interest rate used to make such calculation shall be the prevailing interest
rate used by Mercer (the Cash Balance Plans enrolled actuary) as of the
Calculation Date to compute benefit obligations of defined benefit plans of
its clients generally (the amount of such benefit obligation calculated
hereunder, the " _Current Benefit Obligation_ "). In the event that the
Current Benefit Obligation exceeds the market value of the LandAmerica Cash
Balance Plans assets on the Calculation Date (such excess, if any, the "
_Funding Amount_ "), upon the Closing, Seller shall contribute to the
LandAmerica Cash Balance Plan from the Purchase Price proceeds an amount
equal to the Funding Amount. In such event, Buyers shall be entitled to fund
these amounts on behalf of Seller directly to the Cash Balance Plan from the
Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Chapter 11 Court Order
shall require such funding, if any, on the part of Seller. In addition,
Seller agrees that, prior to the Closing, it shall not take action or
initiate any proceeding to terminate the Cash Balance Plan. 

   

 Section 5.9 _Certain Transfers and Licenses_. 

   

 (a) _Rights in Certain Trademarks and Contracts_. Prior to or at the Closing or as promptly as practicable thereafter, and subject to the receipt of any third party waiver, consent or approval and subject to any required approval by the Chapter 11 Court, Seller shall transfer or assign, or cause to be transferred or assigned to the Companies and their Subsidiaries (i) all Intellectual Property owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) that is used solely in the businesses of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, (ii) all rights in and to the name "Commonwealth," "United Title," "Lawyers Title" and any of the names and trademarks set forth on Section 5.9(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), (iii) each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding to which Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) is a party that relates to the use of Intellectual Property solely in connection with the businesses of the Companies and their Subsidiaries; and (iv) any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding set forth on Section 5.9(a)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such transfers shall be at no additional cost to Buyer, the Companies or their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Intellectual Property set forth on Section 5.9(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule nor rights in the words "LandAmerica" nor derivatives thereof nor the LandAmerica logo nor derivatives thereof shall be transferred or assigned to the Companies or their Subsidiaries. 

   

 (b) _License to Certain Trademarks_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), shall grant to the Companies and their Subsidiaries (each a " _Company Licensed Party_ " and together the " _Company Licensed Parties_ ") a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, sublicenseable to Affiliates of Buyers (on multiple levels), non-transferable (except as set forth herein) right and license to use all Trademarks owned by Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) and used in the businesses of the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, including those on Section 5.9(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (" _Seller Trademarks_ ") on any materials that prior to Closing included any Seller Trademarks, including signage, advertising, promotional materials, software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards, web sites, invoices, 

   ##### 

  

   

receipts, forms, product, training and service literature and materials and
other materials (" _Materials_ ") in connection with the respective
businesses of a Company Licensed Party for (x) a period of 180 days following
the Closing Date for such Materials that do not require approvals from any
Governmental Entity to be modified; and (y) the period of time following
the Closing Date until 180 days after all applicable Governmental Entities
have granted the Licensed Parties approval to modify Materials that require
such approvals to be modified; _provided_ , that the applicable Company
Licensed Party use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approvals
from the applicable Governmental Entities as promptly as possible after the
Closing Date. Subject to applicable Law, the Company Licensed Parties use of
the Seller Trademarks during the applicable term as set forth in this
_Section 5.9(b)_ shall be only with Sellers prior written consent (which
consent is deemed given for all uses of the Seller Trademarks as they
are used in the businesses of the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof). No Company Licensed Party shall be required to remove or
replace any Seller Trademarks from any Materials that were distributed prior
to Closing or during the term of the license set forth in this
_Section 5.9(b)_. 

   

 (c) _License to Certain Owned Intellectual Property_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), shall grant to the Company Licensed Parties a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicenseable to Affiliates of Buyers(on multiple levels) right and license, in and to all Intellectual Property owned by Seller and its Affiliates immediately following the Closing Date (other than Seller Trademarks), that is or was used in or in connection with any of the respective businesses of the Company Licensed Parties and that is embedded in the systems or Intellectual Property of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, for use in and in connection with the respective businesses of such Company Licensed Parties. The foregoing license shall be fully transferable, but only in connection with the sale of such systems or Intellectual Property of the Companies. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Possible Transfer of Certain Assets_. 

   

 (a) _Southland Assets_. The parties acknowledge that it may be economically efficient and optimal if the assets owned by Seller or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries known as "Southland" (the " _Southland Assets_ ") were joined with the businesses conducted and assets owned by the Companies and their Subsidiaries. Accordingly, on or before the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyers with a detailed description of the Southland Assets. At the sole election of Buyers, the parties shall negotiate to provide for the transfer or assignment (by Seller or its applicable Affiliates) of the Southland Assets (and the assumption of the related liabilities) to Buyers or one of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as directed by Buyers, for consideration to be mutually agreed. The parties will act in good faith to determine if Schedule 1.1(a)(i) or Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) or both of the Transition Services Agreement should be modified to include any Corporate Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) necessary to support the Southland Assets and, if so, amend the applicable schedules thereto and provide the necessary Corporate Services in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement. The foregoing shall be subject to receipt of any necessary approval by the Chapter 11 Court. 

   

 (b) _Other Assets_. The parties acknowledge that it may be economically efficient and optimal if certain other businesses owned by Seller or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries 

    ##### 

  

    

(other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) that are tangential (but
integral) to the title business (e.g., production resources and claims
services) (the " _Other Assets_ ") were joined with the businesses conducted
and assets owned by the Companies and their Subsidiaries. Accordingly, on or
before the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyers with a detailed description
of the Other Assets. At the sole election of Buyers, the parties shall
negotiate to provide for the transfer or assignment (by Seller or its
applicable Affiliates) of the Other Assets (and the assumption of the related
liabilities) to the Companies, Buyers or one of its or their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as directed by Buyers, for consideration to be mutually agreed.
The parties will act in good faith to determine if Schedule 1.1(a)(i) or
Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) or both of the Transition Services Agreement should be
modified to include any Corporate Services necessary to support the Other
Assets and, if so, amend the applicable schedules thereto and provide
the necessary Corporate Services in accordance with the Transition Services
Agreement. The foregoing shall be subject to receipt of any necessary
approval by the Chapter 11 Court. 

   

 (c) _Transfer of Certain Software_. On or before the conclusion of the term of the Transition Services Agreement, and subject to the receipt of any third party waiver, consent or approval and subject to any required approval by the Chapter 11 Court, at Buyers option and in Buyers sole discretion, Seller shall transfer or assign (or cause to be transferred and assigned) to the Buyers or the Companies or their Subsidiaries any third party software licenses or any hardware owned by or licensed to Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) that is primarily used in the operation of the businesses by Companies or their Subsidiaries; to the extent that there are any costs payable to a third party to consent to such transfer or assignment, such costs shall be borne by Buyers. Such transfers or assignments, with respect to Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be at no additional costs to Buyers, the Companies or their Subsidiaries. With respect to third party software licenses or hardware that is primarily used by Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in the operation of their businesses and that is also used in the operation of the businesses of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, Seller will notify Buyers as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and the parties shall work together to determine whether the parties can continue to jointly use such software and hardware upon Closing; if such software or hardware cannot be jointly used upon Closing, then, at Buyers sole option and in Buyers sole discretion, the parties shall obtain alternative sources therefor as of the Closing or Seller shall provide such software or hardware as a Transition Services Agreement, subject to _Section 5.7(h)_ of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the stated intention of the parties that Buyers or the Companies or their Subsidiaries shall obtain, either by transfer or assignment from Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or from other sources acceptable to Buyers in their sole discretion, all third party software licenses or any hardware that are primarily used in the operation of the businesses by the Companies and their Subsidiaries or that are material to the operation of the businesses of the Companies and their Subsidiaries. 

   

 (d) _Transfer of Other Agreements_. On or before the conclusion of the term of the Transition Services Agreement, and subject to the receipt of any third party waiver, consent or approval and subject to any required approval by the Chapter 11 Court, at Buyers option and in Buyers sole discretion, Seller shall transfer or assign (or cause to be transferred and assigned) to Buyers or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any third party agreement or third party service other than those subject to _Section 5.10(c)_ (including, by way of example, agency agreements, if any) entered into or received by Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that is primarily used in the 

   ##### 

  

   

operation of the businesses by the Companies and their Subsidiaries; to the
extent that there are any costs payable to a third party to consent to such
transfer or assignment, such costs shall be borne by Buyers. With respect to
any agreement or third party service that is primarily used by Seller or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in the operation of their businesses that is also
used in the operation of the businesses of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries, Seller will notify Buyers as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement and the parties shall work together to determine
whether the Parties can continue to jointly use such agreement or third party
service upon Closing; if such agreement or third party service cannot be
jointly used upon Closing, then, at Buyers sole option and in Buyers sole
discretion, the parties shall obtain alternative sources therefor as of
Closing or Seller shall provide the benefits of such agreement or such third
party service as a Transition Service, subject to _Section 5.7(h)_ of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the stated intention of the
parties that Buyers or the Companies or their Subsidiaries shall obtain,
either by transfer or assignment from Seller or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or from other sources acceptable to Buyers in their sole
discretion, all third agreements and third party services that are primarily
used in the operation of the businesses by the Companies and their
Subsidiaries or that are material to the operation of the businesses of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries. 

   

 Section 5.11 _Certain Bankruptcy Provisions_. 

   

 (a) Within one day after execution and delivery hereof, Seller shall file a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the " _Bankruptcy Code_ ") in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia or such other forum as Buyers may agree (the " _Chapter 11 Court_"). Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the entry of an order, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyers, approving the sale of the Shares to Buyers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than any transfers or assignments of assets or agreements contemplated to occur after the Closing or the sale of the Southland Assets and the Other Assets) (the " _Chapter 11 Court Order_") as promptly as possible following the filing of Sellers bankruptcy petition. Seller shall schedule its first hearing date before the Chapter 11 Court as promptly as practicable, and at such hearing shall request that the hearing to issue the Chapter 11 Court Order be held as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. 

   

 (b) Buyers shall have the right to appoint a restructuring consultant (the " _Buyer Consultant_ "), at its own expense, to observe the operations of the Companies and their Subsidiaries from the date hereof until the Closing Date. Without limiting Section 5.4, so long as such access does not significantly interfere with the operation of the business of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, the Buyer Consultant shall have: (i) access to the books and records and all other documents and information concerning the Companies and their Subsidiaries and their respective businesses; (ii) access to and be entitled to work at any of the offices or facilities at which the Companies and their Subsidiaries currently operates; and (iii) access to the employees (including senior management) of the Companies and their Subsidiaries.

To the extent reasonably practical, Seller will provide Buyers with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon all motions, applications and supporting papers prepared by Seller (including forms of orders and notices to interested parties) prior to the filing thereof in the Chapter 11 Court or the Rehabilitation Court. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Seller shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person relating to any sale or potential sale of the Companies, or any of them or their assets, unless any such Person first enters into a confidentiality agreement (including provisions regarding the solicitation and hiring of employees) that is at least as protective of the Companies as the Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, Seller shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates, to provide any confidential or non-public information or materials to any such other Person unless such information or materials are substantially simultaneously provided to Buyers.

Anything in this _Article IX_ to the contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification relating to Tax matters (including indemnification for breach of the representations and warranties of  _Section 3.10_) shall be governed exclusively by _Article VIII_. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Third Party Claim Procedures_. In the case of any claim asserted by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against a party entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), notice shall be given by the Indemnified Party to the party required to provide indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party and so long as the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for Losses related to such Third Party Claim) to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim,  _provided_ that (a) counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified Partys expense, and (b) the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except to the extent that such failure results in a lack of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to be given notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not promptly assume the defense of such Third Party Claim following notice thereof, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense and to settle or agree to pay in full such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party without prejudice to the ability of the Indemnified Party to enforce its claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying Party hereunder. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such Third Party Claim, shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of an irrevocable release from all liability and wrongdoing with respect to such Third Party Claim. Seller and

Buyers shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this
_Article IX_ and the records of each shall be reasonably available to the
other with respect to such defense.

 Section 10.1 _Standard_. No representation or warranty of Seller contained in  _Article III_ or of Buyers contained in _Article IV_ shall be deemed untrue, inaccurate or incorrect for purposes of _Section 6.2(a)_ or _6.3(a)_ of this Agreement, and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for such purpose under this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or when taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any representations or warranties contained in _Article III_, in the case of Seller, or _Article IV_, in the case of Buyers, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Companies or Buyers, respectively (disregarding for purposes of this _Section 10.1_ all qualifications or limitations set forth in any representations or warranties as to "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, (i) the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.2(a)_ shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct in all respects other than to a de minimis extent (relative to _Section 3.2(a)_, taken as a whole) and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 3.2(b)_, _3.3(a)_ , _3.3(b)_ , _3.3(c)(i)_ , _3.7_ ,  _3.20_ , and _3.21_ shall be deemed untrue and incorrect if not true and correct in all material respects.

 Section 10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart. Either party may deliver its signed counterpart of this Agreement to the other party by means of facsimile or any other electronic medium, and such delivery will have the same legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed counterpart. 

   

 Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be interpreted, governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly-performed within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the Chapter 11 Court. Each of the parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

   

 Section 10.7 _Publicity_. Neither Seller nor Buyers shall, and neither Seller nor Buyers shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of Buyers, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Seller, or Seller, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Buyers; provided, however, that either party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement to the extent required by law or by the rules and regulations of the NYSE. 

   

 Section 10.8 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. (a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by either of the parties (other than by either Buyer by operation of law in a merger of such Buyer) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement (including the documents

not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies under this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with this Agreement without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

   

 Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the Chapter 11 Court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
