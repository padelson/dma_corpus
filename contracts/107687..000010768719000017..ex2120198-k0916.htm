fifth Business Day before the Closing Date, Sellers and the Acquired Companies
will deliver to Buyer a (i) written statement (the "Estimated Purchase Price
Calculation Statement") setting forth, in reasonable detail, Sellers' and the

Working Capital, (B) the Closing Cash, (C) the Closing Indebtedness, (D) the
Closing Tax Adjustment, and (E) the Company Transaction Expenses, (ii)
Sellers' and the Acquired Companies' resulting good faith estimate of the
Aggregate Purchase Price (the "Estimated Purchase Price"); and (iii) a
schedule (the "Payment Schedule") setting forth (A) each Seller's pro rata
share of the Estimated Purchase Price, the Aggregate Escrow Amount and the
Seller Agent Account (as apportioned for each Seller based on their respective
ownership of the Acquired Companies as set forth on Schedule 2.6), (B) the
amount of the Remaining Estimated Purchase Price due to each Seller, in each
case based on their respective ownership of the Acquired Companies and the
accounts to which the Remaining Estimated Purchase Price shall be paid by
Buyer to each Seller at the

Seller, in each case taking into account the purchase price paid by the Buyer
to each Seller for such Seller's respective capital stock in Newmar

for each Seller being such Seller's "Pro Rata Percentage"). Sellers and the
Acquired Companies shall consider in good faith, and consult with Buyer
regarding, any comments on the Estimated Purchase Price Calculation Statement

Closing Date. The Payment Schedule sets forth the format for the calculation
of the amounts described in this Section 2.2. The Estimated Purchase Price
Calculation Statement will be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no
liability for any allocation of the Aggregate Purchase Price (including the
cash and equity components) among the Sellers as set forth in the Payment
Schedule and each Seller confirms that the Payment Schedule reflects the
agreed upon distribution of the Estimated Purchase Price and consideration to
be paid by Buyer among the Sellers regardless of any inconsistencies with the
Acquired Companies' Organizational Documents.

2.3 Closing. Subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions precedent
set forth in Article 7, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Faegre Baker

on a date (the "Closing Date") to be mutually agreed upon by Sellers and
Buyer, which date will be no later than the third Business Day after all of
the conditions set forth in Article 7 have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions which by their terms are intended to be satisfied at
Closing); provided that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time that
all of the conditions set forth in Article 7 have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions which by their terms are intended to be satisfied
at Closing), then the Closing will occur on the earlier of (a) a Business Day
during the Marketing Period specified by Buyer on no less than five Business
Days' notice to Sellers Agent and (b) the fifth Business Day following the
final day of the Marketing Period, subject in each case of clauses (a) and (b)
to satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 7 for
the Closing on such date. Documents may be delivered at the Closing by
electronic delivery, and the receiving Party may rely on the receipt of such
documents so delivered as if the original had been received. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, all proceedings to be taken and all
documents to be executed at the Closing will be deemed to have been taken,
delivered, and executed simultaneously, and no proceeding will be deemed taken
nor documents deemed executed or delivered until all have been taken,
delivered, and executed. The Closing will be deemed to be effective as of
12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time").

2.4 Payment of Estimated Purchase Price.

(iv) cause Buyer Parent to issue and deliver to certain Sellers, in the
applicable Seller's name, in book entry, the Closing Stock Consideration, as

the Equity Agreements); and

(v) pay or cause to be paid the remaining balance of the Estimated Purchase
Price (after making the payments in Sections 2.4(a)(i), (ii), and (iii) and
deducting the value of the Closing Stock Consideration in Section 2.4(a)(iv),
the "Remaining Estimated Purchase Price") to Sellers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to in the amounts and to the accounts set forth on
the Payment Schedule.

2.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Buyer's Preparation of the Statement. Within 90 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sellers Agent a statement (the "Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement") setting forth, in reasonable detail,
Buyer's calculations ("Buyer's Proposed Calculations") of (i) the amount of
the Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) Closing Cash, (iii) Closing
Indebtedness, (iv) the Final Tax Adjustment, and (v) Company Transaction
Expenses, and (v) the resulting Aggregate Purchase Price. Buyer's Proposed
Calculations shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(b) Objections; Resolution of Disputes.

(i) Unless Sellers Agent notifies Buyer in writing within 30 days after
Buyer's delivery of the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement of any
objection to the Buyer's Proposed Calculations (the "Notice of Objection"),
the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement will become final and binding
on the Parties at the end of such 30-day period. During such 30-day period,
Sellers Agent and Sellers Agent's representatives and advisors will be
provided with reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to all materials and
information used by Buyer in preparing the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement and Buyer will make available such personnel as are reasonably
necessary to assist Sellers Agent in its review of the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement. Any Notice of Objection must specify in reasonable
detail the basis for the objections set forth therein.

(ii) If Sellers Agent provides the Notice of Objection to Buyer within such
30-day period, Buyer and Sellers Agent will, during the 30-day period
following Buyer's receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to
resolve the objections of Sellers Agent. During such 30-day period, Buyer and
its independent auditors and other representatives and their advisors will be
permitted to review the working papers of the Sellers Agent and, if
applicable, his representatives relating to the Notice of Objection and the
basis therefor. If Buyer and Sellers Agent are unable to resolve all such
objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining in dispute that
were properly included in the Notice of Objection will be submitted to Ernst
and Young LLP (or, if such firm declines to act, to another nationally
recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers
Agent in writing and, if Buyer and Sellers Agent are unable to so agree within
10 days after the end of such 30-day period, then Buyer and Sellers Agent will
each select such a



firm and such firms will jointly select a third nationally recognized firm to
resolve the disputed matters (such selected firm being the "Independent
Accounting Firm")). Buyer and Sellers Agent will instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm to render its reasoned written decision as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than 30 days after its selection. The
Independent Accounting Firm will act as an arbitrator to resolve the disputed
matters solely based on submissions made by Sellers Agent and Buyer that are
consistent with the terms of this Agreement (and not by independent review).
The Independent Accounting Firm will be bound by the terms of this Agreement,
including the Accounting Principles, and will not assign a value to any item
that is greater than the greater value for such item claimed by either Party
or less than the lesser value for such item claimed by either Party. The
resolution of disputed items by the Independent Accounting Firm will be final
and binding, and the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm will
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction over the
Party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be apportioned between the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the
inverse proportion of the amount of the disputed items on the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement resolved in favor of such Party (i.e., so that the
prevailing Party bears a lesser amount of such fees and expenses), with the
amount of fees payable by Sellers being distributed from the Aggregate
Purchase Price Adjustment Account or, if there are not sufficient funds
remaining in such account, then paid jointly and severally by Sellers. The
Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement, as adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.5(b)(ii), will be final and binding on the Parties.

(c) Adjustment Payment. Upon determination, in accordance with Section 2.5(b),
of the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement and the final calculations
of the items to be included therein under Section 2.5(a), the Aggregate
Purchase Price will be recalculated using such finally determined amounts. The
following payments, if any, will be deemed to be adjustments to the Aggregate
Purchase Price for all purposes.

(i) If the Aggregate Purchase Price (as recalculated under this Section
2.5(c)) is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer will pay or
cause to be paid, no later than three Business Days after the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement becomes final and binding under Section 2.5(b), to
Sellers in accordance with the Payment Schedule (allocated in accordance with
each Seller's Pro Rata Percentage) and the Wire Transfer Instructions, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of such excess over the
Estimated Purchase Price.

(ii) (1) If the Aggregate Purchase Price (as recalculated under this Section
2.5(c)) is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Sellers Agent and
Buyer will provide joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to release an amount
equal to the amount of any deficiency from the Estimated Purchase Price to
Buyer from the Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment Account and (2) any amount
remaining in the Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment Account (if any) after
the payment in clause (1) of this subsection, to Sellers in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Percentages. If the value of such deficiency exceeds
the amount in the Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment Account, the Sellers
Agent and Buyer shall execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent directing that the entire amount of the Aggregate Purchase Price
Adjustment Account be release to Buyer and the remaining deficiency shall be
paid by the Sellers to the Buyer in accordance with their Pro Rata
Percentages.



(iii) If the Aggregate Purchase Price (as recalculated under this Section
2.5(c)) is equal to or greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then no
payment will be made to Buyer from the Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment
Account and, no later than three Business Days after the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement becomes final and binding under Section 2.5(b), Sellers
Agent and Buyer will provide joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to release
the amount remaining in the Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment Account to
Sellers, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages.

2.6 Allocation of Aggregate Purchase Price and Seller Basis Calculation.

(a) Within 60 days of the Closing Date, the Sellers Agent shall deliver to the
Buyer a calculation of the tax basis of the assets of Newmar Corporation, New-
Way Transport and New-Serv (the "Basis Calculation"). Buyer shall have the
right to review such Basis Calculation and if Buyer disagrees with such Basis
Calculation, Buyer will notify Sellers Agent in writing within 10 days after
receipt of the Basis Calculation. If Sellers Agent and Buyer are unable to
reach an agreement regarding the Basis Calculation, then within 10 days
following Sellers Agent's receipt of the Basis Calculation, any disagreement
will be resolved by applying the procedures and principles of Section
2.5(b)(ii). The Basis Calculation, as prepared by Sellers Agent if no timely
Buyer objection has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between
the parties, or as determined pursuant to the decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii) will be final (the "Final Basis
Calculation"). Any fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be
borne equally by the Parties.

(b) The Aggregate Purchase Price shall be allocated among the equity interests
of Newmar Corporation, Dutch, New-Way Transport, and New-Serv as set forth in
Schedule 2.6. Buyer will prepare an allocation of the Aggregate Purchase
Price (and the liabilities of the Acquired Companies and any other relevant
items), consistent with Schedule 2.6, which will be allocated among the assets
of the Acquired Companies as required pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Allocation"),
and deliver such Allocation to Sellers Agent within 90 days following the
Closing Date. Sellers Agent will have the right to review such Allocation and,
to the extent Sellers Agent disagrees with the Allocation, Sellers Agent will
notify Buyer in writing, within 30 days after receipt of such Allocation of
any objections. If Sellers Agent and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement
regarding the Allocation, then within 20 days following Buyer's receipt of
Sellers Agent's objection, any disagreement will be resolved by applying the
procedures and principles of Section 2.5(b)(ii). The Allocation, as prepared
by Buyer if no timely Sellers Agent objection has been given, as adjusted
pursuant to any agreement between the parties, or as determined pursuant to
the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii)
will be final (the "Final Allocation"). Any fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant will be borne equally by the Parties. Buyer and Sellers
Agent will cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments and
schedules necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including
IRS Form 8023 and 8883 and any similar forms under applicable state and local
Income Tax laws (collectively, the "Section 338 Forms") in a manner consistent
with the Final Allocation. Buyer and Sellers will, or will cause their
relevant Affiliates to timely file such Section 338 Forms with the applicable
Governmental Authorities. Sellers and Buyer agree that none of them will, or
will permit any of their Affiliates to, revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Election
following the filing of the Section 338 Forms without the prior written
consent of Sellers Agent or Buyer, as the case may be. Except to the extent
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of section 1313(a)
of the Code, neither Sellers, any Acquired Company, nor Buyer will take any
position inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the Section 338
Forms, provided, however,



that post-Closing adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price will be
reflected as permitted by Applicable Law.

2.7 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and
for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made net of any Taxes required by Applicable Law to be deducted or
withheld from such payment and (b) any amounts deducted or withheld from any
such payment shall be remitted to the applicable taxing authority and shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid.

ARTICLE 3 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS AND ACQUIRED COMPANIES

Except as disclosed in the corresponding Section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by Sellers concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"), Sellers and the Acquired Companies
hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer, as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date, as follows:

3.1 Organization and Good Standing. Each Acquired Company is a duly organized
and validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it was organized. Each Acquired Company is duly
qualified and in good standing to do business as a foreign corporation or
limited liability company (as applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership or leasing of its properties or assets or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to one or more of the Acquired Companies. Each Acquired
Company has full corporate power and authority to own and lease its properties
and assets and conduct its business as now conducted. Other than the Newmar
Corporation's direct ownership of Newmar International and Newmar Risk
Management, no Acquired Company holds any equity interest, directly or
indirectly, of any other Person. Sellers and Newmar Corporation have made
available to Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of the Organizational
Documents of each Acquired Company and Company Subsidiary and there are no
breaches of such Organizational Documents.

3.2 Capitalization.

stock, (iv) the Sellers' respective ownership percentages and shareholdings of
(including stock ledgers showing) all the issued and outstanding capital stock
of Newmar Corporation, Dutch, New-Way Transport, and New-Serv, which together
constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Newmar
Corporation, Dutch, New-Way Transport, and New-Serv, and (v) the record owners
and the number of shares of each class or series of capital stock in each of
the Company Subsidiaries that are issued and outstanding, together with the
registered holders thereof. All the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Acquired Companies and all the outstanding shares of each class or series
of capital stock of each of the Company Subsidiaries have been duly authorized
and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive or subscription rights. There are no options,
calls, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities, or conversion,
preemptive, subscription, or other rights, or agreements, arrangements or
commitments, in any such case, obligating or which may obligate any Acquired
Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, sell, purchase, return or redeem
any shares of its capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for any capital stock or to grant any options, calls, warrants or convertible
or exchangeable securities, or conversion,



preemptive, subscription, or other rights, or agreements, arrangements or
commitments. There are no shares of capital stock of any Acquired Company or
Company Subsidiary reserved for issuance. There are no capital appreciation
rights, restricted stock or equity, performance-based stock or other equity,
dividend equivalent, profit participation, phantom stock or equity plans,
securities with participation rights or features or similar obligations and
commitments of any Acquired Company or any Company Subsidiary. Sellers have
good and valid title to all Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other
than any Encumbrances arising as a result of this Agreement or restrictions on
transfer imposed by Applicable Laws. Newmar Corporation directly owns all the
outstanding capital stock of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear
of all Encumbrances, other than any Encumbrances arising as a result of this
Agreement or restrictions on transfer imposed by Applicable Laws. Other than
Newmar Corporation's ownership of the capital stock of the Company
Subsidiaries, no Acquired Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries owns,
holds or controls, directly or indirectly, any equity, partnership, membership
or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable for the
purchase of or exchangeable for any such equity, partnership, membership or
similar interest in, any Person. There are no declared or accrued unpaid
dividends or distributions with respect to any shares of capital stock of any
Acquired Company or Company Subsidiary. No Acquired Company or Company
Subsidiary is under any obligation to register under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, any of its presently outstanding shares of stock or other
securities or any stock or other securities that may be subsequently issued.

(b) Except for this Agreement and as set forth on Section 3.2 of the
Disclosure Schedule and restrictions imposed by Applicable Laws, there are no
agreements, voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other rights or
agreements in effect with respect to the voting, transfer or distribution
rights of the Shares or of the capital stock in any Company Subsidiary. From
June 13, 2019 to the date hereof, no Acquired Company has declared, set aside,
made or paid any distribution in respect of the Shares.

3.3 Authority and Authorization; Conflicts; Consents.

Company Subsidiary, and Seller, enforceable against such Acquired Company,
Company Subsidiary and Seller in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent enforceability may be limited by any Enforcement Limitation.

of filings and submissions referenced in the next sentence, neither the
execution nor delivery by any Acquired Company or Seller of this Agreement or
of any Ancillary Document nor consummation by any Acquired Company or Seller
of the transactions contemplated herein or therein does or will (with or

any Organizational Document of any Seller, any Acquired Company or any Company
Subsidiary; (ii) violate any Applicable Law; (iii) constitute



a breach or violation of or a default under, conflict with or give rise to or

Encumbrance on the Shares. No consent or approval by, notification to or

approval by, notification to or filing with any Governmental Authority is
required, in each case, in connection with each Seller's and each Acquired

each Major Contract (or, in the case of any oral Major Contract, an accurate
summary of the material terms thereof). With respect to each Major Contract
(and with the following assuming that each Consent is obtained, which, for any
Consent that is a filing or notice, means the making of such filing or
notice), (i) such Major Contract is in full force and effect and is
enforceable in accordance with its terms against the Acquired Company or
Company Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the Acquired Companies'
Knowledge, against each other party thereto, except in each case to the extent
enforceability may be limited by any Enforcement Limitation, (ii) such

Balance Sheet or acquired by it after the Interim Balance Sheet Date
(collectively, the "Assets"), free and clear of any Encumbrance other than any
Permitted Encumbrance, except for any asset disposed of in its Ordinary Course
of Business since the Interim Balance Sheet Date. Any Permitted Encumbrances
on the Assets, individually or in the aggregate, do not materially interfere
with the current use of any such Asset by the Business or materially detract
from the value of any such Asset. All material tangible personal property
owned or leased by the Acquired Companies is in such working condition and
state of repair sufficient to permit the use of such personal property as used
in its business as currently conducted (ordinary maintenance, wear and tear

licenses, rights and other appurtenances relating thereto, being "Owned Real
Property"); and (ii) the address, landlord and the Acquired Company that is
the tenant of each real property leased, possessed, used or otherwise occupied

use and/or occupancy together with any amendments thereto and any guarantees
thereof, being a "Real Property Lease"; any real property leased, possessed,
used or occupied under a Real Property Lease (or that any Acquired Company has
a right to lease or occupy) being "Leased Real Property") and any building,
structure or other



fixture or improvement owned by any Acquired Company that is located at the
Leased Real Property being "Leasehold Improvements"). The Owned Real Property,
the Leased Real Property and the Leasehold Improvements are, collectively, the
"Real Property."

(b) All of the land, buildings, structures and other improvements used by or
held for use by any Acquired Company in the conduct of the Business are
included in the Real Property. The use, occupancy and/or operation of the Real

violate, in any material respect, any Applicable Law, Permit or Encumbrance.
The Real Property is in good operating condition (ordinary wear and tear
excepted), and none of the Real Property has suffered any material damage by
fire or other casualty which has not been restored or repaired to

materially interferes with the operation of the Business conducted at such
Leased Real Property. No Acquired Company is in default or otherwise in breach
under any Real Property Lease and, to Seller's Knowledge, no other party is in
default or otherwise in breach thereof. Seller has provided to Buyer a true,
correct and complete copy of each Real Property Lease (including without
limitation all amendments and supplements thereto and all estoppel
certificates, subordination and non-disturbance agreements and similar
instruments that would preclude assertion of any claim under any Real Property
Lease, affect any right or obligation under any Real Property Lease or
otherwise be binding upon any successor to the applicable Acquired Company's
position under any Real Property Lease). Each Real Property Lease is in full
force and effect and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
thereto, and there are no other agreements, whether oral or written, between
such parties.

(e) The relevant Acquired Company has good, valid and marketable fee simple
title to all Owned Real Property, and good and valid title to all Leasehold

compliance with all Applicable Laws and all applicable insurance requirements,

company) not located on the Real Property to fulfill any zoning, building code
or other requirement under any Applicable Law.



(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
or performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will,
directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time) contravene,

submission for renewal of any such Permit.

provision of the Healthcare Reform Laws.

properties and assets and conduct its business. Each Buyer Entity is duly
qualified and in good standing to do business as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership and leasing of its properties and assets
or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing will not materially and
adversely affect that Buyer Entity's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

4.2 Authority and Authorization; Conflicts; Consents.

(a) Authority and Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Document of each Buyer Entity has been duly
authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action with respect to that
Buyer Entity, and each such authorization and approval remains in full force
and effect. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Sellers of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Document, this Agreement is, and each



Ancillary Document of each Buyer Entity at Closing will be, the legal, valid
and binding obligation of such Buyer Entity, enforceable against such Buyer
Entity in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may
be limited by any Enforcement Limitation.

(b) Conflicts; Consents. Subject to the receipt of the Consents and the making
of filings and submissions referenced in the next sentence, neither the
execution nor delivery by either Buyer Entity of this Agreement or of any
Ancillary Document nor consummation by either Buyer Entity of the transactions
contemplated herein or therein does or will (with or without the passage of
time or giving of notice): (i) constitute a breach of, violate, conflict with
or give rise to or create any right or obligation under any Organizational
Document of either Buyer Entity; (ii) violate any Applicable Law; or (iii)
constitute a breach or violation of or a default under, conflict with or give
rise to or create any right of any Person other than a Buyer Entity to
accelerate, increase, terminate, modify or cancel any material right or
obligation in a manner adverse to a Buyer Entity under any Contract to which a
Buyer Entity is a party, except where such a breach, violation, default,
conflict or right under clause (ii) or (iii) above will not materially and
adversely affect either Buyer Entity's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. No consent or approval by, notification to or
filing with any Person is required in connection with either Buyer Entity's
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document
of such Buyer Entity or the consummation by the Buyer Entities of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein, except (1) as required by
Antitrust Laws, or (2) for any consent, approval, notice or filing, the
absence of which will not materially and adversely affect the Buyer Entities'
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.3 Litigation and Orders. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge
of either Buyer Entity, threatened against either Buyer Entity as of the date
of this Agreement that, if decided adversely to a Buyer Entity, will
materially and adversely affect such Buyer Entity's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Buyer Entity is subject to an Order that will materially and adversely
affect such Buyer Entity's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement.

4.4 Financing.

(a) The Buyer Entities have delivered to Sellers Agent complete and correct
copies of: (i) a fully executed commitment letter (the "Debt Commitment
Letter") from the financial institutions named therein, pursuant to which such
financial institutions have committed, upon the terms and subject only to the
conditions set forth therein, to provide the debt financing described therein
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) a
fully executed fee letter references in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Fee
Letter") (provided that the Fee Letter has been redacted in a customary
manner). The Debt Commitment Letter and, as the context requires, any other
debt commitment letter executed pursuant to Section 5.14(c) are hereinafter
referred to together as the "Debt Commitment Letters." The financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters is hereinafter referred to as the
"Debt Financing."

(b) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Buyer and, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto and enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms against Buyer Parent and, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, each of the other parties thereto, except to the extent enforceability
may be limited by any Enforcement Limitation. All commitment fees and other
fees required to be paid thereunder on or prior to the date hereof have been
paid in full, and each Buyer Entity has otherwise satisfied all of the other
terms and conditions required to be satisfied by it pursuant to the terms of



the Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to the date hereof. The Debt
Commitment Letters have not been amended, modified, withdrawn or terminated in
any respect on or prior to the date hereof, and no such amendment,
modification or termination is contemplated as of the date hereof other than
as would not require a consent or waiver under this Agreement (provided that
the existence or exercise of "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter
shall not constitute an amendment or modification of the Debt Commitment
Letters). As of the date hereof no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material breach or default
by either Buyer Entity or any of their respective Affiliates thereunder or, to
the Knowledge of Buyer, otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable. The consummation of the Debt Financing
and the obligation of the parties under the Commitment Letters to make the
full amount of the Debt Financing available to Buyer Parent at the Closing are
subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the
copies of the Commitment Letters delivered to Sellers Agent. As of the date
hereof, there are no side letters or other Contracts or legally binding
arrangements that could adversely affect the funding of the Debt Financing.
Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article 3 and the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 7.1 and Section
7.2, as of the date hereof, neither Buyer Entity has any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be
consummated and available in full on or before the date of the Closing. The
aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the
Debt Commitment Letters, will be sufficient to enable the Buyer Entities to
perform their obligations hereunder and to make all payments contemplated by
this Agreement to be made by them, including payment of the Aggregate Purchase
Price, the other amounts contemplated in Section 2.4, and all fees and
expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be paid by them, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 7.1
and Section 7.2 and the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in Article 3.

4.5 Securities. Buyer is acquiring the Shares hereunder for investment, solely
for Buyer's own account and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution or other disposition thereof in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities law. Buyer acknowledges that
none of the Shares may be resold in the absence of registration, or the
availability of an exemption from such registration, under the Securities Act
or any applicable state securities law. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act and has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Shares. Buyer has had
access to sufficient information regarding each Acquired Company and its
business and condition to make an informed decision to purchase the Shares.

4.6 Issuance of Shares. The Closing Stock Consideration to be issued hereunder
will be newly issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than those
arising under securities Laws and pursuant to the Equity Agreements), and will
not be issued in violation of any preemptive right, purchase option, call
option, right of first refusal or similar options or rights or in violation of
the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. Buyer Parent has
and on the Closing Date will have a sufficient number of shares of common
stock authorized for issuing the Closing Stock Consideration.

4.7 SEC Filings and NYSE Listing.

(a) Buyer Parent has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") all registration statements, proxy statements and other statements,
reports, schedules, forms and other documents (including all exhibits and all
other information incorporated by reference) required to be filed by it with
the



SEC (the "Parent SEC Documents"), and all amendments thereto. To Buyer's
Knowledge, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC
review and there are no inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal
investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting
practices of Buyer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. All required statements,
reports, schedules, forms and other documents required to have been filed by
Buyer Parent with the SEC have been so filed. As of the time it was filed with
the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing) (i) each of the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as it may be amended
from time to time and (ii) none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

misleading.

("NYSE"). Buyer Parent is in material compliance with the listing standards of
the NYSE. To Buyer's Knowledge, there are no inquiries or investigations by
the NYSE pending or threatened, in each case regarding the Buyer Parent's
compliance with the NYSE listing standards that may reasonably result in
suspension of trading or delisting of the Parent's common stock from the NYSE.

4.8 Brokers. Neither Buyer Entity has any Liability to any broker, finder or
similar intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated herein
that would cause any Acquired Company or any Seller to become liable for
payment of any fee or expense with respect thereto.

Closing, subject to the Nondisclosure Agreement, Sellers and the Acquired
Companies will (i) furnish (or cause to be furnished) to Buyer and Buyer's
representatives (including its legal counsel and accountants) books and
records, additional financial and operating data and other information
relating to the Business as Buyer reasonably requests, and (ii) permit (or
cause the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries to permit) Buyer and
Buyer's representatives (including its legal counsel and accountants) to have
reasonable access to all premises, properties, personnel, books and records,
properties, contracts and other documents relating to the Acquired Companies
and their Subsidiaries, subject to any requirements of Applicable Laws
regarding privacy. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall
affect, add to or subtract from any warranties of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer and Buyer's representatives will conduct such
investigation and be granted such access after reasonable notice in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Acquired
Companies and their Subsidiaries.

(b) Notification of Certain Matters. Sellers shall give prompt notice to Buyer
of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty
of Sellers contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing, or (ii) any material failure of Sellers to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by them under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Buyer or its Affiliates or the
conditions to Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing.

(c) Post-Closing Access for Sellers.

(i) Until the later of (i) the extinguishment of the statute of limitations
for assessment of Taxes related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) the
completion of any Tax audits or



Tax contests involving a Pre-Closing Tax Period, subject to Buyer's reasonable
confidentiality precautions, Buyer will, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice from Sellers: (1) cause Sellers' Agent and his
representatives to have reasonable access to the pre‑Closing books and records
(including financial and Tax records, Tax Returns, files, papers and related
items) of the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries, and to the
appropriate personnel responsible for preparing and maintaining such books and
records, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) reasonably
necessary to (A) defend or pursue any third party Proceeding, (B) defend
Third-Party Claim indemnification matters hereunder, (C) prepare or audit
financial statements, (D) prepare or file Tax Returns, (E) respond to any
investigation or other inquiry by or under the control of any Governmental
Authority, or (F) address other pre-Closing Tax, accounting, financial or
legal matters; and (2) permit Sellers' Agent and his representatives to make
copies of such books and records for the foregoing purposes.

(ii) Any exercise by Sellers' Agent and his representatives of the rights set
forth in this Section 5.4(c) shall be at Sellers' sole cost and expense and at
Sellers' sole risk. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
Buyer, the Acquired Companies, and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates shall be required to provide any access, assistance or cooperation
to the extent providing such access, assistance or cooperation would unduly
interfere with the business or operations of any of Buyer, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, or would, in the
reasonable judgment of Buyer or its Affiliates, violate or jeopardize any
applicable attorney-client or other privilege or any applicable contractual
confidentiality obligation.

5.5 Further Assurances. If after Closing any further action is necessary,
proper or desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each
Party will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
further documents) as any other Party reasonably requests to carry out such
purpose. The foregoing will be at the expense of such requesting Party, except
to the extent such requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor or
to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates such expense to any other
Party.

5.6 Confidentiality and Publicity.

(a) Nondisclosure Agreement. Subject to the other terms of this Section 5.6,
each Party acknowledges that the information being furnished or made available
to it in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements is subject to the terms of the Nondisclosure
Agreement between Buyer Parent and Newmar Corporation, dated as of April 4,
2019 (the "Nondisclosure Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Nondisclosure Agreement will terminate with respect to information relating
exclusively to the Acquired Companies.

(b) Sellers will treat and hold as such all of the Confidential Information,
refrain from using any of the Confidential Information except in connection
with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to Buyer or destroy, at the option
of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential
Information that are in their possession, except for a securely maintained
electronically archived copy the return or destruction of which is not
practicable. In the event that Sellers are requested or required pursuant to
written or oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process to disclose any Confidential Information, Sellers will (to the extent
not prohibited by law) notify Buyer reasonably promptly of the request or
requirement so that Buyer may seek (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of



this Section 5.6(b). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt
of a waiver hereunder, Sellers are, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for
contempt, Sellers may disclose only such Confidential Information to the
tribunal; provided, however, that Sellers will use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain, at the request of Buyer (at Buyer's sole cost
and expense), an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Buyer will designate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers
shall be permitted to make disclosures concerning the Confidential Information
(x) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any Tax Return filed
by Sellers, (y) to the extent such information was or becomes available to
such Seller from a third party who is not known to such Seller to be bound by
an obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto, and (z) to the extent
reasonably required during the course of pursuing or defending in good faith
indemnification claims (or the matters underlying such indemnification claims)
or in connection with any dispute between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers
or Sellers' Agent, on the other. The foregoing provisions will not apply to
any Confidential Information that is generally available to the public
immediately prior to the time of disclosure unless such Confidential
Information is so available due to the wrongful actions of Sellers.

(c) Publicity. Buyer may issue a press release and file a Current Report on
Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with
the signing of this Agreement, subject to the approval of Sellers' Agent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Except for
such press release and Current Report on Form 8-K, none of Buyer, Sellers the
Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates will issue any press release
or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement prior to Closing without the prior approval of Sellers' Agent and
Buyer, except as may be required by Applicable Law. Following the Closing,
neither Sellers nor their respective Affiliates will issue any press release
or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement without the prior written approval of Buyer, except as may be
required by Applicable Law.

5.7 Employee Matters.

(a) Employee Benefits. Throughout the one‑year period after Closing, Buyer
will, or will cause one or more of Buyer's Affiliates (including any Acquired
Company) to, provide to each employee of an Acquired Company employee welfare
and retirement benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
employee welfare and retirement benefits received by the employees (and their
dependents) as employees of an Acquired Company immediately before Closing.
Without limiting any obligation already existing, for purposes of eligibility
and vesting for all benefits (other than any equity incentive plan or for any
grandfathered plan purpose) and for purposes of entitlement to vacation, sick
leave, paid time off, severance and similar benefits, Buyer will cause each
employee of an Acquired Company to be given or retain (as applicable) full
credit under the employee benefits of Buyer and its Affiliates (including any
Acquired Company) after Closing for such employee's service with any Acquired
Company before Closing. Except to the extent the consent of a third party,
such as an insurer, is required and such consent cannot be obtained through
commercially reasonable efforts, (i) each such employee (and such dependent)
will be allowed to participate in such employee benefits without regard to
preexisting conditions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other
exclusions or limitations not imposed on such individual by, or which were
otherwise satisfied under, any Acquired Company's employee benefit
arrangements before Closing and (ii) Buyer will apply or credit (or cause to
be applied or credited) toward any deductible requirements under all welfare
benefit Plans all amounts paid by employees (or dependents) under the welfare
benefit Plans of any Acquired Company during the Company Plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs to the same



extent such credit was given for the year under the Plan in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) No Amendment of Benefits nor Third‑Party Beneficiary, Etc. Without
limiting Section 9.4, (i) no Company Plan or other employee benefit or
arrangement is or will be deemed to be amended by any term hereof and (ii) no
Person, including any employee (or dependent or beneficiary thereof) of any
Acquired Company or participant in any Company Plan, is a third party
beneficiary of any term of this Section 5.7. Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall
obligate the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any
employee of the Acquired Companies or any of their Subsidiaries following the
Closing for any specific period or in any specific level of employment, except
as may be required by Applicable Law.

5.8 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Filing Responsibility. Sellers will timely prepare and file or cause each
Acquired Company to timely prepare and file at the expense of the Sellers all
Tax Returns of or including any Acquired Company that are required to be filed
(with extensions) on or before the Closing Date and to pay all Taxes shown as
due on any such Tax Return. All such Tax Returns will be made and filed by the
Sellers or the Acquired Companies in a manner consistent with the most recent
prior practice of the Acquired Companies and with Applicable Law except that
the Income Tax Tax Returns for the period that ends on the Closing Date will
reflect 338(h)(10) Elections and deductible expenses attributable to the
Acquired Companies to the extent allowed by Applicable Law and in accordance
with past practices of Sellers. Sellers Agent will, at the expense of Sellers,
prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns of each
Acquired Company and each of the Acquired Companies' Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date. Each party (or parties) responsible for preparing and
filing any Income Tax Tax Return pursuant to this Section 5.9(a), shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments of the other party (or parties)
in respect of such Income Tax Tax Return, provided that all Company
Transaction Expenses borne by Sellers will be deemed attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. The parties
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect to any such
Income Tax Tax Return and if the parties are unable to resolve any such
dispute at least ten days before the due date (including extensions) for any
such Income Tax Tax Return, the dispute shall be referred to an accounting
firm of international reputation mutually agreeable to Sellers and Buyer (the
"Tax Accountant") and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be
final. If any such dispute is not resolved by the Tax Accountant prior to the
due date (including extensions) for any such Income Tax Tax Return, such
Income Tax Tax Return shall be filed as originally prepared and later amended
to reflect the Tax Accountant's determination, if necessary. The expenses of
the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer and Sellers.

(b) 338(h)(10) Elections. Sellers and Buyer will make the election pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the acquisition of Newmar
Corporation, and, if permissible, similar elections under any applicable
state, municipal, local or Income Tax laws, as Buyer may reasonably specify
(collectively, the "338(h)(10) Election"). Sellers and Newmar Corporation will
not, and Sellers will cause Newmar Corporation not to, before Closing, (1)
revoke its election to be taxed as an S corporation within the meaning of Code
Sections 1361 and 1362 or (2) take any action that would result in the
termination of Newmar Corporation's status as a validly existing S corporation
within the meaning of Code Sections 1361 and 1362. Buyer and all Sellers each
will deliver to the other Party at Closing duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that
reflect the 338(h)(10) Election and will file such forms in accordance with
Applicable Law.



(c) Cooperation. Buyer, Sellers, Sellers Agent and the Acquired Companies will
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return pursuant to
this Section 5.9 and the defense of any audit, litigation or other Proceeding
with respect to Taxes of the Acquired Companies. Sellers and Buyer agree to,
and to cause each Acquired Company to (i) abide by any and all record
retention requirements of, or record retention agreements entered into with,
any Tax authority and (ii) retain (and provide the other Party and its
Affiliates with reasonable access to) all records or information which may be
relevant to the preparation of any Tax Return or claim for refund and the
defense of any audit, litigation or Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Acquired Companies. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse
the other for any reasonable out of pocket costs incurred in providing any
information pursuant to this Section 5.9(c) and shall compensate the other
party for any reasonable costs (excluding wages, salaries and related costs)
of making personnel available, upon receipt of reasonable documentation of
such costs. To the extent that action by Sellers, Buyer or any company
controlled by Sellers or Buyer is required by Applicable Laws or
administrative pronouncements in order to extend any statute of limitation for
any Tax Return or Proceeding described above in this Section 5.9(c), such
party will take such action as is necessary to extend a statute of limitations
where such extension is reasonably requested by the other party in connection
with the preparation by such other party of such Tax Return or defense by such
other party of such Proceeding.

(d) Straddle Period. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods will (i) in the case of any real or personal
property Taxes or similar ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period and
(ii) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date

(e) Refunds. Sellers will be entitled to any refund or credit with respect to
any Tax for which Sellers are liable under this Agreement (plus any interest
received, by payment or credit, with respect thereto) and Buyer will file (or
cause to be filed) any claims for any such refund or credit reasonably
requested by Sellers Agent and shall pay over the amount of such refund of
credit to Sellers, less Buyer's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with obtaining such refund and less any Taxes incurred by Buyer, its
Affiliates, or any Acquired Company in connection with the receipt of such
refund or interest if such refunds are received by Buyer or any Acquired
Company. Except to the extent stated in this Section 5.9, Buyer will be
entitled to any refund or credit with respect to any Tax attributable to any
Acquired Company (plus any interest received, by payment or credit, with
respect thereto). Each Party will promptly forward to the proper Party, or
reimburse the proper Party for, any refund or credit due such proper Party
after receipt thereof.

(f) Transfer Taxes. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, will
pay half of all Transfer Taxes, if any, and Sellers and Buyer will cooperate
in timely making all filings, returns, reports, and forms as may be required
to comply with the provisions of Applicable Law relating thereto.

(g) Overlap. To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 5.9 and
Article 8, this Section 5.9 shall control as to Tax matters.

5.9 No Shop. Throughout the period that begins on the date hereof and ends
upon the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.3, no Seller or Acquired



Company will, and Sellers will cause each Acquired Company and each authorized
representative or agent of Sellers or any Acquired Company not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate, seek, or encourage any inquiry, proposal, or
offer from, furnish any information to, or participate in any discussion or
negotiation or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than the Buyer
Entities or any Person on their behalf) regarding any acquisition of a
substantial portion of any Acquired Company's equity interests, assets, or
business, in whole or in part (by purchase, merger, tender offer, statutory
share exchange, joint venture or otherwise), except the sales of inventory in
the Ordinary Course of Business of the applicable Acquired Company. Sellers
and the Acquired Companies will, and will cause each Acquired Company and each
authorized representative or agent of any Seller or any Acquired Company to,
immediately terminate all such discussions or negotiations that may be in
progress on the date hereof.

5.10 Sellers Agent.

(a) Without any further act of any Seller, Sellers Agent is hereby irrevocably

Neither Sellers Agent nor any of his agents or employees will be liable to any
Person for any error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to
be taken, under this Agreement, except in the case of its bad faith or willful
misconduct. Sellers Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts selected by him and will not be liable for any

accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. As to any
matters not expressly provided for in this Agreement, Sellers Agent will not

indemnify and hold harmless and reimburse Sellers Agent from and against such
Seller's pro rata share (computed on the basis of its Pro Rata Percentage) of
any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, or expenses suffered
or incurred by Sellers Agent arising out of, relating to or resulting from any
action taken or omitted to be taken by Sellers Agent under this Agreement,
other than such Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses

Agent may be filled by approval of a majority of Sellers (computed on the
basis of their respective Pro Rata Percentages). No bond will be required of

and neither Buyer Entity will have any Liability to any Person for any act or
omission by Sellers Agent.

5.11 Debt Financing Commitments.

(a) Obligations; Amendment of Debt Commitment Letters; Alternative Debt
Financing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer
Entities will (and will cause each of their Affiliates to) use commercially

cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and
consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter (including any "flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter) no later than the Closing Date. The Buyer
Entities shall keep the Sellers Agent informed on a reasonable basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.
The Buyer Entities shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made

or the Fee Letter (i) if such amendment, modification or waiver could
reasonably be expected to impact, delay or otherwise adversely affect the
ability of the Buyer Entities to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy adversely
affects in any material respect the conditions of the Debt Financing or the
amount of such Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid in connection therewith or the original issue discount thereof) or (iii)
if such amendment, modification or waiver materially and adversely impacts the
rights of the Buyer Entities against the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter (provided that the Buyer Entities may amend the Debt Commitment Letter
to add or replace additional lenders, bookrunners, agents and other similar
entities). If any portion of the Debt Financing is unavailable in the manner
or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than as
a result of any Acquired Company's breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement), the Buyer Entities will
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing for such
portion from alternative sources on terms and conditions no less favorable in
all material respects than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter.

between appropriate members of senior management of the Acquired Companies, on
the one hand, and prospective lenders and investors, on the other) and

information memoranda, lender presentations, materials, offering memorandum or
similar documents shall be issued by the Sellers or their Affiliates, and (z)
solely with respect to financial information and data derived from the

prohibitive of any general solicitation that is not specifically targeted at
such persons.

(v) During the applicable Non-Compete Period, the Sellers will not, whether on
their own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Person, directly
or indirectly, hire any employee who was employed by any of the Acquired

damage caused by such Seller's violation, including attorney fees and
expenses. In addition to any other relief available to the Acquired Companies
in event of a breach, the Acquired Companies may obtain equitable relief in
the form of temporary and permanent injunction and, where applicable, damages
at law. Such damages may be set-off against amounts otherwise due to such
Seller from any of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or their respective successor and assigns.

(viii) It is expressly understood and agreed that although the Sellers
consider the restrictions contained in this Section 5.12(a) to be reasonable,
if a final judicial determination



is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory of any
restriction or provision contained in this Section 5.12(a) or elsewhere in
this Agreement is unenforceable against any Seller, such provisions of this
Agreement will not be rendered void but will be deemed amended to apply as to
such maximum time and territory and/or such maximum extent as such court may
determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement
is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it
enforceable, such finding will not affect the enforceability of any of the
other restrictions contained herein.

(b) Release.

(i) Each Seller, on behalf of such Seller, such Seller's estate, heirs,
executors, administrators, legal representatives and trusts (as applicable),
and such Seller's successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasing
Persons"), hereby absolutely and unconditionally releases, waives and forever
discharges each Releasee of and from any and all Proceedings, Losses, debts,
sums of money, accounts, bonds, bills, rights, covenants, Contracts,

state or federal, in law or in equity, known or unknown, asserted or
unasserted, suspected or unsuspected, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute or
contingent, which the Releasing Persons ever had or may now have against any
Releasee for, upon, arising out of, based in whole or in part upon, or by
reason of the ownership (or any claimed ownership) by such Seller at any time
at or before the Closing of any equity interest of any Acquired Company, any
Subsidiary or any of their predecessor entities (by merger, asset purchase or
otherwise) (or any other equity interest or right to purchase an equity
interest in an Acquired Company or any Subsidiary) or such Seller's status as
a equityholder of an Acquired Company, in each case arising out of any act or
omission occurring at any time at or before the Closing;

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.12(b)(i), Section
5.12(b)(i) shall not limit, reduce or otherwise affect any right or remedy of
any Seller (1) arising under this Agreement, any other Ancillary Agreement or
any employment agreement with the Acquired Company to which such Seller is a
party or (2) to be indemnified as an officer, director or manager of the
Acquired Company under applicable Law.

(iii) For purposes of Section 5.12(b)(i) "Releasees" shall mean (1) the Buyer
Entities, each Acquired Company and their Subsidiaries and each of their
respective past, present and future Affiliates, related entities and
Subsidiaries, (2) each of the respective past, present and future employees,
officers, directors, managers, members, shareholders, equity holders,
partners, agents, representatives, successors and assigns of the entities
described above, and (3) any company providing insurance to any of the
foregoing in the past, present or future.

5.13 Related Party Matters. Each Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates, as applicable, hereby waives all rights arising under each of
the Shareholder Agreements in connection with the entry by some or all Sellers
into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including all come-along and tag-along
rights, all rights of co-sale and redemption, all rights of first refusal,

stock of any Acquired Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including any
shareholder agreements, purchase agreements, voting



trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings with respect to any such
capital stock, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include each of the
Shareholder Agreements) to be terminated prior to the Closing without any
consideration payable by, or further liability or obligation of or to, Buyer,
the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
and the form and substance of each agreement or instrument pursuant to which
such termination is affected shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer.

on or before January 31, 2020 (the "Outside Date");

(c) by Buyer, if any Seller or Sellers or any Acquired Company or the Acquired

(e) by Buyer or Sellers Agent, if any condition in Section 7.1 becomes

agreements herein or in any Ancillary Document; or

(f) by Sellers Agent if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the
conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and remain satisfied or

those not satisfied solely as a result of the breach by either of the Buyer
Entities of their obligations under this Agreement), (ii) Sellers Agent has
notified Buyer that Sellers are ready, willing and able to consummate the

the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2), and (iii) Buyer

under the preceding clause (g) will be effective upon Buyer's delivery of
written notice to Sellers Agent.

6.4 Effect of Termination. Termination of this Agreement under Section 6.3
will terminate all obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, without
Liability of any Party to any other Party except for the Liability of any

terms of Section 5.6 (Confidentiality and Publicity), Section 6.5 (Buyer
Termination Fee), Section 9.2 (Expenses), Section 9.5 (Governing Law), Section
9.6 (Jurisdiction, Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial), and this Section 6.4.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer under Section 6.3(g), Buyer will
pay to Sellers, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages, a
termination fee of $5,000,000



(the "Buyer Termination Fee"). Any Buyer Termination Fee due will be paid to
Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly, and in any
event within three Business Days, after the date of termination of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, while Sellers may pursue both a grant
of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.3(a) and any other remedy
available to Sellers, under no circumstances will Sellers be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in a
Closing and any portion of the Buyer Termination Fee. In no event shall the
Sellers be entitled to collect the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. The parties further agree that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the monetary remedy set forth in this Section 6.5

against any Buyer Related Party for any Loss suffered in the circumstances in
which a Buyer Termination Fee is payable.

Affiliates or any of its or their Affiliates' former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, agents or
financing sources (including, without limitation, the Financing Sources)
(each, a "Buyer Related Party") arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith
(including the Commitment Letters) or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination and (ii) each of the Sellers and the
Acquired Companies shall cause any Action pending in connection with this
Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in connection herewith
(including the Commitment Letters) or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof), to the extent
maintained by such Seller, Acquired Company or any of their Affiliates against
any Buyer Related Party, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days after the payment of the Buyer Termination
Fee.

ARTICLE 8 
INDEMNIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN DISPUTES

8.1 Indemnification of the Buyer Entities. Subject to the other terms of this
Article 8, from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Entities and their Other
Indemnified Persons from and against all direct and indirect Losses and will
pay to the Buyer Entities and their Other Indemnified Persons the amount of
such Losses to the extent arising or resulting from, related to, or in
connection with, any of the following:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by any
Seller or Acquired Company contained in Article 3 of this Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of any Seller or Acquired Company
contained in this Agreement;

(c) Pre-Closing Taxes;

(d) any Closing Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses, the amount of
which was not otherwise deducted from the Aggregate Purchase Price in
accordance with Article 2;

(e) the Excluded Real Property;

(f) the Newmar International Dissolution and the Newmar Risk Dissolution or
anything related to the pre-Closing ownership, structure, operations, assets,
liabilities, or conduct of the business of Newmar International or Newmar Risk
Management;

(g) fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach;

(h) any of the matters listed on Schedule 8.1(g); or

(i) any Proceeding incident to any of the foregoing.



8.2 Indemnification of Sellers. Subject to the other terms of this Article 8,
from and after the Effective time, the Buyer Entities will jointly and
severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers from and against all
Losses of Sellers and each of their respective Other Indemnified Persons to
the extent arising or resulting from or in connection with any of the
following:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
either Buyer Entity contained in this Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of either Buyer Entity contained
in this Agreement;

(c) fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach by Sellers; or

(d) any Proceeding incident to any of the foregoing.

8.3 Matters Regarding Claims.

(a) Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that each other
Party will be damaged irreparably if this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its terms or otherwise is breached and that, in addition to
its other rights under this Agreement and Applicable Law, a Party will be
entitled to an injunction and other equitable relief (without posting any bond
or other security) to prevent breaches hereof and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and its terms in addition to any other remedy to which such Party
may be entitled hereunder. In particular, each Party recognizes and affirms
that in the event any Sellers breach this Agreement, money damages may be
inadequate and Buyer would have no adequate remedy at law, so that Buyer will
have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its
favor, to seek enforcement of its rights and each other Party's obligations
hereunder not only by action for damages but also by action for specific
performance, injunctive or other equitable relief. Notwithstanding this
Section 8.3(a) or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that Sellers will be entitled to the granting of a decree or
order of specific performance or other equitable relief of the obligations of
the Buyer Entities to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate
the Closing only if (i) all conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section
7.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their
terms are intended to be satisfied at Closing and are capable of being
satisfied at the Closing, or those not satisfied solely as a result of the
breach by either of the Buyer Entities of their obligations under this
Agreement) at the time Section 2.3 contemplated the Closing to occur, (ii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or the Financing Sources have confirmed in
writing that the Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) Sellers have irrevocably
confirmed that if a decree or order of specific performance or other equitable
relief is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then
the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence
will not apply to or otherwise limit the right of Sellers to any other
remedies, including such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable
remedies for obligations other than with respect to the obligations of the
Buyer Entities to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the
Closing.

(b) No Double Recovery. Any Claiming Party will only be entitled to recover
the full amount of a Loss once with respect to any item giving rise to a Loss.

(c) Materiality. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
for purposes of determining whether there is an inaccuracy or that there has
been a breach of any representation or warranty for purposes of Section 8.1(a)
and for calculating Losses in connection therewith, no effect shall be given
to any qualification as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse



Effect" and phrases of similar import contained in any representation or
warranty made in Article 3. For the sake of clarity, an item or occurrence
will be deemed "material" if it results in a Loss, individually or in the
aggregate, of at least $50,000.

(d) Claims Pursuant to Governing Documents. The Sellers shall not be entitled
to, and shall not seek to, recover from any Buyer Entities, Acquired Companies
and Other Indemnified Persons pursuant to claims afforded to such Seller
pursuant to the bylaws or other governing or constituting documents of the
Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries or any similar indemnification or
contribution right with respect to any amounts paid by any Seller.

(e) [Intentionally Omitted].

(f) Sellers' Agent. For purposes of this Article 8, any references to the
Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make any
payments) shall be deemed to refer to Sellers' Agent when Sellers are the
Indemnifying Parties. Sellers' Agent shall have full power and authority on
behalf of each Seller Indemnitor to take any and all actions on behalf of,
execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all
rights of, Seller Indemnitors under this Article 8.

(g) Liability Cap. Other than with respect to (i) an inaccuracy in or breach
of any Seller Fundamental Representation, or (ii) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach (including any breach of a representation
or warranty stemming from fraud) the right of Buyer and Buyer's Other
Indemnified Persons to seek and recover indemnification from Sellers for
Losses under Section 8.1 shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount of
$26,400,000 (the "Cap").

(h) Insurance Recovery. Buyer Entities and their Other Indemnified Persons and
Sellers and their Other Indemnified Persons right to indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement on account of any Losses shall be reduced by all insurance
or other similar proceeds actually recovered by such Party, as applicable, in
cash, from third parties, with respect to such Losses, in each case, net of
the present value of any increase in insurance premiums or other charges paid
by such Party resulting from such Losses and all costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by such Party in recovering such proceeds from such third party. The
Buyer Entities and their Other Indemnified Persons shall use their reasonable
efforts and take all reasonable steps to pursue any available coverage under
any "occurrence" based insurance policies of the Acquired Companies. The
inability of any Buyer Entities and their Other Indemnified Persons and
Sellers and their Other Indemnified Persons to recover any insurance or
similar proceeds or any third-party's denial or successful defense of a claim
shall not in any way prevent or limit such Buyer Entities and their Other
Indemnified Persons and Sellers and their Other Indemnified Persons, as the
case may be, rights to indemnification for such claim under this Agreement.

(i) Split of Insurance Deductible/Retention for Certain Product Liability
Matters. Except for any breach stemming from fraud, in the event Buyer and its
Other Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification resulting from a
breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth Section
3.22(c) with respect to product liability matters and such Losses are fully
covered by applicable insurance, to the extent of any Losses related to any
per claim deductible or retention relating to such applicable insurance,
Sellers shall only be responsible to indemnify Buyer and its Other Indemnified
Persons for one-half of the amount of such applicable per claim deductible or
retention.

(j) Split of Certain Costs and Expenses Related to Disputed Product Warranty
Claims; Disputed Product Warranty Cost and Expense Cap. Except for any breach
stemming



from fraud, in the event Buyer and its Other Indemnified Persons are entitled
to indemnification resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.22(c) on account of
costs and expenses incurred resulting from contested or disputed product
warranty claims (such fees and costs consisting of attorney's and other
litigation (or dispute resolution) fees and expenses and dispute settlement
costs, the "Disputed Product Warranty Costs and Expenses), Buyer on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall each bear one-half of the amounts
related to the Acquired Companies' and Buyers' Disputed Product Warranty Costs
and Expenses; and provided further, that Sellers shall not be liable to pay an
amount, in the aggregate, in excess of $2 million for their portion of such
Disputed Product Warranty Costs and Expenses.

8.4 Certain Survival Periods.

(a) Survival of Representations and Warranties and Pre-Closing Covenants.
Subject to Section 8.4(b), each representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in this Agreement
that do not expressly survive the Closing, will survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect until the date
that is 24 months after the Closing Date, at which time such representation,
warranty, covenant, and agreement will expire and terminate and no
indemnification obligation will be associated therewith or based thereon;
provided, however that the Seller Fundamental Representations shall survive
for six years after the Closing Date and the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.5 shall survive until the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to the underlying subject matter of such
representations and warranties, plus 30 days.

(b) Survival of Post-Closing Covenants and Agreements. Each covenant and
agreement (i.e., other than representations and warranties) in this Agreement
that expressly survives the Closing, and all associated rights to
indemnification, will survive Closing in accordance with its terms.

(c) Claims for Indemnification. No Party will be liable under this Article 8
for any Losses suffered by (i) any Seller or any of its Other Indemnified
Persons or (ii) either Buyer Entity or any of its Other Indemnified Persons,
as applicable, arising out of a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement contained in this Agreement unless a claim therefor is
asserted in writing prior to the expiration of the survival period described
in clauses (a) and (b) above in accordance with Section 8.5. Each claim for
indemnification under this Agreement regarding a representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement that is validly made in accordance with Section 8.5
before expiration of the applicable survival period will not terminate before
final determination and satisfaction of such claim.

8.5 Notice of Claims and Procedures.

(a) Notice of Claims. A Party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the
"Claiming Party") will give the Party obligated to provide such
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt notice of any claim, for
which such Claiming Party proposes to demand indemnification, (i) by a Person
that is not a Party nor an Other Indemnified Person (such a claim being a
"Third Party Claim" and such notice of such Third Party Claim being the
"Initial Claim Notice") or (ii) that does not involve a Third Party Claim, in
each case specifying the amount and nature of, and basis for, such claim (in
each case, to the extent known). Thereafter, the Claiming Party will give the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Claiming Party's (or any of its
applicable Other Indemnified Person's) receipt or delivery thereof, copies of
all documents (including court papers) received or delivered by the Claiming
Party (or any such Other Indemnified



Person) relating to any such Third Party Claim. The failure to promptly give
such notice or to promptly give such copies will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any Liability hereunder, except if the Indemnifying Party was
prejudiced thereby, but only to the extent of such prejudice.

(b) Access and Cooperation. Each Party will, and will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons to, cooperate and assist in all reasonable respects
regarding such Third Party Claim, including by promptly making available to
such other Party (and its legal counsel and other professional advisers with a
reasonable need to know) all books and records of such Person relating to such
Third Party Claim, subject to reasonable confidentiality precautions.

(c) Defense and Participation Regarding Third Party Claims. This Section
8.5(c) relates to Third Party Claims.

(i) Election to Conduct Defense. Promptly after receiving an Initial Claim
Notice under Section 8.5(a), the Indemnifying Party will have the option to
conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. To elect to conduct such defense, the Indemnifying Party
must give written notice of such election to the Claiming Party within 20 days
after the Claiming Party gives the corresponding Initial Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party.

(ii) Conduct of Defense, Participation and Settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim, then (1) the Claiming
Party may participate, at its own expense, in such defense (including any
Proceeding regarding such Third Party Claim) and will have the right to
receive copies of all notices, pleadings or other similar submissions
regarding such defense, (2) each Party will keep the other Party reasonably
informed of all matters material to such defense and Third Party Claim at all
stages thereof, (3) the Claiming Party will not (and will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons not to) admit Liability with respect to, or compromise or
settle, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) and (4) the
Indemnifying Party will not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim,
without the consent of the Claiming Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld), if such compromise or settlement (A) provides for (x)
relief other than monetary damages or (y) monetary damages if the Indemnifying
Party has not acknowledged in writing that it shall be solely responsible for
such monetary damages, (B) involves any material limitation on any future
operations of the Claiming Party (or any of its Other Indemnified Persons) or
(C) does not irrevocably release the Claiming Party (and any applicable Other
Indemnified Person) from all Liability regarding such Third Party Claim, other
than any monetary Liability being satisfied by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Claiming Party reasonably
believes that a conflict of interest exists in respect of a Third Party Claim
or if the defendants in, or targets of, any such action or proceeding include
both the Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Claiming Party
shall have reasonably concluded upon advice of counsel that there may be legal
defenses available to it or to other Indemnified Parties that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, then, in each
case, the Claiming Party shall have the right to retain separate counsel
selected by the Claiming Party to represent the Claiming Party in the defense
of such Third Party Claim and the reasonable fees and expenses of the Claiming
Party in connection therewith shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.



(iii) Indemnifying Party Does Not Conduct Defense. If the Indemnifying Party
does not validly elect to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, then
the Claiming Party may conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim and the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Claiming Party in connection therewith
will be paid by the Indemnifying Party, and the Claiming Party will have the
right to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim after receiving the
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld).

8.6 Indemnification Adjusts Aggregate Purchase Price for Tax Purposes. Each
Party will, including retroactively, treat indemnification payments under this
Agreement as adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price for Tax purposes to
the extent permitted under Applicable Law.

8.7 Escrow. As a source, but not the exclusive source, for payment for the
Buyer Entities, Acquired Companies and their Other Indemnified Persons for
indemnification claims under Section 8.1(a), the Aggregate Escrow Amount will
be deposited into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") pursuant to Section
2.4(a)(ii) and the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto in
Exhibit 8.7 (the "Escrow Agreement").

(a) Escrow Sub-Accounts. The Escrow Agreement will provide for the
establishment, funding and release of the following Escrow Account sub-
accounts:

(i) Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment Account. On the Closing Date, an
amount equal to $10,000,000 will be deposited into a segregated Aggregate
Purchase Price adjustment amount sub-account of the Escrow Account (the
"Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment Account") to provide for any Aggregate
Purchase Price adjustments under Section 2.5; and

(ii) Indemnity Escrow Account. On the Closing Date, an amount equal to the Cap
(the "Indemnity Escrow Amount") will be deposited into a segregated indemnity
escrow sub-account of the Escrow Account ("Indemnity Escrow Account") to
provide for claims for indemnification by the Buyer Entities and their Other
Indemnified Persons (or any of them) pursuant to Article 8.

(b) The Aggregate Purchase Price Adjustment Account will be released as
provided in Section 2.5(c).

(c) Upon the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date (such date, the
"Indemnity Escrow Release Date"), Buyer and Sellers Agent will provide joint
instructions to the Escrow Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to (i) disburse
the amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, less any Unsatisfied
Escrow Claims, to Sellers based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages and
(ii) retain in the Indemnity Escrow Account funds necessary to satisfy the
Unsatisfied Escrow Claims until such time as the Escrow Agent is permitted to
disburse such funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Unsatisfied Escrow Claims" means the aggregate of any and all
claims for indemnification by the Buyer Entities or their Other Indemnified
Persons (or any of them) pursuant to Article 8 which either (1) were asserted
in writing prior to, and are pending on, the Indemnity Escrow Release Date
(the amounts of such claims will be deemed to be (A) the amounts specified in
the applicable notices or (B) if not specified in the applicable notices, the
amounts later specified in good faith by the applicable Buyer Entity with
respect to such claims in writing to the Escrow Agent and the Sellers Agent
prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release Date) or (2) have been finally
determined in favor of a Buyer Entity or its Other Indemnified Persons (or



any of them), but have not been fully paid to such Buyer Entity or its Other
Indemnified Persons as of the Indemnity Escrow Release Date.

(d) Any funds retained in the Indemnity Escrow Account on the Indemnity Escrow
Release Date to potentially satisfy any Unsatisfied Escrow Claims will, (i) if
resolved in favor of a Buyer Entity (or any of its Other Indemnified Persons),
be paid by the Escrow Agent to such Buyer Entity or the applicable third party
(to the extent requested by such Buyer Entity) within three Business Days
after the Escrow Agent's receipt of a joint written notice executed by Buyer
and Sellers Agent directing such payment (or the applicable judicial or
arbitral decision, if applicable) or (ii) (1) if resolved in favor of a Buyer
Entity (or any of its Other Indemnified Persons) but in an amount less than
the amount retained by the Escrow Agent for such Unsatisfied Escrow Claim (as
determined in Section 8.7(c)), or (2) if resolved in favor of Sellers, then
the amount reserved in the Indemnity Escrow Account for such Unsatisfied
Escrow Claim (less any amount paid to a Buyer Entity (or any of its Other
Indemnified Persons) under clause (i) hereof), be paid by the Escrow Agent
within three Business Days after the Escrow Agent's receipt of a joint written
notice executed by Buyer and Sellers Agent (or the applicable judicial or
arbitral decision, if applicable) to Sellers based on their respective Pro
Rata Percentages. Within three Business Days following resolution of the last
Unsatisfied Escrow Claim, the Escrow Agent will distribute the amounts then-
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account to Sellers based on their respective
Pro Rata Percentages. Each of Buyer and Sellers Agent agrees to provide joint
instructions to the Escrow Agent to carry out the provisions of this Section
8.7(d).

9.7 Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedule, other Schedules and Exhibits, constitutes the entire
Agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter herein and
supersedes any other existing representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
or similar assurance (whether direct or indirect, written or oral, or
statutory, express or implied) of any Party regarding such subject matter (and
there is no other representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or similar
assurance of any Party regarding such subject matter). No supplement,
modification or amendment hereof will be binding unless expressed as such and
executed in writing by each Party. Except to the extent as may otherwise be
stated herein, no waiver of any term hereof will be binding unless expressed
as such in a document executed by the Party making such waiver (and then only
to the extent so expressed).



No waiver of any term hereof will be a waiver of any other term hereof,
whether or not similar, nor will any such waiver be a continuing waiver beyond
its stated terms. Except to the extent as may otherwise be stated herein,
failure to enforce strict compliance with any term hereof will not be a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any existing or subsequent failure to comply.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sections 9.4, 9.6(b), this
Section 9.7, or 9.12 (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent
an amendment, supplement, waiver, or other modification of such provision
would modify the substance of such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented,
waived, or otherwise modified without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources.

9.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any right or
obligation hereunder will be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred (by
operation of law or otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent
of the other Party, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and
provided further that Buyer may make a collateral assignment of its rights
(but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any Financing Source. This
Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the respective
permitted successors and assigns of the Parties. Any purported assignment,
delegation or other transfer not permitted by this Section is void.

9.9 Severability; Blue‑Pencil‑. If any term of this Agreement is determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, then all other terms of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in
full force and effect, and such term automatically will be amended so that it
is valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable
Law, but as close to the Parties' original intent as is permissible.

9.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which will be considered one and the same agreement, and will become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered, in person or by facsimile or electronic image scan,
receipt acknowledged, to the other Party.



9.11 Disclosure Schedule. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed
to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made in this
Agreement unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the item as an exception
to such representation or warranty; however, any information disclosed in any
section number shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated into any other
section number under this Agreement to the extent (but only the extent) that
it is reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure alone that such
information is responsive to the representations to which such other section
relates. A disclosure made by Sellers in any section of this Agreement or any
Disclosure Schedule will expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by
Sellers, or otherwise imply, that any such matter is material or creates a
measure for materiality for the purposes of this Agreement. Sellers' Agent may
at any time prior to the Closing update or supplement any Section of the
Disclosure Schedules or provide a new Section qualifying any representation or
warranty of Sellers contained herein that is not subject to the Disclosure
Schedule as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any fact or
condition that arises only after the date hereof and which would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedule (each, a
"Schedule Supplement"). If such Schedule Supplement is not material, such
Schedule Supplement shall be treated for all purposes as if it had been
included in this Agreement as of the date hereof and, accordingly, Buyer (for
itself and all Buyer Indemnitees) shall be deemed to have waived any and all
rights it and all other Buyer Indemnitees may have arising from or relating to
the breach or inaccuracy of the representations or warranty described in such
non-material Schedule Supplement (including the right to indemnification
pursuant to Article 8). For the avoidance of doubt, and irrespective of
whether or not the Closing occurs, no material Schedule Supplement will be
deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement for any purpose nor shall any material
Schedule Supplement limit the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, including
Article 7 and Article 8.

9.12 Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no Party hereto (other than the Buyer Parties) and their respective
Affiliates and their and their respective Affiliates' officers, directors,
employees, partners, trustees, shareholders, controlling persons, agents and
representatives shall have any rights or claims (whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Sources based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the Debt Commitment Letters, the Debt Financing
or the transactions contemplated thereby.
