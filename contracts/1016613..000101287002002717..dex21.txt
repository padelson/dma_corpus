-iii-     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER is made and entered into as of June 12, 2002, by and among Liquid
Audio, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Liquid"), April Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Liquid (the "Merger
Sub"), and Alliance Entertainment Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("Alliance").   RECITALS   A. The Boards of Directors of each
of Liquid, Merger Sub and Alliance have approved, and deem it advisable and
in the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders to
consummate, the business combination transaction provided for herein in which
Merger Sub would merge with and into Alliance.   B. The Boards of Directors
of Liquid, Merger Sub and Alliance have each determined that the Merger (as
defined in Section 1.1) and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
consistent with, and in furtherance of, their respective business strategies
and goals.   C. Liquid and Alliance desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.   D. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the parties\'
willingness to enter into this Agreement, AEC Associates, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Principal Stockholder"), is entering into a
Voting Agreement (the "Voting Agreement").   E. For Federal income tax
purposes, the parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), and the parties intend, by executing this Agreement,
to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 354(a) of the
Code.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger.
At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
Delaware General Corporate Law ("DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Alliance (the "Merger"), and the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease. Alliance shall continue its corporate existence under the
laws of the State of Delaware under the name "Alliance Entertainment Corp."
and shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liquid after the Merger. The Merger
shall have the effect set forth in the DGCL. Alliance, as the
surviving    corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."   1.2 Effective Time; Closing.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") (the time of such filing
(or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Alliance and Liquid and
specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") on or as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date (as herein defined). The closing
of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, at a time and date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in
writing (the "Closing Date").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Alliance and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
Alliance and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors
and Officers.   (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation
of Alliance, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended. The Bylaws of Alliance, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.   (b) At the Effective
Time, the directors and officers of Alliance immediately prior to the
Effective Time will become the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation and will hold office from the Effective Time until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.   (c) Prior to the
Effective Time, Liquid will file Liquid\'s Second Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation ("Liquid\'s Restated Certificate") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Liquid\'s Restated Certificate
will (i) reflect that the total number of shares Liquid is authorized to
issue is 205,000,000, (ii) reflect that Liquid expressly elects not to be
governed by Section 203 of the DGCL and (iii) reflect that
Liquid\'s corporate name shall be as agreed upon by the parties (the
amendment in clause (i) of this section is referred to as the (c)
"Capitalization Amendment", and the amendments in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
of this section are collectively referred to as the "Charter
Amendments").   1.5 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Alliance or any shares of capital stock
of Alliance, the following shall occur:   -2-     (a) Alliance
Preferred Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding share of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Alliance
(the "Alliance Preferred Stock") shall be converted into shares of common
stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Alliance (the "Alliance Common
Stock").   (b) Alliance Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
share of Alliance Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including the shares of Alliance Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Alliance Preferred Stock), but
excluding Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.6) and any shares of
Alliance Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.5(d), will be
automatically converted into the right to receive 0.404975 (the "Exchange
Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Liquid
("Liquid Common Stock"), subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section
1.5(f), and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(e).  
(c) Merger Sub Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each share of common
stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.   (d) Cancellation of Treasury and Liquid
Owned Stock. Each share of Alliance Common Stock held by Alliance or Liquid
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliance or Liquid
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.   (e) No Fractional Shares. No fractional
shares of Liquid Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger,
and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued.
Any holder of Alliance Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Liquid Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Liquid Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in
lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such holders\'
Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.8(c)), be paid in cash the dollar
amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the closing price of Liquid Common Stock on The
Nasdaq National Market on the last trading day immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   (f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio
shall be automatically adjusted to take into account:   (i) any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Liquid Common Stock, Alliance
Common Stock or Alliance Preferred Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like change with respect to Liquid Common Stock,
Alliance Common Stock or Alliance Preferred Stock having a record date on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time; or   (ii) any
changes in the number of outstanding shares set forth in the representations
and warranties in Section 2.2(a) or Section 3.2(a) (including but not limited
to   -3-    outstanding shares which should have been disclosed pursuant
to such representations and warranties but were omitted from such
disclosure); in order to insure that after any such automatic adjustment of
the Exchange Ratio, (i) the holders of shares of outstanding Alliance Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (including the shares of
Alliance Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of
Alliance Preferred Stock) will own 67% of the outstanding shares of Liquid
Common Stock immediately after the Effective Time and (ii) the holders of
shares of outstanding Liquid Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time will own 33% of the outstanding shares of Liquid Common Stock
immediately after the Effective Time. The percentages in this Section 1.5(f)
are subject to change only to the extent applicable due to rounding to
accommodate the elimination of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.5(e).   1.6 Dissenting Shares. Shares of capital stock of
Alliance that have not been voted for adoption of the Merger and with respect
to which appraisal rights have been properly perfected in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the applicable shares of Liquid Common Stock pursuant to
the Exchange Ratio at or after the Effective Time, unless and until the
holder of such shares withdraws such holder\'s demand for appraisal rights or
becomes ineligible for appraisal rights. If a holder of Dissenting Shares
withdraws such holder\'s demand for appraisal rights or becomes ineligible
for appraisal rights, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such event, whichever later occurs, such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive Liquid Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Ratio.   1.7
Treatment of Derivative Securities; Assumption of Stock Options. As of the
Effective Time, by operation of law and by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Alliance Options (as
defined in Section 2.2(b)):   (a) Liquid shall assume, subject to paragraph
(b) below, Alliance\'s obligations under each of (i) the Amended and Restated
1998 General Stock Incentive Plan of Digital On-Demand, Inc., (ii) the 1998
Executive Stock Plan of Digital On-Demand, Inc. (iii) the Alliance
Entertainment Corp. 1999 Equity Participation and Incentive Plan and (iv) the
Alliance Entertainment Corp. 1999 Equity Participation Plan (collectively the
"Alliance Option Plans"); and   (b) each Alliance Option which, prior to the
Effective Time, represented the right to acquire shares of Alliance Common
Stock, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time and regardless of the
respective exercise prices thereof, will be assumed by Liquid. Each Alliance
Option so assumed by Liquid under this Agreement will continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Alliance Option
Plans (and any applicable stock option agreement for such Alliance Options)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions), except that (i) each Alliance Option will be exercisable
(or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of
whole shares of Liquid Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares of Alliance Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Alliance Option   -4-    immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of
shares of Liquid Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Liquid Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such assumed
Alliance Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Alliance Common Stock at which such Alliance
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent. Each assumed Alliance
Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the
same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it
was vested as to immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as
reasonably practicable, Liquid will issue to each person who holds an assumed
Alliance Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such
Alliance Option by Liquid. Without limitation, Liquid shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Liquid Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Alliance Options
assumed in accordance with Sections 1.7(a) and 1.7(b).   (c) Further Option
Provisions. Liquid will take all such actions as may be necessary or
advisable in order to implement the intent and effect of the arrangements set
forth in Sections 1.7(a) and 1.7(b). In addition, within no more than 120
days of the Effective Time, Liquid will register on Form S-8 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), that number
of shares of Liquid Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Liquid
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the assumed Alliance Options.  
(d) Warrants. As of the Effective Time, by operation of law and by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, all
Alliance Warrants (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) that are then
outstanding, if any, shall be assumed by Liquid in accordance with the terms
of the instrument by which such Alliance Warrant is evidenced. All rights
with respect to Alliance Common Stock (including rights to Alliance Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Alliance
Preferred Stock) subject to outstanding Alliance Warrants shall thereupon be
converted into rights with respect to Liquid Common Stock. Accordingly, from
and after the Effective Time, each Alliance Warrant assumed by Liquid may be
exercised solely for shares of Liquid Common Stock. Without limitation,
Liquid shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Liquid Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of all Alliance Warrants in accordance with this Section 1.7(d).   1.8
Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Liquid shall select an
institution reasonably satisfactory to Alliance to act as the exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.   (b) Liquid to Provide Common Stock.
At, or as soon as practicable after, the Effective Time, Liquid shall deposit
in trust with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article
I, the shares of Liquid Common Stock issuable and cash payable pursuant to
Section 1.5 in exchange for outstanding shares of Alliance Common Stock. In
addition, Liquid shall make available as necessary from time to time after
the Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient for any dividends
or distributions which holders of shares of Alliance Common Stock may be
entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(d). Any cash and Liquid  
-5-    Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."   (c) Exchange Procedures. At, or as
soon as practicable after, the Effective Time, Liquid shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of
a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Alliance Common Stock
(including shares of Alliance Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of
Alliance Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time) whose
shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Liquid Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to Section 1.8(d), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Liquid may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Liquid
Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.8(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Liquid, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of shares of
Liquid Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares (after taking into
account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(b) (which shall be in uncertificated book
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or is otherwise
required by applicable law or regulation) and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence the ownership of the number of shares of Liquid Common Stock and
cash in lieu of fractional shares into which such shares of Alliance Common
Stock (including shares of Alliance Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
Alliance Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall have
been so converted and the right to receive any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(d).   (d) Distributions With Respect to
Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the date hereof with respect to Liquid Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered
Certificates with respect to the shares of Alliance Common Stock represented
by such unsurrendered Certificates until the holders of record of such
Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after
such surrender, the number of shares of Liquid Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect
to such shares of Liquid Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of Liquid Common Stock.   -6-    
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If shares of Liquid Common Stock are to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the Persons (as defined in Section
8.3(c)) requesting such exchange will have paid to Liquid or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.6)
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Liquid Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Liquid or any agent
designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f)
Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Alliance Common Stock or Alliance Preferred Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under
any other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(c)). To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such
consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise
have been paid.   (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 1.8, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Liquid Common
Stock or Alliance Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Liquid on a daily
basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to Alliance stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
Alliance stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to
Liquid.   (i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall, at Liquid\'s request, be delivered to
Liquid and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such
Certificates in compliance with this Section 1.8 shall after such delivery to
Liquid look only to Liquid for the shares of Liquid Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.5 and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.8(d) with respect to the shares of Alliance Common Stock formerly
represented thereby. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Alliance Common Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 2.3(c)) shall, to the extent
permitted by law, become the property of Liquid free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   1.9 No Further
Ownership Rights in Alliance Stock. All shares of Liquid Common Stock issued
upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Alliance Common Stock in  
-7-    accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.8(d)) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Alliance Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Alliance
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article I.   1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the
event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such shares of Liquid Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.8(d); provided, however, that
Liquid may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
indemnify Liquid and/or post a bond in favor of Liquid against any claim that
may be made against Liquid, Alliance or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   1.11 Tax
Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a).   ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ALLIANCE  
Alliance represents and warrants to Liquid, subject to the
exceptions disclosed in writing in the disclosure schedules supplied by
Alliance to Liquid dated as of the date hereof and certified by a duly
authorized officer of Alliance (the "Alliance Schedules"), as follows:  
2.1 Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents; Subsidiaries.   (a)
Organization; Standing and Power. Alliance is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Each Subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.1(c)) is either a
corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, as applicable. Alliance and each of its
Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing would not

termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the

authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which if not obtained or
made would not have a Material Adverse Effect to Alliance or Liquid or
materially delay the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
Merger within the time frame in which the Merger would otherwise be
consummated in the absence of the need for such consent, approval, order,
authorization, registration, declaration or filings. The consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings set forth in

of "Acquisition" shall be deemed to be references to "50%" and a liquidation

respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Liquid

which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
stockholder approval. This Agreement may be not amended except by execution
of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Liquid and
Alliance.   -59-     7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the

warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered

conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid

waiver of such right.   ARTICLE VIII  GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1 Non-

warranties of Alliance and Liquid contained in this Agreement, or
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall terminate at
the Effective Time, and only the covenants that by their terms survive the

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference shall
be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a
section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of
this Agreement, the words "include," "includes" and "including," when used
herein, shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the
business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the
business of all such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. An
exception or disclosure made in Alliance Schedules with regard to a
representation of Alliance, or in the Liquid Schedules with regard to a
representation of Liquid, shall be deemed made with respect to any other
representation by such party to which such exception or disclosure is readily
apparent.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material
Adverse Effect," when used in connection with an entity, means any change,
event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect (any such item, an
"Effect"), individually or when taken together with all other Effects that
have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the
Material Adverse Effect, that is or is reasonably likely to (i) be materially
adverse to the business, assets (including   -61-    intangible
assets), capitalization, financial condition or results of operations of such
entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries or (ii) materially impede the
ability or authority of such entity to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof and applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that, for
purposes of clause (i) above, in no event shall any of the following, alone
or in combination, be deemed to constitute, nor shall any of the following be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a
Material Adverse Effect on any entity: (A) any Effect resulting from
compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (B) in the case
of Liquid, any change in such entity\'s stock price or trading volume, in and
of itself, (C) any Effect that results from changes affecting any of the
industries in which such entity operates generally or the United States
economy generally (which changes in each case do not disproportionately
affect such entity in any material respect), (D) any Effect that results from
changes affecting general worldwide economic or capital market conditions
(which changes in each case do not disproportionately affect such entity in
any material respect) or (E) in the case of Liquid, (i) the failure to meet
published or internal earnings, revenue estimates or projections or (ii) the
continuing loss of money resulting from the business operations of Liquid.  
(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean
any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation),
general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability
company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise, association,
organization, entity or Governmental Entity.   8.4 Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.   8.5 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the
Alliance Schedules and the Liquid Schedules, (i) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being
understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies hereunder except for those individuals referenced in
Section 5.9.   8.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.   -62-     8.7 Other Remedies; Specific
Performance. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.   8.8
Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.   8.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.   8.10 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation
of this Section 8.10 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   8.11 Waiver
of Jury Trial. EACH OF LIQUID AND ALLIANCE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF LIQUID OR ALLIANCE IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.   8.12
Computation of Time. Whenever the last day for the exercise of any privilege
or the discharge of any duty hereunder shall fall upon a Saturday, Sunday, or
any date banks in the State of California are closed, the party having such
privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the
next succeeding day which is a regular business day.   *****
