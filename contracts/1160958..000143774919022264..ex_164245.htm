RECITALS

  



  

A. Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub believe it is in the best interests of
their respective companies and the stockholders of their respective companies
to effect the merger hereafter provided for herein, in which Merger Sub would

directors of Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub have approved the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

  



  

B. Prior to delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement
for Acquiror's willingness to have entered into this Agreement, each Key

proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement, in each case, to
become effective upon the Closing and in form and substance as agreed between
Acquiror and Target (collectively, the " **Key Employee Agreements** ");

  



  

C. No later than twelve (12) hours following the execution of this
Agreement and as a material inducement to the willingness of Acquiror to enter
into this Agreement, stockholders of Target constituting the Signing

and warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree
as follows:

  



  

1. _Definitions_.

  



  

1.1 _Merger Consideration Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the
following terms related to the Merger Consideration shall have the following
meanings:

  



  

" **Merger Consideration** " means the Closing Merger Consideration, _plus_
the portion of the Escrow Consideration, if any, that is paid to the Effective

long-term liabilities for contingent severance obligations for any Business
Service Provider (as defined in the Spinoza Purchase Agreement) who is
employed by the Vietnam Subsidiary (as defined in the Spinoza Purchase

(b) _Review/Disputes_.

  



  

(i) If Securityholders' Agent disputes the calculation of any of the items
referenced in _Section_ _2.11_ _(a)_ , then Securityholders' Agent shall
deliver a written notice (a " **Dispute Notice** ") to Acquiror at any time
during the thirty (30)-day period commencing upon delivery to the
Securityholders' Agent of the Closing Date Schedule (the " **Review Period**
"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth the basis for the dispute of any such
calculation in reasonable detail.

  



  

(ii) If Securityholders' Agent does not deliver a Dispute Notice to
Acquiror prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Date
Schedule shall be deemed final and binding.

  



  

(iii) If Securityholders' Agent delivers a Dispute Notice to Acquiror
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then Acquiror and
Securityholders' Agent shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on any
items disputed in the Dispute Notice within the ten (10) day period commencing
upon delivery to Acquiror of the Dispute Notice. If Securityholders' Agent and
Acquiror are unable to reach agreement on any items in the Dispute Notice
within such ten (10) day period, then either Acquiror or Securityholders'
Agent may submit the unresolved objections to the office of Deloitte LLP, a
national accounting firm (such firm, and any successor thereto, being referred
to herein as the " **Accounting Firm** "), and such firm shall be directed by
Securityholders' Agent and Acquiror to resolve the unresolved objections in
accordance with the immediately following sentence. In connection with the
resolution of any such dispute by the Accounting Firm (i) each of Acquiror and
Securityholders' Agent shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the
Accounting Firm to provide their views as to any disputed issues, (ii) the
Accounting Firm shall determine only such items as remain disputed from the
Dispute Notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event, within twenty (20) days of such
referral) and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a reasonably
detailed copy of its calculations to Securityholders' Agent and Acquiror and
(iii) the determination made by the Accounting Firm of disputes arising from
the items referenced in _Section_ _2.11_ _(a)_ shall be final and binding,
absent manifest error; provided, however, that the Accounting Firm's
resolution of each disputed item from the Dispute Notice must be within the
range of differences between Acquiror's and Securityholders' Agent's positions
with respect to each such disputed item. The expenses and fees of the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated equally between the Surviving Corporation
and the Securityholders' Agent on behalf of the Effective Time Holders.

  



  

(c) _Payment Upon Final Determination of Adjustments_.

  



  

(i) If (A) the Closing Merger Consideration (calculated based on the items
set forth on the Closing Date Schedule, as finally determined in accordance
with _Section_ _2.11_ _(b)_ ), is less than (B) the Closing Merger
Consideration (as determined based upon the Payment Schedule) (the positive
amount of such difference, the " **Closing Overpayment** "), then the (x)
Acquiror and Securityholders' Agent shall, within three (3) Business Days
following the final determination of matters in accordance with _Section_
_2.11_ _(b)_ , jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written
notice instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Closing Overpayment to Acquiror
from the Escrow Fund; provided, however, that if the Securityholders' Agent
fails to execute and deliver such written notice within such three (3)
Business Day period, Acquiror's unilateral execution and delivery of such
written notice shall constitute binding instructions to the Escrow Agent by
Acquiror and the Securityholders' Agent to release the Closing Overpayment to
Acquiror from the Escrow Consideration (to the extent of the Escrow Fund); and
(y) if the amount held in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the full
Closing Overpayment, then, each Effective Time Holder shall pay, within ten
(10) Business Days following the final determination of matters in accordance
with _Section_ _2.11_ _(b)_ , such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Portion of
the amount of the Closing Overpayment to Acquiror.

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) If (A) the Closing Merger Consideration (calculated based on the
items set forth on the Closing Date Schedule, as finally determined in
accordance with _Section_ _2.11_ _(b)_ ), is greater than (B) the Closing
Merger Consideration (as determined based upon the Payment Schedule) (the
positive amount of such difference, the " **Closing Underpayment** "), then
Acquiror shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
following the determination of the Closing Underpayment, pay the Payment
Agent, for benefit of and prompt payment to the Effective Time Holders, an
amount in cash equal to their Pro Rata Portion of the Closing Underpayment,
and the Payment Agent shall promptly distribute to each Effective Time Holder
such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Portion of the amount of the Closing
Underpayment.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this _Section_ _2.11_ shall limit any rights of any
Acquiror Indemnified Persons to make an indemnification claim as set forth in
_Section_ _9_.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in no

pursuant to such instructions; and (iii) instructions for use in effecting the

of a Certificate for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Acquiror, together with such letter of
transmittal and other documents, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration that such holder is eligible to
receive as set forth on the Payment Schedule. The Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Target
Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes to evidence the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any Effective Time Holder who, prior to the Closing Date, has delivered to
Payment Agent a Certificate (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as
described in _Section_ _2.14_ ), together with a letter of transmittal and
other documents, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, shall be entitled to receive a wire transfer on the

liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this _Section _ _2.12_ shall
also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that
the obligations of Acquiror under this _Section _ _2.12_ shall commence on
the date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section _ _2.6_ hereof.

  



  

2.13 _No Further Ownership Rights in Target Capital Stock_. The Merger
Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Target
Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Target
Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Target Capital Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section
_ _2_.

  



  

2.14 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates representing Target Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the

indemnity or enter into an indemnification agreement to indemnify Acquiror,
the Payment Agent or the Surviving Corporation as requested by Acquiror
against any claim that may be made against Acquiror, the Payment Agent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

Merger Sub and Target will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may
be necessary or desirable in order to effectuate the Merger in accordance with
this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Target and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Target and
Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations
or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

  



  

2.16 _Rounding_. The amount of cash each Effective Time Holder is

withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Section 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with

otherwise have been paid.

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (or its equivalent)
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, except where

for the four-month period ended July 31, 2019, (collectively, the " **Target

transactions are executed with management's general or specific
authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformance with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets; (iii) access to Target's and its Subsidiaries'

Financial Statements, and (iii) no fraud, whether or not material, involving
any member of the board of directors of Target or management or any other

and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Target Employee Plan. There are no actions, suits

becomes aware that results in the inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
of such party in this Agreement; and (h) the occurrence of any event that, had

Target; provided, that the delivery of any notice by any party pursuant to
this provision shall not modify any representation or warranty of such party,
cure any breaches thereof or limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies

or warranties of the party disclosing such information. Target's breach of
this _Section_ _6.7_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this
_Section_ _6.7_ for any purpose under this Agreement but shall instead
constitute only a breach of the underlying representation, warranty or
covenant, as the case may be.

**Severance Cap** "); _provided_ that Acquiror shall bear the cost of any
Termination Severance in excess of the Severance Cap (such Acquiror's share of
Termination Severance is referred to as the " **Acquiror Termination
Severance** "). For the avoidance of doubt, any transition stay bonus provided
by Acquiror to any Terminating Employee following the Closing, including the
employer share of employment taxes related thereto, shall not be considered
Termination Severance and shall be the sole responsibility of Acquiror.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) All earned but unpaid wages, vacation, sick leave and PTO or other
benefits, in each case, earned or accrued through 11:59 p.m. on the Closing

shall be treated as a Target Transaction Expense hereunder to the extent not
included in Current Liabilities. Except as set forth in subsection (c) above,
any Termination Severance payable to Terminating Employees, shall be paid by
Target and shall be treated as Target Transaction Expenses hereunder to the
extent not included in Current Liabilities.

  



  

(e) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and
contingent upon the Closing and without liability to Acquiror, Target and any
ERISA Affiliate shall terminate all Target Incentive Plans and, if requested
by Acquiror, all Target Employee Plans, other than any Target Employee Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each a " **401(k)
Plan** "). Target shall provide Acquiror with evidence that such Target
Incentive Plans and Target Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the Target's board of directors or any applicable committee
thereof. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
reasonable review and approval by Acquiror.

  



  

(f) Acquiror agrees that subject to Applicable Law: (i) Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate either in Target Employee Plans at
preexisting levels or in the retirement, health, vacation and other employee
benefit plans of Acquiror, including equity incentive opportunities, other
than the Transition Bonus Plan (the " **Acquiror Benefit Plans** ") that are
generally made available by Acquiror to similarly situated employees and
subject to the terms and conditions of such plans; (ii) certain transitioning
out and continuing employees and contractors or consultants, as determined by
Acquiror and Target's Chief Executive Officer in their discretion, shall be
eligible to participate in a bonus plan that provides for a retention pool of
$5,000,000 in cash, pursuant to the standard form of enrollment letter
thereunder (the " **Transition Bonus Plan** ") to be established by Acquiror
effective as of, and conditional upon, the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Transition Bonus Plan, and subject to such employees and
contractors or consultants' due execution and delivery to Acquiror of an
enrollment letter to the Transition Bonus Plan (including, to the extent
allowed by Applicable Law, a valid and enforceable general release and waiver
of claims in favor of Target, Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates); provided, however, that nothing in this _Section _ _6.10_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Acquiror after the
Closing to amend or terminate any such Acquiror Benefit Plans at any time in
accordance with their terms; and (iii) all offers of employment made to
Continuing Employees and Key Employees, shall include a base rate of cash
compensation and target incentive cash compensation, and incentive equity
opportunities and benefits, which, taken together, are equal to or greater
than those currently provided to such employees of Target and its Subsidiaries
on the date hereof.

  



  

(g) With respect to the Acquiror Benefit Plans and to the extent permitted
under such Acquiror Benefit Plans and under Applicable Law, (i) credit for
service accrued by Continuing Employees (and eligible dependents) for
employment with Target prior to the Effective Time shall be recognized for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not with respect to the accrual of
any benefits or to the extent necessary to prevent duplication of benefits)
and (ii) Acquiror shall use reasonable efforts to cause (1) all waiting
periods, preexisting-condition exclusions, evidence-of-insurability
requirements, and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such Acquiror
Benefit Plans to be waived for each Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents and (2) all eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee
and/or his or her covered dependents under a corresponding Target Employee
Plan on the date such Continuing Employee's participation in the Acquiror
Benefit Plan begins to be given full credit under such Acquiror Benefit Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year (as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Acquiror Benefit Plan to the extent credited
under the corresponding Target Employee Plan).

  



  

   

  



  

(h) Nothing in this _Section _ _6.10_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, modifying or
terminating any benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement, or be
construed to create a right in any employee of Target or Acquiror to
employment with Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, Target or any other
Subsidiary of Acquiror or Target and, subject to any other binding written
agreement between an employee and Acquiror, the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment to the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Continuing Employee or other employee of Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, will be deemed to be a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section_ _6.10_ or any other provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(i) _Section 280G Matters_.

  



  

(i) Target will obtain and deliver to Acquiror, prior to the initiation of
the procedure described in ☒subsection (ii) of this _Section _ _6.10(i)_ , an
excess parachute payment waiver, in the form previously approved by Acquiror,
from each Person who Target and Acquiror reasonably agree is, with respect to
Target or any of its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates, a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and who would
otherwise receive or have the right or entitlement to receive or retain a
"parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) from Target
or any of its Subsidiaries or its ERISA Affiliates, or from Acquiror or any
trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that is a member of a
controlled group or which is under common control with Acquiror within the
meaning of Section 414 of the Code, under Section 280G of the Code in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including in
connection with certain changes in any such Person's employment circumstances
following the consummation of the Merger). By the execution of such waiver
agreement, the Person executing the waiver will agree to waive all of his or
her right and entitlement to receive (or if already paid, his or her right and
entitlement to keep) any portion of such "parachute payments" which would
cause the Person executing the waiver to receive an "excess parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), unless Target's stockholders
approve such waived payments in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of
the Code.

  



  

(ii) At least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, Target will submit
the payments which are waived pursuant to the waiver agreements described in
subsection (i) of this _Section _ _6.10(i)_ to its stockholders and the
holders of the voting power of any entity stockholder for their approval in
accordance with all applicable requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section
1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations.

  



  

   

  



  

6.11 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
Transaction Expenses and any other costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such expense. For purposes of clarity, and notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) any Target Transaction Expenses which remain unpaid at
Closing shall be deducted from the Closing Merger Consideration paid
hereunder, as provided in the applicable provisions of this Agreement, and
(ii) neither the Surviving Corporation nor Acquiror shall be responsible for
payment or reimbursement of the Target Transaction Expenses.

  



  

6.12 _Payment of Indebtedness for Borrowed Money; Release and Termination
of Security Interests_. On or prior to the Closing, (a) Target shall repay all
obligations or other Indebtedness for borrowed money, and (b) Target shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to seek and obtain the release of any and
all outstanding security interests in any of the assets of Target or any of
its Subsidiaries and to terminate all UCC financing statements which have been
filed with respect to such security interests.

  



  

6.13 _Required Contract Consents_. Target shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Required Contract Consents and to deliver
such consents to Acquiror.

  



  

6.14 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Allocation of Taxes_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (the " **Straddle Period** "), the portion of such
Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall to the fullest extent
admissible under Applicable Law of the corresponding federal, state,
provincial and/or local jurisdiction (i) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period, _multiplied_ by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period,
and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains or
receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant
Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date. Any deductions attributable to
cancellation of stock options or payment of any Target Transaction Expenses
shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Tax law.

  



  

(b) _Preparation of Returns_. Target shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Returns for Target for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and Straddle Period that are required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date. Target shall provide Acquiror a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on all such Returns described in the preceding
sentence prior to filing and shall consider such comments in good faith.
Acquiror shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Returns for Target for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Straddle Period that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date. All such Returns filed by
Acquiror after the Closing Date will be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practice and custom of Target to the extent consistent with
Applicable Law. Acquiror shall permit the Securityholders' Agent to review and
comment on each income Return relating to or including a Pre-Closing Tax
Period prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Returns as
reasonably requested. Acquiror may recover from the Escrow Fund, without
duplication of any amount recovered pursuant to _Section_ _9_ **** an amount
equal to such Taxes of Target or any of its Subsidiaries for such periods to
the extent such Taxes were not taken into account in determining Closing
Merger Consideration calculated based on the items set forth on the Closing
Date Schedule, as finally determined in accordance with _Section_ _2.11_
_(b)_.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) _Tax Contests_. After the Closing Date, Acquiror, Target and the
Securityholders' Agent, respectively, shall inform the other party in writing
of the commencement of any audit, examination, proceeding or self-assessment
relating in whole or in part to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (" **Tax
Contest** ") for which Acquiror may be entitled to indemnity from the
Stockholders under this Agreement. After the Closing Date, Acquiror shall have
the exclusive right to represent the interests of Target in any and all Tax
Contests; provided, however, that the Securityholders' Agent shall have the
right to participate in any such Tax Contest and to employ counsel (at the
expense of the Stockholders) of its choice (which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror) for purposes of such participation to the extent that
any such Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to result in a Tax
indemnification liability of the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement. In
the event that Acquiror proposes to compromise or settle any Tax Contest, or
consent or agree to any Tax liability, relating to Target that would result in
an indemnity payment by the Stockholders, the Securityholders' Agent shall
have the right to review such proposed compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement. Acquiror shall not agree or consent to compromise or settle any Tax
Contest on a basis that would result in a liability of the Stockholders for
indemnification unless the Securityholders' Agent consents to such settlement,
compromise or concession, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The provisions of this _Section_ _6.14(d)_ shall
govern rather than the provisions of _Section _ _9_ in the event of any
conflict.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation_. Acquiror, Target and the Securityholders' Agent shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Return required of
Target, and the defense of any Tax Contest, claim, audit, litigation or other
proceeding, with respect to Taxes which may be payable by Target for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Acquiror, Target and the Securityholders' Agent agree to
abide by all record retention requirements of, or record retention agreements
entered into with, any federal, state, provincial and/or local Tax authority.

  



  

(e) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes, and all conveyance
fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne and paid by the Stockholders
when due. The party responsible under Applicable Law for submitting payment of
such Taxes to the applicable Tax authority shall file all necessary Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees. If required by Applicable
Law, Acquiror or Target shall join in the execution of any such Returns and
other documentation.

  



  

   

  



  

(f) _Tax Refunds_. Tax refunds that are received by Acquiror, Target or
any of their Affiliates that relate to Taxes paid by the Target or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the
Stockholders. Acquiror shall or cause to be paid to the Stockholders their
proportionate share of any such Tax refund, less any Taxes incurred in
connection with such Tax refund and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
solely for in connection with obtaining such refund, within 30 calendar days
after receipt thereof.

claim based on a claim for indemnification made by an Acquiror Indemnified
Person pursuant to _Section_ _9_.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Target shall obtain and fully pay the premium

officers' liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Target's existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a director or officer of Target by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (the
" **Tail Policy** "); _provided_ that Target shall give Acquiror a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the selection of the Tail Policy and Target
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Acquiror with respect thereto. If unpaid at Closing, the cost of the Tail
Policy shall be treated as a Target Transaction Expense hereunder. If the
Merger is consummated, neither Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation will
cancel the Tail Policy during its term.

  



  

(c) This _Section_ _6.15_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Target Indemnified Parties; _provided_ that recourse
shall first be against the Tail Policy until it is exhausted before recovery
against Acquiror shall take place.

_8.1(e)_ , by written notice by the terminating party to the other party):

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Acquiror and Target;

  



  

(b) by either Acquiror or Target if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by the date that is 150 days following the date of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date;

complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement;

  



  

(d) by Acquiror or Target, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the other party

representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement;
provided, however, that the provisions of _Sections _ _6.4_ , _6.5_ , _6.11_
and _10_ shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of Applicable Law, prior to
the Effective Time, the parties hereto may amend this Agreement only by
authorized action at any time before or after the adoption of this Agreement

9. _Indemnification_.

  



  

9.1 _Escrow Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At Closing, Acquiror will deposit, or cause to be deposited, the
Escrow Consideration with the Escrow Agent appointed pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement (the " **Escrow Agent** "). The Escrow Consideration shall be held
as security of the indemnification obligations of the Effective Time Holders
under this _Section_ _9_ , and administered per the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Consideration will be held by the Escrow
Agent for the periods provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement, and any
Escrow Consideration to be distributed to the Effective Time Holders shall be
distributed in accordance with such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata Portion.

  



  

(b) On the date that is twelve (12) months following Closing, the Escrow
Agent will distribute to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with their
Pro Rata Portion, an amount equal to (i) the Escrow Consideration, _minus_
(ii) the aggregate amount of any Damages set forth in an Officer's Certificate
that is timely delivered pursuant to this Agreement and which remain
unresolved at such date, _minus_ (iii) the Retention Amount, to the extent not
already deducted in full from the Escrow Consideration, _minus_ (iv) any
amounts released from the Escrow Consideration to Acquiror pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section_ _9_ following resolution of any claim or claims
made in any Officer's Certificate timely delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
_minus_ (v) $5,000,000 (the " **Continuing** **Escrow** "); provided, further,
however, that if an Acquiror Indemnified Person delivers an Officer's
Certificate to Target within the twelve (12) month period following Closing
with respect to Damages prior to final determination of any amounts such
Acquiror Indemnified Person is entitled to recover under the RandW Insurance
Policies with respect to such claim, any such underlying claim shall survive
the applicable survival period until, following a final determination from the
RandW Insurer, it is finally resolved in accordance with this Section 9, and
such claim amount specified in such Officer's Certificate shall not be
distributed to the Effective Time Holders. Target further acknowledges and
agrees that the denial of any claim by any Acquiror Indemnified Person under
the RandW Insurance Policies shall not be construed as, or used as evidence
that, such Acquiror Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified,
compensated or reimbursed under this Section 9.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) On the date that is twenty-four (24) months following Closing, the
Escrow Agent will distribute to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with
their Pro Rata Portion, an amount equal to (i) the remaining Escrow
Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of any Damages set forth in
an Officer's Certificate that is timely delivered pursuant to this Agreement
seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(vi) or Section 9.2(a)(ix)
only, in each case which remain unresolved at such date, _minus_ (iii) the
Retention Amount, to the extent not already deducted in full from the Escrow
Consideration.

  



  

(d) To the extent any amount is withheld in the Escrow Fund pursuant to
the proviso in _Section_ _9.1(b)_ or _(c),_ on the date that is thirty-six
(36) months following Closing, the Escrow Agent will distribute to the
Effective Time Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, an amount
equal to (i) the remaining Escrow Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the unused
portion of the Retention Amount.

  



  

9.2 _Indemnification by the Effective Time Holders_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section _ _9_ , the
Effective Time Holders shall severally, in accordance with each Effective Time
Holder's Pro Rata Portion, and not jointly, indemnify, reimburse and hold
harmless Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers,
directors, stockholders, members, agents, Affiliates, attorneys,
representatives, successors, permitted assigns and employees, and each Person,
if any, who controls or may control Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
within the meaning of the Securities Act (individually an " **Acquiror
Indemnified Person** " and collectively the " **Acquiror Indemnified Persons**
") from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties, Taxes and expenses, including costs and expenses
arising from investigations, claims, demands, actions, causes of action and
settlements, including reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, experts and
other professionals incurred in the defense or prosecution of any
indemnifiable claims under this Section 9 (collectively, " **Damages** "),
resulting from or arising out of:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy in or misrepresentation or breach of any of the
representations and warranties given or made by Target in this Agreement, the
Target Disclosure Schedule or any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement or in
any certificate or document furnished pursuant hereto by Target to Acquiror,
without giving effect to any update of or modification to the Target
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after the date of this
Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Target or its Subsidiaries in this Agreement or
in any certificate, instrument or agreement delivered in connection herewith;

  



  

   

  



  

(iii) the exercise by any Dissenting Stockholder of appraisal or
dissenters' rights under the Delaware Law or other Applicable Law in excess of
the Per Share Amount for each such share;

  



  

(iv) any claim by a Stockholder or former Stockholder of Target, or any
current or former holder of options, warrants or other rights to purchase
Target Capital Stock in their capacity as a Stockholder or holder of options,
warrants or other rights to purchase Target Capital Stock;

  



  

(v) any inaccuracies in the Payment Schedule, including, for the sake of
clarity, in the calculation of the components of Closing Merger Consideration
and Net Working Capital

  



  

(vi) fifty percent (50%) of any Spinoza Transaction Taxes in excess of
the Spinoza Transaction Taxes that were actually paid or accrued by Target as
of the Closing;

  



  

(vii) any liabilities relating to or arising out of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code;

  



  

(viii) any third-party claims against Target or its Subsidiaries alleging
facts that, if true, would constitute a breach of Target's or its
Subsidiaries' representations, warranties or covenants;

  



  

(ix) Fraud by or on behalf of Target;

  



  

(x) the Specified Matters;

  



  

(xi) any Spinoza Indemnity Obligation; and

  



  

(xii) the RandW Insurance Policy Exclusions.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the purposes
of the determination of Damages pursuant to _Section _ _9_ , the
representations and warranties of Target in this Agreement that are qualified
by materiality or Material Adverse Effect or similar words shall be deemed to
be made without such materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. The
Effective Time Holders shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from Target, the Surviving Corporation
or Acquiror with respect to any Damages claimed by an Acquiror Indemnified
Person.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The Specified Matters
and all representations and warranties made by Target herein, or in any
certificate, schedule or exhibit delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing and shall survive
until the date that is twelve (12) months following Closing; provided,
however, that any claims for indemnification involving (i) any breach of any
of the Fundamental Representations, other than _Section_ _3.5_ (Capital
Structure), shall survive Closing until thirty (30) days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and (ii) (A) _Section_
_3.5_ (Capital Structure), and (B) the matters under _Section_ _
____9.2(a)(ii)_ to _9.2(a)(ix)_ , and _Section_ _9.2(a)(xi)_ to _Section_
_9.2(a)(xii)_ shall survive indefinitely, and, in each case of (i) and (ii),
shall also survive thereafter until resolved if a claim in respect thereof has
been made prior to the applicable date with respect to such matters. There
shall be no termination of any representation or warranty as to which a claim
has been asserted by Acquiror prior to the later of the resolution of such
claim or termination of such survival period. All covenants and agreements, as
well as the matters set forth in _Section_ _9.9_ , survive indefinitely unless
otherwise specified in their terms. The parties acknowledge that the time
periods set forth in this _Section_ _9_ and elsewhere in this Agreement for
the assertion of claims and notices under this Agreement are the result of
arms'-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time
periods to be enforced as agreed hereunder by the parties. The parties further
acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this _Section_ _9_ and
elsewhere in the Agreement may be shorter than otherwise provided by law.

  



  

(c) _Cap on Indemnification by Effective Time Holders_. The aggregate
amount to be paid by the Effective Time Holders for claims for Damages made
under _Section_ _ ____9.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed the Escrow Consideration
(the " **Cap** "); provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to any
Damages based upon claims for indemnification involving (i) Fraud, (ii) any
breach of the Fundamental Representations, (iii) the matters under _Section_ _
____9.2(a)(ii)_ to 9.2(a)(x) (together with (i) and (ii), the " **Fundamental
Claims** "), and (iv) the matters under Section 9.2(a)(xi) and (xii); provided
further that the Cap shall apply with respect to any indemnification claim
under Section 9.2(a)(viii) if the underlying third party claim is subject to
the Cap. With respect to Fundamental Claims, the liability of each Effective
Time Holder shall not exceed the portion of the Merger Consideration actually
received by such Effective Time Holder; provided, that for the avoidance of
doubt, the aggregate amount to be paid by a particular Effective Time Holder
for a claim involving Fraud committed by or with the actual knowledge of such
Effective Time Holder shall not be capped. With respect to the matters under
Section 9.2(a)(xi) (the " **Spinoza Claims** "), the liability of each
Effective Time Holder shall not exceed such Effective Time Holder's Pro Rata
Portion of the Spinoza Indemnity Cap (inclusive of any portion of the Escrow
Consideration payable in respect of a Spinoza Claim), and Acquiror shall have
no right to seek indemnification from the Effective Time Holders for
Acquiror's portion of the Spinoza Indemnity Obligation. With respect to the
matters under Section 9.2(a)(xii) (the " **R andW Exclusion Claims**"), the
liability of each Effective Time Holder shall not exceed such Effective Time
Holder's Pro Rata Portion of $24,000,000; provided, however if any RandW
Exclusion Claims include matters that would otherwise be covered by a
Fundamental Representation, then as to that matter, the liability of each
Effective Time Holder shall not exceed the portion of the Merger Consideration
actually received by such Effective Time Holder.

  



  

(d) _Limitations_.

  



  

(i) _Basket_. Subject to _Section _ _9.2(d)(ii)_ , the Effective Time
Holders shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to
_Section_ _9.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement unless and until such time as the total amount of
all Damages (including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach and
all other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any
representations or warranties) that have been suffered or incurred by any one
or more of the Acquiror Indemnified Persons exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate
(the " **Basket** "). Additionally, the Basket shall apply with respect to any
indemnification claim made under _Section 9.2(a)(vii_ _i_ _)_ if the
underlying third party claim is subject to the Basket, and the losses from
such indemnification claim shall count toward the Basket. If the total amount
of such Damages exceeds the Basket, then the Acquiror Indemnified Persons
shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for
the amount of all Damages including the Basket.

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) _Applicability of_ _Basket_. The limitations set forth in _Section_
_9.2(d)(i)_ shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other
obligations of any Effective Time Holder): (i) in the event of Fraud; (ii) to
inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations; (iii)
to any of the matters referred to in _Section_ _9.2(a)(ii)_ through _Section
9.2(a)(xii)_ , inclusive.

  



  

(iii) _Remedies_. Subject to _Section_ _9.2(d)(i)_ and the applicable
limits of this _Section 9_ generally, the Acquiror Indemnified Persons shall
make any claim for indemnification under this _Section_ _9_ as follows: first,
against the Escrow Fund for purposes of satisfying the Retention Amount or for
Fundamental Claims, Spinoza Claims and RandW Exclusion Claims; second, against
the RandW Insurance Policies to the fullest extent permitted thereby; third,
against the Escrow Fund for purposes of satisfying any claims rejected under
the RandW Insurance Policies; and fourth, to the extent recovery against the RandW
Insurance Policies were available but insufficient to provide indemnification
for the full amount of such Damages, against the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or otherwise set forth herein, with the exception of
indemnification for Fundamental Claims, recovery from the RandW Insurance
Policies and the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement for Damages under Section 9.2(a)(i). If a claim for indemnification
relates to a Fundamental Claim, Spinoza Claim or RandW Exclusion Claim, then
following the making of a claim against the RandW Insurance Policies and Escrow
Fund as provided above and as applicable, the Acquiror Indemnified Persons may
make claims against the Effective Time Holders to the extent permitted by this
_Section 9_.

  



  

(iv) _Exclusive Remedy_. This _Section_ _9_ and _Section_ _10.9_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Acquiror Indemnified Persons from and
after the Closing Date for any claims arising under this Agreement, including
but not limited to claims of inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty and whether any claim for Damages is based on contract, tort, or
otherwise, it being understood that this provision shall not preclude claims
against the RandW Insurance Policies; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing
sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any party hereto of any right to
injunctive relief pursuant to equitable Law or any other non-monetary
equitable remedy. The obligations of the Effective Time Holders under this
_Section_ _9_ and _Section_ _10.9_ shall not be reduced, offset, eliminated or
subject to contribution by reason of any action or inaction by the Target that
contributed to any inaccuracy or breach giving rise to such obligation, it
being understood that the Effective Time Holders, not the Target, shall have
the sole obligation for the indemnification or other obligations under this
_Section_ _9_ and _Section 10.9_.

  



  

   

  



  

(v) _Insurance Proceeds_. In calculating amounts payable to any Acquiror
Indemnified Person hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Damages shall be
determined net of any amounts actually recovered by any Acquiror Indemnified
Person (or its Affiliates) under the RandW Insurance Policies, other insurance
policies or other third parties with respect to such Damages. If payment from
the RandW Insurance Policies, other insurance policy or other third party is
received by an Acquiror Indemnified Person after indemnification is received
by such Acquiror Indemnified Person hereunder, such Acquiror Indemnified
Person shall promptly pay to the Securityholders' Agent for distribution to
the Effective Time Holders the amount recovered by it from the RandW Insurance
Policies or other third party for which such Acquiror Indemnified Person had
been indemnified hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Acquiror
Indemnified Person will not be required to refund amounts actually received
under the RandW Insurance Policies to the extent such Acquiror Indemnified
Person's total Damages exceed the limits under the RandW Insurance Policies.

  



  

(vi) _No Double Recovery_. If and solely to the extent that an amount of
Damages in connection with an indemnifiable matter was already taken into
account in connection with the calculation of the Merger Consideration, the
amount of such Damages as was already used to reduce the Merger Consideration
may not be recovered again under this _Section_ _9_. No Acquiror Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to double recovery for any indemnifiable Damages,
even though such Damages may be indemnifiable under more than one provision of
this Agreement.

  



  

(vii) _Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Effective Time Holders shall not be liable for the ability
of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to utilize any Tax asset or attribute of
Target (e.g., net operating loss, net operating carryforwards or credits)
after the Closing.

  



  

9.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

  



  

(a) A claim for indemnification under this _Section _ _9_ shall be made
by Acquiror by delivering to the Securityholders' Agent, on or before the end
of the applicable survival period for a particular claim as set forth in this
_Section _ _9_ , a certificate signed by any officer of Acquiror (an "
**Officer 's Certificate**") stating that Damages exist with respect to the
indemnification obligations of the Effective Time Holders, and specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of such Damages included in the amount
so stated, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty,
covenant or claim to which such item is related. The amount of the Damages
claimed in the Officer's Certificate shall not be released from escrow to the
Effective Time Holders until resolved pursuant to the terms hereof.

  



  

(b) If the Securityholders' Agent does not contest, by written notice to
Acquiror, the Damages claimed by Acquiror in any Officer's Certificate within
thirty (30) Business Days after any such Officer's Certificate is received by
the Securityholders' Agent, then the Securityholders' Agent will be
conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf of all Effective Time
Holders, to the recovery by the Acquiror Indemnified Persons of the full
amount of Losses specified in the Officer's Certificate, including the
forfeiture of such amount from the Escrow Consideration (subject to the terms
and conditions in this _Section _ _9_ ) having a value sufficient to satisfy
such Damages and, without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a
final judgment for the Damages against the Securityholders' Agent for such
amount in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) If the Securityholders' Agent disputes any claim or claims made in any
Officer's Certificate by providing written notice thereof to Acquiror, within
thirty (30) Business Days of receiving the Officer's Certificate, specifying
in reasonable detail the individual items in dispute and the nature of the
dispute, Acquiror shall have thirty (30) Business Days to respond in a written
statement to the objection of the Securityholders' Agent. If after such thirty
(30) Business Days period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
Securityholders' Agent and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith for an
additional thirty (30) Business Days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Securityholders' Agent and Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by Acquiror and the
Securityholders' Agent.

  



  

9.4 _Resolution of Conflicts_. If no agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiations between the parties pursuant to _Section _ _9.2(d)_ , such
dispute (a " **Claim Dispute** ") shall be settled pursuant to _Section_
_10.6_. The decision of a court as to the validity and amount of any Claim
Dispute in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in _Section _ _9_
hereof, the parties shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision.

  



  

9.5 _Securityholders ' Agent_.

  



  

(a) The Securityholders' Agent shall be constituted and appointed as
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Effective Time
Holders and shall have full power authority to represent, to give and receive
notices and communications, to authorize the release of any portion of the
Escrow Consideration to Acquiror in satisfaction of claims under this
Agreement by Acquiror, to object to such releases, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims,
to act on the Effective Time Holders' behalf with respect to the matters set
forth herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Securityholders' Agent
Engagement Agreement, in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth
herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Securityholders' Agent Engagement
Agreement, including giving and receiving all notices and communications to be
given or received with respect to the matters set forth in this _Section_ _9_
and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Securityholders' Agent for the interpretation of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Securityholders' Agent Engagement Agreement and
accomplishment of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Securityholders' Agent shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders, except as expressly provided herein, in the Escrow
Agreement **** and in the **** Securityholders' Agent Engagement Agreement,
and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholders'
Agent in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Target Disclosure
Schedule. The Securityholders' Agent may resign at any time and such agency
may be changed by the vote of Effective Time Holders representing a majority
in interest of the Escrow Consideration from time to time upon not less than
ten (10) days' prior written notice to Acquiror. The immunities and rights to
indemnification between the Effective Time Holders and the Securityholders'
Agent and Advisory Group shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders' Agent or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing
and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. No bond
shall be required of the Securityholders' Agent. Notices or communications to
or from the Securityholders' Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of
the Effective Time Holders.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Certain Effective Time Holders have entered into an engagement
agreement (the " **Securityholders ' Agent Engagement Agreement**") with the
Securityholders' Agent to provide direction to the Securityholders' Agent in
connection with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement ****
and the Securityholders' Agent Engagement Agreement (such Effective Time
Holders, including their individual representatives, collectively hereinafter
referred to as the " **Advisory Group** "). Neither the Securityholders' Agent
nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and
employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "
**Securityholders ' Agent Group**") shall be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the Securityholders'
Agent Engagement Agreement as Securityholders' Agent while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith. The Effective Time Holders shall severally, in accordance with their
Pro Rata Portion, indemnify, defend and hold the Securityholders' Agent Group
harmless against any claim, damage, fee, cost, loss, liability or expense
(including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled
professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, the "
**Securityholders ' Agent** **Expenses** ") incurred without gross negligence
or bad faith on the part of the Securityholders' Agent and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder
under the Escrow Agreement or under the Securityholders' Agent Engagement
Agreement. Such Securityholders' Agent **** Expenses may be recovered first,
from the Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of the Escrow Fund
otherwise distributable to the Effective Time Holders at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the Effective Time Holders. The
Effective Time Holders acknowledge that the Securityholders' Agent shall not
be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Securityholders'
Agent shall not be required to take any action unless the Securityholders'
Agent has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its
determination, are sufficient to protect the Securityholders' Agent against
the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Securityholders' Agent in performing such actions.

  



  

(c) Upon the Closing, Acquiror shall wire to the Securityholders' Agent
$250,000 (the " **Expense Fund Amount ")**. The Expense Fund Amount shall be
held by the Securityholders' Agent in a segregated client account and shall be
used (i) for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the
Securityholders' Agent for any Securityholders' Agent **** Expenses incurred
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Securityholders' Agent
Engagement Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group
(the " **Expense Fund** "). The Securityholders' Agent is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders' Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or
income distribution obligations. The Effective Time Holders will not receive
any interest on the Expense Fund and assign to the Securityholders' Agent any
such interest. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Securityholders' Agent
may contribute funds to the Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise
distributable to the Effective Time Holders. As soon as reasonably determined
by the Securityholders' Agent that the Expense Fund is no longer required to
be withheld, the Securityholders' Agent shall distribute the remaining Expense
Fund (if any) to the Payment Agent and/or Acquiror, as applicable **,** for
further distribution to the Effective Time Holders.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) The Securityholders' Agent shall have reasonable access to information
about Target and the Target Subsidiaries and the reasonable assistance of
Target's and the Target's Subsidiaries' officers and employees for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the
Securityholders' Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any
nonpublic information from or about Target or any Target Subsidiary to anyone
(except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
information confidentially). The Securityholders' Agent shall be entitled to:
(i) rely upon the Payment Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by
it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Effective Time Holder or
other party.

  



  

9.6 _Actions of the Securityholders ' Agent_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholders' Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Effective Time Holders for whom the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
them is released to Acquiror from the Escrow Consideration or otherwise with
respect to the matters set forth herein and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each Effective Time Holder and such Effective Time Holder's
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Effective
Time Holder, and all defenses which may be available to any Effective Time
Holder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Securityholders'
Agent taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement **** or
the Securityholders' Agent Engagement Agreement are waived. Acquiror may rely
upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders' Agent
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every Effective
Time Holder. Acquiror is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for
any acts done by Acquiror in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholders' Agent. The powers, immunities and rights
to indemnification granted to the Securityholders' Agent **** Group hereunder
by the Effective Time Holders: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of
any Effective Time Holder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and
(ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Effective Time Holder
of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.

  



  

9.7 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a third-
party claim or legal proceeding which Acquiror believes may result in Damages,
Acquiror shall notify the Securityholders' Agent of such claim or legal
proceeding. The Securityholders' Agent shall be entitled, at the expense of
the Effective Time Holders, to participate in, but not determine or conduct,
the defense of such claim or legal proceeding and Acquiror shall keep the
Securityholders' Agent reasonably apprised of material developments in such
claim or legal proceeding, and promptly provide to the Securityholders' Agent
copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such claim
or legal proceeding to the extent that receipt of such documents does not
waive any privilege. Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to
defend or settle any such claim. In the event that the Securityholders' Agent
has consented to any such settlement, the Securityholders' Agent shall have no
power or authority to object under _Section _ _9.2(d)_ or any other provision
of this _Section _ _9_ to the amount of any claim by Acquiror against the
Escrow Consideration for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

  



  

   

  



  

9.8 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All amounts received by the
Acquiror Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Section_ _9_ shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  



  

9.9 _Tax Indemnification_. In addition to the indemnification obligations
set forth in _Section _ _9.2_ above, the Effective Time Holders shall
severally, in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, indemnify the Acquiror
Indemnified Persons and hold them harmless from and against any Damages
resulting from or arising out of (a) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of
Target for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the
portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Straddle Period (" **Pre-
Closing Tax Period** "), (b) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Target (or any predecessor of
Target) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant
to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
non-U.S. law or regulation, and (c) any and all Taxes of or imposed on
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including Target or any of its
Subsidiaries) for any taxable year of such Acquiror or Affiliate that includes
the Closing Date as a result of an inclusion under Section 951(a) or 951A of
the Code (or any similar provision of state or local law) attributable to (i)
"subpart F income," within the meaning of Section 952 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state or local law) determined as if the taxable year of
Target or the applicable Subsidiary and the applicable foreign corporation
ended on the Closing Date, (ii) the holding of "United States property,"
within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code (or any similar provision of
state or local Applicable Law) on or prior to the Closing Date that is
attributable to Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) "global intangible
low-taxed income" as defined in Section 951A of the Code determined as if the
taxable year of Target or the applicable Subsidiary and the applicable foreign
corporation ended on the Closing Date and, in each case, taking into account
any net operating losses or similar Tax attributes of the Target and its
Subsidiaries that would have been available to offset such inclusion if the
taxable years of Target and its Subsidiaries had ended on the Closing Date,
(d) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on Target as a transferee or
successor, by contract or pursuant to any Applicable Law, which Taxes relate
to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, provided, however,
that for the avoidance of doubt, the employer's share of all employment,
payroll and similar Taxes incurred by Target in relation to the Change of
Control Liability, whether such Taxes are incurred prior to, at, or following
the Effective Time, shall be treated as arising in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and shall be a Transaction Expense and (e) any and all Taxes of any Person
imposed on Target or Acquiror in connection with the Spinoza Purchase
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The liability of each
Effective Time Holder under this _Section_ _9.9_ shall not exceed the portion
of the Merger Consideration actually received by each Effective Time Holder.
To the extent that any Damages claimed in an Officer's Certificate pursuant to
this _Section_ _9.9_ overlaps with a claim for Damages pursuant to _Section _
_9.2_ , the provisions set forth in this _Section_ _9.9_ and the provisions
applicable to this _Section_ _9.9_ shall govern and control.

  



  

   

  



  

9.10 _Effect of Investigation_. The right to indemnification, payment of
Damages or for other remedies based on any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation of Target and/or the Effective Time Holders contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time by Acquiror or its Representatives, whether before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the date the Closing
occurs, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any
condition to the obligation of Acquiror to consummate the Merger, where such
condition is based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not
affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based
on such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

10.2 _Counterparts; Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart and such
signatures may be delivered by facsimile signature, PDF or any electronic
signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000.

  



  

10.3 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This
Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits and
schedules hereto, including the Target Disclosure Schedule: (a) together
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force
and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the
Closing, in accordance with its terms; and (b) except for the provisions of
_Section_ _6.15_ (which are for the benefit of the Target Indemnified Parties)
and _Section_ _9_ (which are for the benefit of the Acquiror Indemnified
Persons), are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder and shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise
without the written consent of the other party.

  



  

10.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

10.5 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

   

  



  

10.6 _Governing Law; Dispute Resolutions_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws of California, without regard applicable principles of
conflicts of law.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement, _Section_ _9.3_
, or _Section_ _9.4_ , any action, suit or other legal proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement
(including an action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon Fraud) shall
be brought or otherwise commenced exclusively in any federal or state court
located in the State of California. Each party to this Agreement: (i)
expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of and venue in each federal or state court located in the State of California
(and each appellate court located in the State of California) in connection
with any such action, suit or legal proceeding; (ii) agrees that each federal
or state court located in the State of California shall be deemed to be a
convenient forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise), in any such action, suit or other legal proceeding
commenced in any federal or state court located in the State of California,
any claim that such party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of
such court, that such action, suit or other legal proceeding has been brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such action, suit or other legal
proceeding is improper, that challenges the application of the internal laws
of the State of California as set forth in _Section_ _10.6(a)_ , or that this
Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by
such court.

  



  

Any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to
_Section_ _9_ shall be brought and resolved exclusively in accordance with
_Section_ _9.3_ and _Section_ _9.4_.

  



  

10.7 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

  



  

10.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution
of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

  



  

10.9 _Specific Enforcement_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other would be irreparably harmed and would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by such other party in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly each party agrees that the other party shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

   

  



  

10.10 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any amendment or waiver of any of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and must be duly executed by
or on behalf of the party to be charged with such waiver. The failure of a
party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict
adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a later
date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term of condition
hereof (whether or not similar).

  



  

10.11 _Interpretation_.

  



  

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

  



  

(b) The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall
be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."

  



  

(d) Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of
any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; and (iii) the
terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and derivative or similar words refer to
this entire Agreement.

  



  

(e) All references to " **$** " herein shall mean U.S. dollars.

  



  

10.12 _Consent to Representation; Confidential Communications_. If the
Securityholders' Agent so desires, acting on behalf of the Effective Time
Holders and without the need for any consent or waiver by Target, Acquiror,
Merger Sub, Fenwick and West LLP (" **Fenwick** ") shall be permitted to
represent the Effective Time Holders after the Closing in connection with any
matter, including any matter related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any other agreements referenced herein or any disagreement or
dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
after the Closing, Fenwick shall be permitted to represent the Effective Time
Holders, any of their agents and Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in
connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute (including any
litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their agents or Affiliates under or relating
to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any
related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with respect to any
indemnification claims. Acquiror, Merger Sub and Target further agree that, as
to all communications among Fenwick, Target, the board of directors of Target,
the Securityholders' Agent and the Effective Time Holders and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " **Seller Group** ") that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Spinoza Purchase Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the exception of
client confidence belongs solely to Acquiror; provided that Acquiror agrees,
solely with respect to any claim for indemnification made by Acquiror or any
other Acquiror Indemnified Person under _Section 9_ , not to (i) invoke any
attendant attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection or
expectation of client confidentiality applicable to confidential
communications between the Seller Group, Target and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Fenwick, on the other hand, or (ii) use such
confidential communications as evidence in any dispute with the Seller Group
in connection with any such claim for indemnification.
