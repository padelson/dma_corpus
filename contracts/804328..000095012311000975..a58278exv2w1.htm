 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of January 5, 2011 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), T MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and ATHEROS COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ " and, together with Parent and Sub, collectively, the " _Parties_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub unanimously deems it in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have unanimously approved this Agreement, declared its advisability and recommended that this Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company or Sub, as the case may be; and 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _THE MERGER_  

  

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., California time, on a date to be specified by the Parties, which shall be not later than the third business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in 

      ##### 

  

    

writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, but for
this proviso, the Closing would have occurred on a Specified Quarter End
Date, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day that is in
the subsequent fiscal quarter of Parent or on such other date to be specified
by the Parties (it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall
remain subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI at the Closing). The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_
". 

   

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time of the Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Parties shall properly file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ". 

   

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

   

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

       ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE II 

   

 _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_  

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0005 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub: 

    

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or owned by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) except as provided in Section 2.04, the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $45.00 in cash and without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax Law, such withholding to be pursuant to the terms of Section 2.05(f) and any applicable tax Law. 

  

 SECTION 2.02. _Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the following: 

    

 (i) each Stock Option shall be converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Stock Option (other than with respect to exercisability prior to vesting), the number of shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest 

   ##### 

  

   

whole share), determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Stock
Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , _however_ , that each
outstanding vested Stock Option held by a current or former non-employee
director of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
those the vesting of which accelerates upon the effectiveness of the Merger,
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive, as soon
as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(as accelerated) and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable

 (b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required so that (i) participation in the ESPP shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (iii) no contribution period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iv) the ESPP shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the first purchase date following the date of this Agreement and the last business day before the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the ESPP) or such last business day (as provided for in the following clause (v)), as applicable, and (v) if the ESPP remains in effect on the last business day before the Effective Time, each purchase right under the ESPP outstanding on such day shall be automatically exercised by applying the payroll deductions of each then current participant in the ESPP for the then current contribution period in effect under the ESPP to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the ESPP regarding the maximum number and value of shares purchasable per participant) at the applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP for such contribution period, using such day as the purchase date for such contribution period.

 SECTION 2.03. _Warrants._ (a) Each Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall be canceled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such 

      ##### 

  

    

Warrant and (y) the Merger Consideration, minus (ii) the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant and (y) the
per share exercise price of such Warrant. The payments specified above in
this Section 2.03(a) are referred to herein as the " _Warrant Cancelation
Payments_ ". Parent shall cause Sub or the Surviving Corporation to make such
Warrant Cancelation Payments at or promptly following the Closing upon receipt
by Parent of the applicable Warrant and such other documents as Parent may
reasonably request. 

   

 (b) The Company shall take all such actions (including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to ensure that (i) effective as of the Closing, all Warrants may be canceled solely in exchange for a Warrant Cancelation Payment to the extent required by Section 2.03(a) and (ii) following the Closing, no holder of a Warrant (or former holder of a Warrant) shall have any right thereunder (x) to acquire any capital stock of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other equity or voting interest therein or (y) to put all or any portion of the Warrants to the Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries.

 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest. 

   

 SECTION 2.04. _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make 

      ##### 

  

    

any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 SECTION 2.05. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate, at its option, U.S. Bank National Association or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) the Appraisal Shares), funds in the amount necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent (such funds being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and any and all interest and other income or net profits resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), upon demand by the Paying Agent, Parent shall promptly reimburse, or shall cause the prompt reimbursement of, any such loss so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall include an accompanying substitute IRS Form W-9 or the applicable IRS Form W-8, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, and Parent will instruct the Paying Agent to so mail such form of letter of transmittal and instructions no more than two business days after the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting 

      ##### 

  

    

such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate which is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any Merger Consideration payable in accordance with this Article II in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or Warrant Cancelation Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or a Warrant, as applicable, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of 

      ##### 

  

    

Company Common Stock or the holder of the Warrant, as applicable, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Fund._ At any time following the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter, subject to time limitations in Section 2.05(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

   ##### 

  

   

with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, and the terms of any
collective bargaining agreements or other labor union Contracts. 

   

 (ii) Each Pension Plan intended to be tax qualified under the Code is so qualified and has been the subject of a favorable determination, qualification or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect to all tax Law changes with respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide a determination letter to the effect that such Pension Plan is qualified and exempt from U.S. federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such letter has been revoked (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent such letter or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such Pension Plan or increase the costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA.

 (iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides welfare benefits, whether or not subject to ERISA (each, a " _Welfare Plan_ "), is funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of

the Code), or is unfunded or self-insured. There are no
understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that would

 (vii) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to each Benefit Plan required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or distributed to any Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed.

 (viii) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection with each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement that are required to have been made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with

 (x) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation, including under or on account of a Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (xi) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have any liability in excess of $10,000, any Benefit Plan that is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States (all such Contracts, collectively, " _Foreign Benefit Plans_ ") required to have been approved by any foreign Governmental Entity has been so approved, no such approval has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened, and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent approval with respect to such Foreign Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to affect such approval or status.

the knowledge of the Company, no current or former consultant or independent
contractor is in violation of any term of any such agreement and no current
or former consultant or independent contractor is in violation of or breach
of any term(s) of any agreement or contract with any existing or
former employer and any consent required to be obtained from any such
employer in connection with any such consultants or independent contractors
work for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, was properly obtained. 

   

 (B) All authors of any works of authorship in the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Products have waived their moral rights and have agreed to a covenant not to assert their moral rights, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, or such authors prepared such works in jurisdictions that do not recognize moral rights. 

   

 (C) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not disclosed or delivered to any person, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other person, of any Source Code. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery to any person of any Source Code. 

   

 (xiii) Except with respect to demonstration or trial copies, to the knowledge of the Company, no product, system, program or software module designed, developed, distributed, licensed or otherwise made available by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any person, including any Product, contains any "back door," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "worm," "drop dead device," "virus" or other software routines or hardware components designed to permit unauthorized access or to disable or erase software, hardware or data without the consent of the user. 

   

 (xiv) The Company and its Subsidiaries are not and have never been, and no previous owner of any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has ever been, a member or promoter of, or a contributor to or made any commitments or agreements regarding any patent pool, industry standards body, standard setting organization, industry or other trade association or similar organization, in each case that could or does require or obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant or offer to any other person any license or right to any Intellectual Property, including any future Intellectual Property developed, conceived, made or reduced to practice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (xv) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Entity were used, directly or indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or in part, any 

   ##### 

  

    

Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Product. 

   

 (xvi) The execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not contravene, conflict with or result in any limitation in any material respect on Parents right, title or interest in or to any Intellectual Property owned or licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (xvii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintained, consistent with commercially reasonable practices and its obligations to third persons, security and other measures adequate to protect computers, networks, software and systems used by the Company and its Subsidiaries to store, process or transmit information or content from unauthorized access, use or modification. 

   

 (q) _Insurance._ The Company or its Subsidiaries maintain all material policies of fire and casualty, liability and other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles and against such risks and losses that are adequate for the operation of the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses. Section 3.01(q) of the Company Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a complete and correct list of the material insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries and the annualized premium payable with respect to each such policy. All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, and no notice of cancelation or termination has been received with respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on substantially similar terms prior to the date of such cancelation. There is no material claim pending under any such policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed. 

   

 (r) _Unlawful Payments._ Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the agents, representatives, franchisees or distributors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, acting in their capacities as such, has taken any action, directly or indirectly, that violated the FCPA. The Company has entered into written agreements with its agents, representatives, franchisees and distributors that require those parties to comply with the FCPA. There have been no false or fictitious entries made in the books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any payment that the FCPA prohibits, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has established or maintained a secret or unrecorded fund for use in making any such payments. As used in this Agreement, the " _FCPA_ " means the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended from time to time. 

   

 (s) _State Takeover Statutes._ Assuming the representations of Parent and Sub set forth in Section 3.02 are accurate, the approval of the Merger by the 

   ##### 

  

   

Board of Directors of the Company referred to in Section 3.01(d) constitutes
the only action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance
with the terms of this Agreement, the restrictions on "business combinations"
(as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL
to the extent, if any, such restrictions would otherwise be applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or compliance with the terms of this Agreement. No other state
takeover or similar statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (t) _Voting Requirements._ Assuming the representations of Parent and Sub set forth in Section 3.02 are accurate, the Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (u) _Brokers; Fees and Expenses._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other than Qatalyst Partners LP, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries, is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 (v) _Opinion of Financial Advisor._ The Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP, financial advisor to the Company, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of the Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent) pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. A signed copy of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners LP will be delivered to Parent promptly after receipt thereof by the Company.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub, as applicable, and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement do not and will not (i) violate or conflict with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws of Parent or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Sub, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of a material benefit under, any Contract or Permit to or by which Parent or Sub is a party or bound or to or by which any of their respective properties or assets are subject or bound or otherwise under which Parent or Sub has rights or benefits, (iii) result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) in or upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Sub or (iv) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, violate or conflict with any Law (assuming receipt of the Stockholder Approval and the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub) or Judgment, in each case, applicable to Parent or Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancelations, accelerations, losses, Liens, rights or entitlements that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Sub in connection

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and (C) such

declarations, filings and notices, the failure of which to be obtained or
made, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
impair in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, as amended or supplemented at such date or time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

   

 (d) _Interim Operations of Sub._ Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in no business other than in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Resources_ _._ Parent and Sub collectively have, and will have at the Effective Time and from time to time thereafter as required by this Agreement, access to sufficient cash resources to pay the amounts required to be paid by them under this Agreement, including payment in full of the Merger Consideration and the Warrant Cancelation Payments, and to pay all of their associated fees, costs and expenses.

None of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates is, nor at any time during the last three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). 

   #####

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or 

   ##### 

  

 

any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 4.02(a) by the Company. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, in one transaction or a series of transactions, any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution involving the Company or any direct or indirect acquisition, including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement (other than any license agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in connection with the sale of the products of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or similar transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 20% or more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of the Company, or securities exchangeable for or convertible into 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of the Company, or (iii) 20% or more of any class of the outstanding equity of or voting interests in, or convertible debt or convertible securities convertible into 20% or more of any class of the equity of or voting interests in, any of the Subsidiaries of the Company directly or indirectly holding, individually or taken together, the assets or businesses referred to in clause (i) above. 

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer which did not result from a breach of Section 4.02(a) made by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of their affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person (or, in the case of a direct merger between such person and the Company, the stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), (i) is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including the need for and contingency of any financing). 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (or shall agree or resolve to) (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger (any such action, resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _Change_ "), (ii) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend or
declare advisable, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or
resolve or agree to take any such action, or adopt or approve any Takeover
Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)), or resolve or
agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may, (x) in response to an Intervening Event, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (y) in response to a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 4.02,
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and concurrently enter into an
Acquisition Agreement; and _provided_   _further_ that the Board of Directors
of the Company may not (1) effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change or
(2) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f), unless (A)
the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior written
notice to Parent that it is prepared to, in the case of clause (1) above,
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event
(an " _Adverse Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being understood that an
Adverse Recommendation Change Notice in and of itself shall not constitute
an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice shall attach information
describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, or, in the case of
clause (2) above, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood that a Notice
of Superior Proposal in and of itself shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change), which notice shall attach the terms and conditions
(including the most current version of any written agreement) relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent does not
make, within five business days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal
in writing that would, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
of the Company (after consultation with a financial advisor of national
reputation and outside legal counsel), (x) obviate the need for an Adverse
Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening Event or (y) cause the
offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment or
modification of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new three business day period), as applicable. The Company
agrees that, during the five or three business day period, as applicable,
prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f), the Company and its officers,
directors and representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its officers, directors and representatives regarding any revisions to the
terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, development or change in circumstances occurring, arising or coming to the 

    ##### 

 

  

attention of the Board of Directors of the Company after the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, which causes the
Board of Directors of the Company to conclude in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that its failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal
or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an
Intervening Event. 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such material terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the Company shall (A) keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the progress of negotiations concerning any Takeover Proposal, including causing its legal and financial advisors to confer on a daily basis (but for no more than one hour on each day, and at a time specified by the Company in a notice provided to Parent at least 8 hours in advance or at such other time as both Parties shall agree) with the legal and financial advisors to Parent if so requested by Parent by no later than 9:00 a.m., California time, on any given day (which shall include responding to any reasonable questions posed by the legal or financial advisors to Parent) regarding the material terms and status of such negotiations, (B) promptly advise Parent of any amendments as to price and other material terms of any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (C) promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all drafts and final versions (and any amendments thereto) of transaction documents (including schedules of the Company, material exhibits, offer letters, bid letters and letters of intent) containing any material terms or conditions, in each case, relating to any such Takeover Proposal (including the financing thereof), and exchanged between the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the one hand, and the person making a Takeover Proposal or any of its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the other hand. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (including any "stop-look-and-listen" communication that contains only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that 

   ##### 

  

 

in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section
4.02(b). 

   

 SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent._ During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in (a) any representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect.

Each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the preliminary Proxy Statement to be cleared with the SEC as promptly as practicable after such filing. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such action, the Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement, and shall cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, on or prior to the 10th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately following the date of filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC, prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to 

   ##### 

  

 

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the

 (b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting the Company shall, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing such action, cause to occur on the 20th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately following the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval, unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with its terms but otherwise regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it or any other Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its stockholders at such time, the Company may extend the date of the Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly as practicable and (ii) the Company may delay the Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is required by applicable Law to comply with comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The notice of such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b), (x) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (y) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the Stockholder Approval. Unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation for the Stockholders Meeting (including interim results) as reasonably requested by Parent. 

  

 (c) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that none of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except 

   ##### 

  

 

that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the
Proxy Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of
Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.
Parent agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Proxy
Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company
or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment
or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. 

   

 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ (a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other representatives and advisors reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, directors, officers and employees but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or violate applicable Law, and during such period the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request (including the work papers of the Companys current and prior auditors). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be required to), to the extent permitted by applicable Law, following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records and such other information concerning the Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No investigation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives and no other receipt of information by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision of this Agreement, or the obligations of the Parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold, any and all information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (b) Subject to applicable law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an orderly transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consultation and Notice._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, 

   ##### 

  

 

each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its commercially reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental
Entities and other persons and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other
registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental
Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any
supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity, including
participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its
review of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or third party and (v) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from any third party; _provided_ , that none
of the Company, Parent or Sub shall be required to make any payment to any
such third party or concede anything of value to obtain such
consents, approvals or waivers. In connection with and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors
shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions necessary
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent will use its reasonable efforts to litigate or participate
in the litigation of any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity to
accomplish the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article
VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not without the prior written consent of
Parent, agree or proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any
licensing, business restriction or similar arrangement with respect to, any
assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any portion of any business of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. The Company and
Parent shall provide such assistance, information and cooperation to each
other as is reasonably required to obtain any such actions, nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations and, in connection
therewith, shall notify the other person promptly following the receipt of
any comments from any Governmental Entity and of any request by any
Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or additional information in
respect of any registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, such
Governmental Entity. 

   

 (b) The Company and Parent shall promptly advise the other Party orally and in writing of (i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Sub) contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or Section 6.03(a), as the case may be, could not be 

   ##### 

  

 

satisfied or (ii) the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, of Sub) to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (and, in the case of Parent,
of Sub) under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or obligations of the Parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
promptly provide the other with copies of all filings made by such Party with
any Governmental Entity, all correspondence or other communications sent by
such Party to any Governmental Entity and all notices or other communications
sent to such Party from any Governmental Entity, in each case, in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the
portions of such filings, correspondence, notices or other communications, as
applicable, that include confidential information not directly related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such claim, it being understood and agreed that this Section 5.03(c) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense. 

  

 (d) Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the Parties, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, will adopt this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 5.04. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and set forth in Section 5.04 of the Company Letter shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for at least six years following the Effective Time in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Surviving Corporation does not have the resources to honor the foregoing obligations, Parent shall honor such obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable rights of indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation contemplated by this Section 5.04(a) and pursuant to the terms of any certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect at or prior to the Effective Time shall not be impaired by any modification of such terms in any amendment or restatement of any such certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) following the Effective Time (including in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Merger). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.04. 

  

 (c) The Company shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, at Parents expense, as of the Effective Time a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall, prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six-year period; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay or shall the Company be permitted to expend, with respect to the entire six-year period following the Effective Time, premiums for insurance under this Section 5.04(c) which in the aggregate exceed 200% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the period from February 2010 to, and including, February 2011, for such purpose (which premiums for such period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $479,738);  _provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect to the entire six-year period following the Effective Time, as may be obtained for such 200% amount. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.04(c) shall require Parent to make expenditures exceeding $959,476 in the aggregate. If requested by Parent, the Company shall issue a broker of record letter naming the insurance broker selected by Parent to effect such runoff coverage, and the Company shall provide all cooperation and information reasonably requested by Parent and the selected insurance broker with respect to the procurement of such runoff coverage. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.04 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

 SECTION 5.05. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.05, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) In the event that (i) (1) a Takeover Proposal has been privately made (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to the Company after the date hereof (excluding solely for the purpose of this clause (1), a Takeover Proposal that is limited to an inquiry and does not constitute or lead to an offer or proposal) or (2) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly made or otherwise becomes publicly disclosed 

   ##### 

  

 

(whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to the Company or
the stockholders of the Company or any person has publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a
Takeover Proposal, and, in any such case, thereafter (A) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the
Stockholders Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof has not been
held by the date that is five business days prior to the date of such
termination) or either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii)
and (B) prior to the date that is 12 months after such termination, (x)
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement
with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (y) any Takeover Proposal is
consummated (solely for purposes of this Section 5.05(b)(i)(B), the term "
_Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of
Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except that all references to
20% shall be deemed references to 50%), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by
the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), then, in any such case, the Company
shall pay Parent a fee equal to $103,700,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by
wire transfer of same-day funds (A) in the case of a termination by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), concurrently with such termination, (B)
in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within
two business days after such termination and (C) in the case of a payment as
a result of any event referred to in Section 5.05(b)(i)(B), no later than the
first to occur of the events referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above, in each
case to an account designated by Parent. 

   

 (c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events. 

  

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.05 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 5.05 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 5.05, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.05 at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

  

 SECTION 5.06. _Public Announcements._ The Parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the Parties. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to Section 4.02 or Section 7.01, Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and 

   ##### 

  

 

shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such reasonably practicable consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. 

   

 SECTION 5.07. _Resignation of Subsidiary Directors._ At the Closing, if requested by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of any or all the directors of any Subsidiary of the Company, effective at the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 5.08. _Sub Compliance._ Parent shall cause Sub to comply with all of Subs obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 5.09. _Company Employees._ (a) From the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide Company and its Subsidiaries employees who remain employed by the Company or a Subsidiary after the Closing (each, a " _Transferred Employee_ ") with reasonably comparable compensation (excluding any equity-based compensation) and benefits in the aggregate as those provided immediately prior to the Closing or those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its affiliates. Except (i) as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.09(a), (ii) for the purposes of any equity-based compensation and (iii) for the purposes of any "service awards", each Transferred Employee shall be entitled to credit for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not benefit accrual purposes) under each of Parents Plans for all periods of service for which such Transferred Employee was granted credit under a similar plan in which such Transferred Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of determining the severance, if any, entitlements of each Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date, Parent will take into account all service accrued by such Transferred Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that the amount of severance entitlement in Korea shall be reduced by the severance benefit accrued by such Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date for service prior to the Closing Date that is required to be paid by applicable Law. With respect to any Parents Plan under which a Transferred Employee is entitled to medical, dental, hospitalization or other health insurance in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent will grant each Transferred Employee credit for all co-payments and deductibles paid by such Transferred Employee in such year under a similar plan of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company. Parent will ensure that such Parents Plans maintained in the United States will not impose any preexisting condition limitation under any medical, dental, health or other similar welfare plan in which Transferred Employees are entitled to participate that would exclude coverage under such plan for any claim of a Transferred Employee for which coverage would have been provided under the corresponding plan of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company. With respect to Parents Plans maintained outside the United States, preexisting condition limitations will be determined in accordance with applicable Law. For purposes of this Section 5.09(a), the term " _Parent s Plan_" means an employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or its affiliates in which a Transferred Employee is or becomes eligible to participate following the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

 

The Company agrees to provide Parent with the information reasonably required
by Parent to meet its obligations under this Section 5.09(a). The provisions
of this Section 5.09(a) are for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and
nothing in this Section 5.09(a), express or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to (A) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation
and benefit plans, programs or arrangements maintained for or provided to
Transferred Employees or any other employees of Parent prior to, on or
following the Effective Time, or of the Company or Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time, or impose an obligation on any of the Company or Parent or
their affiliates to establish, continue, amend, terminate or otherwise take
any action with respect to, or a prohibition from amending, suspending or
terminating, any compensation or benefits plan, program or arrangement or (B)
confer upon or give to any person, other than the Parties hereto, any legal
or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 5.09(a)). 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all of the actions set forth on Section 5.09(b) of the Company Letter.

 (f) by the Company, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of Section 4.02(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(f), and any purported termination pursuant 

   #####

If any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by PDF, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf the signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or PDF signature were an original thereof. 

  

 SECTION 8.06. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement (a) together with the Exhibits hereto and the Company Letter, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, and (b) except for the provisions of Section 5.04, is not intended to confer upon any person other than the Parties (and their respective

remedies, whether as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise. 

   

 SECTION 8.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof.

Each of the Parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such persons respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

  

 SECTION 8.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AND ANY OTHER TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR OTHER ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; 

  

 (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER AND THAT IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND 

  

 (C) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.10. 

  

 SECTION 8.11. _Enforcement._ The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the posting of any bond, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, any Party may contemporaneously commence an action for specific performance and seek any other form of remedy at Law or in equity that may be available for breaches under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages). 

  

 SECTION 8.12. _Consents and Approvals._ For any matter under this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any Party to be valid and binding on the Parties, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and delivered to the other Parties by a person duly authorized by such Party to do so. 

  

 SECTION 8.13. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
