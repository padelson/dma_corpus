purposes of any &#147;service awards&#148;, each Transferred Employee shall be entitled to credit for
eligibility and vesting purposes (but not benefit accrual purposes) under each of Parent&#146;s Plans

plan in which such Transferred Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the

Employee as of the Closing Date, Parent will take into account all service accrued by such
Transferred Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date; <U>provided</U> that the amount of severance entitlement in Korea shall be reduced

Parent&#146;s Plan under which a Transferred Employee is entitled to medical, dental, hospitalization or
other health insurance in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Parent will grant each Transferred Employee credit for all co-payments and
deductibles paid by such Transferred Employee in such year under a similar plan of the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company. Parent will ensure that such Parent&#146;s Plans maintained in the United
States will not impose any preexisting condition limitation under any medical, dental, health or
other similar welfare plan in which Transferred Employees are entitled to participate that would
exclude coverage under such plan for any claim of a Transferred Employee for which coverage would
have been provided under the corresponding plan of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.
With respect to Parent&#146;s Plans maintained outside the United States, preexisting condition
limitations will be determined in accordance with applicable Law. For purposes of this Section
5.09(a), the term &#147;<U>Parent&#146;s Plan</U>&#148; means an employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or its affiliates in which a Transferred Employee is or becomes eligible to

the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the posting of any bond, to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in any
Delaware State court or the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity. For the avoidance of doubt, any Party may contemporaneously commence an action for
specific performance and seek any other form of remedy at Law or in equity that may be available
for breaches under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages).

any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision hereof and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
