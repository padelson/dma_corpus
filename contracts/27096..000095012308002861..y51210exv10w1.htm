 (b) Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and its Affiliates with the provisions of the bulk transfer and bulk sales Laws of any applicable jurisdictions; _provided_ , _that_ , that Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and each of their respective successors and assigns from and against any and all losses of any such Persons, directly or indirectly, as a result of, or based upon or arising from the failure to comply with any such Laws; and _provided_ , _however_ that nothing in this Agreement will prevent either party from asserting as a bar or defense in any action or proceeding brought under any bulk sales or bulk transfer Law that such Law does not apply to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

Section 2.8 _Non-Assignability of Assets_  

   

 To the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer of any Purchased Asset or Assumed Agreement is prohibited by any Law or would require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers (" _Consent_ ") and such Consent shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof. For a period (the " _Transfer Period_ ") beginning on the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the Non-Compete Expiration Date) and ending on the earlier of (a) one year from such date or (b) Seller consummates a Seller Change of Control (provided, however, that the Transfer Period shall not, in any case, be less than six months), Seller agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or satisfy, at the earliest practicable date, all Consents to facilitate the full and expeditious transfer of legal title, or Sellers or its Selling Subsidiaries rights, as the case may be, to the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration therefor, nor shall Seller have any obligation to extend or renew any such Assumed Agreement that may expire during such period. If the necessary Consent is obtained, Seller shall assign and transfer any such Purchased Asset or Assumed Agreement to Buyer at no additional cost, and Buyer shall thereupon assume all obligations and liabilities of Seller under any such Assumed Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the necessary Consent is not obtained within such period, Sellers obligations to Buyer with respect to such Purchased Asset or Assumed Agreement shall expire, Seller shall be free to terminate any such Assumed Agreement in accordance with its terms, and under no circumstances shall the Purchase Price be reduced on account of the failure to obtain any such Consent. If any such Consents are not obtained and/or satisfied by the time of the Closing and Buyer in its sole discretion waives such requirement, then, at Sellers expense: (a) 

   ##### 

  

    

Seller shall continue to use such commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
same, (b) Seller shall at the Closing enter into such arrangements as Buyer
may reasonably request in order to provide to Buyer the benefit of any the
non-transferred items, until such items have been transferred to Buyer (or
its Affiliate, as applicable), if ever, whether by assignment, novation or
otherwise and (c) Buyer shall perform such non-transferred items as
subcontractor to Seller (to the extent subcontracting is permissible under the
relevant item) or, where subcontracting is not permissible, as agent for
Seller, until such items have been transferred to Buyer (or its Affiliate, as
applicable), if ever, whether by assignment, novation or otherwise. Nothing
herein shall be construed as an attempt to transfer any Contract,
Permit, Approval or other Purchased Asset which by its terms requires Consent
to do so unless such Consent has been obtained. Buyer shall grant Seller a
license to any and all Purchased Assets to the extent the same are necessary
for Seller to continue to perform its obligations under any such Assumed
Agreement. 

  

Section 2.9 _Delivery by Seller_  

   

 At the Closing, Seller will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer the following (unless delivered previously): 

  

 (a) stock certificates and stock powers with respect to the Artema Stock duly executed to Buyer, free and clear of any Liens; 

  

 (b) the Secretarys Certificate referred to in Section 5.1(c) hereof; and 

  

 (c) duly executed counterparts of the Transaction Documents. 

  

Section 2.10 _Delivery by Buyer_  

   

 At the Closing, Buyer will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller (or one or more of Sellers Affiliates, as designated by Seller) the following (unless previously delivered): 

  

 (a) the Base Purchase Price less the Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency or plus the Estimated Net Working Capital Excess, as the case may be, by transfer of immediately available funds (to such account as Seller may direct by written notice delivered to Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date); 

  

 (b) the Secretarys Certificate referred to in Section 5.2(c) hereof; and 

  

 (c) duly executed counterparts of the Transaction Documents. 

  

Section 2.11 _Net Working Capital Adjustments; Accounts Receivable
Adjustments_  

   

 (a) _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a good faith estimate of the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "). The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than 

   ##### 

  

    

$49,132,000 (the " _Target Closing Date Net Working Capital_ ") is the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency_ " and the amount, if any, by which
the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Closing
Date Net Working Capital is the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Excess_."
Seller shall make available to Buyer all work papers and other books and
records utilized in calculating the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital. 

  

 (b) _Post-Closing Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of its final determination of the Patient Monitoring Business actual (rather than estimated) Closing Date Net Working Capital (sometimes referred to herein as the " _Buyer s Report_"), which determination shall set forth in reasonable detail Buyers calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital. The Buyers Report shall also set forth, and explain in reasonable detail, any differences between Buyers calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital and Sellers Calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital. The Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Standards. A copy of all work papers and other books and records utilized in the preparation of the Buyers Report shall be made available to Seller at such time. Seller will notify Buyer in writing (the " _Net Working Capital Dispute Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days after receiving the Buyers Report if Seller disagrees with the Buyers calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital as set forth in the Buyers Report, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and Sellers calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital. If no Net Working Capital Dispute Notice is received by Buyer within such thirty (30) day period, the Buyers calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital as set forth in the Buyers Report shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. Seller and Buyer will give each other and their respective representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to the personnel, books and records of the Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, relating to the Closing Date Net Working Capital to assist Buyer in the preparation of the Buyers Report and to assist Seller in the preparation of any Net Working Capital Dispute Notice. 

  

 (c) Upon receipt by Buyer of a Net Working Capital Dispute Notice, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement with respect to the Closing Date Net Working Capital set forth in the Net Working Capital Dispute Notice. To the extent Buyer and Seller are unable to agree with respect to the Closing Date Net Working Capital within thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of the Net Working Capital Dispute Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Buyer and Seller shall promptly but not later than five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the Resolution Period submit the issues as to the proper amount of the Closing Date Net Working Capital for a binding determination to any internationally recognized accounting firm that is not an affiliate of, or engaged as the accounting firm for, any of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates (an " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") that is mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer, or, if no such agreement is reached within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the Resolution Period, each of Seller and Buyer shall select an Independent Accounting Firm, whereupon such Independent Accounting Firms shall jointly select a third Independent Accounting Firm. Such accounting firm selected by Seller and Buyer, or by the two 

   ##### 

  

    

Independent Accounting Firms, as the case may be, may consider only items
disputed by the Net Working Capital Dispute Notice and matters affected
thereby, and its determination of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital
(as defined below) shall not be less than the Closing Date Net Working
Capital set forth in the Buyers Report or more than the Closing Date Net
Working Capital set forth in the Net Working Capital Dispute Notice. Such
accounting firms determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after
their selection, shall be set forth in a written statement as to the dispute
and the resulting computation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
delivered to Buyer and Seller, shall be final, binding and conclusive and
shall constitute an arbitral award upon which a judgment may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. The amount of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital as agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, as deemed agreed upon
pursuant to the next-to-last sentence of _Section 2.11(b)_ or as determined
by such accounting firm in accordance herewith, shall be the " _Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital_." The fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be paid by the party (either Seller or Buyer) whose latest offer or
position as to an acceptable amount for the Closing Date Net Working Capital
at the time the issue is submitted to such accounting firm is furthest away
from the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital as determined by such
accounting firm. 

  

 (d) If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, the amount equal to the difference between the two (the " _Final Net Working Capital Deficiency_ ") shall be paid by Seller to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days after the amount of the Final Net Working Capital Deficiency has been determined. If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is more than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, the amount equal to the difference between the two (the " _Final Net Working Capital Excess_ ") shall be paid by Buyer to Seller within ten (10) Business Days after the amount of the Final Net Working Capital Excess has been determined. 

  

 (e) The amount of Final Net Working Capital Deficiency or Final Net Working Capital Excess, if any, paid pursuant to _Section 2.11(d)_, shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 (f) The following terms shall have meanings set forth below: 

   

 (i) " _Current Assets_ " shall mean, as of a specified date, all of the current assets of the Patient Monitoring Business (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Inventory), other than Excluded Assets (which Excluded Assets shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, Accounts Receivable), as determined in accordance with GAAP; 

   

 (ii) " _Current Liabilities_ " shall mean, as of a specified date, all of the current liabilities of the Patient Monitoring Business, other than Excluded Liabilities, as determined in accordance with GAAP; and 

   

 (iii) " _Closing Date Net Working Capital_ " shall mean, as of the closing of business on the Closing Date, (a) the Current Assets minus (b) the Current 

   ##### 

  

    

Liabilities, all as determined for the Patient Monitoring Business as of the
closing of business on the Closing Date and in accordance with GAAP.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER  

  

 Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Purchased Assets are sold "as is, where is" and Buyer agrees to accept the Purchased Assets in the condition they are in at the place they are located on the Closing Date based on its own inspection, examination and determination with respect to all matters, and without reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any nature made by, on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except for such representations and warranties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Each of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries is qualified to do business or licensed and, where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

have a Material Adverse Effect.

 Attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ are true, complete and correct copies of the Financial Statements. The Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) fairly present in all material respects (a) the assets and liabilities of the Patient Monitoring Business as of December 31, 2007 (the " _Interim Balance Sheet Date_ ") and June 30, 2007 and (b) the revenues and expenses of the Patient Monitoring Business for the six-month period ended December 31, 2007 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006.

ARTICLE VII 

   

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS  

  

Section 7.1 _Employee Matters_  

   

 (a) Effective as of the Closing, the employees listed on the Agreed List of Employees shall become employees of Buyer on terms of employment in accordance with Section 7.1(b) below. All such employees who become employed by Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries effective as of the Closing or thereafter are hereinafter referred to as the " _Transferred Employees_." Employment with Buyer of Transferred Employees shall commence immediately on the Closing Date, except that employment of individuals on leave of absence or short-term disability leave, maternity leave, salary continuation and extension type of leave, military leave or workers compensation (" _Leave Employees_ "), except as otherwise provided by Law, shall become 

   ##### 

  

 

effective as of the date they first present themselves for active work with
the Buyer; provided, however, that Buyer, except to the extent otherwise
required by Law, shall have no obligation to hire Leave Employees unless
such individuals first present themselves for active work with Buyer within
six (6) months following the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, Leave
Employees who accept an offer of employment from Buyer shall be deemed to be
Transferred Employees as of the date they accept employment with Buyer. 

   

 (b) For the period ending on December 31st of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year that includes the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Transferred Employee, compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits provided to Transferred Employees immediately before the Closing (excluding any retiree welfare benefits, compensation or benefits provided pursuant to equity-based awards or any defined benefit plans and any payments or benefits that would become payable upon a change of control of Seller). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (A) Buyer shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide the Transferred Employees whose employment with Buyer terminates during the Continuation Period with severance benefits that are at least equal to levels of base salary provided as severance under Sellers broad-based severance policy as such policy is in effect immediately prior to the Closing (to the extent that the benefits under such policy as of the Closing Date are not more generous than the benefits provided thereunder as of the date of this Agreement), as set forth on _Schedule 7.1(b)_ and (B) during such Continuation Period, severance benefits offered by Buyer to the Transferred Employees shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the Closing in base salary paid to the Transferred Employees. The Buyer Savings Plan described in Section 7.1(e) shall be a savings-type defined contribution plan intended to be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and shall accept rollover contributions and provide a loan feature. 

  

 (c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, benefit accrual and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Transferred Employees established during the Continuation Period (the " _New Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Seller before the Closing, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. All such periods of employment have been provided to Buyer, specified by employee, prior to the Closing Date. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is analogous to a Seller Benefit Plan or Seller Foreign Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the analogous plan of Seller or the 

   ##### 

  

 

Selling Subsidiaries in which such Transferred Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents under
the Seller Benefit Plan or Seller Foreign Plan to be taken into account under
the corresponding New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Plan. 

   

 (d) Buyer and Seller agree to use the "alternate procedure" specified in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 for reporting the wages of the Transferred Employees and the payment of FICA taxes with respect to the Transferred Employees. As soon as administratively feasible following the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer the information required for reporting wages on Form W-2 for each Transferred Employee for the year in which the Closing Date occurs. 

  

 (e) As soon as reasonably practical following the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish a defined contribution plan (or cover Transferred Employees under an existing defined contribution plan sponsored by Buyer) (the " _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") for the benefit of Transferred Employees who, as of the Closing Date, are participants in the Amended and Restated Datascope Corp. 401(k) Savings and Supplemental Retirement Plan of Seller (the " _Savings Plan_ "). Seller shall fully vest all Transferred Employees in their account balances under the Savings Plan and all other retirement plans of Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries (as set forth on _Schedule 7.1(e)_ ) intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code as of the Closing Date. As soon as practical following the Closing Date (the " _Transfer Date_ "), in accordance with Code Section 414(1), Seller shall cause the trustee of the Savings Plan to transfer directly to the Buyer Savings Plan to transfer the full account balances of each of the Transferred Employees who is a participant under the Savings Plan valued as of the valuation date under the Savings Plan coincident with the Transfer Date or the Business Day immediately preceding the Transfer Date. The value of the account balance of each Transferred Employee will be transferred in cash and marketable securities (or such other form as may be agreed by Buyer and Seller) to the Buyers Savings Plan, except that the value of any outstanding participant loans, which any such Transferred Employee has as of the Transfer Date will be transferred in kind. Notwithstanding that the Closing will occur prior to the Transfer Date, the Savings Plan will not default any outstanding loan of any Transferred Employee, whose account balance under the Savings Plan will be transferred to the Buyer Savings Plan pursuant to this Section 7.1(e). In no event, however, shall such transfer take place until the furnishing to Buyer by Seller of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the qualification of the Savings Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code on which Seller is entitled to rely as of the Transfer Date. 

  

 (f) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, to the extent permitted by Law, with Buyers attempts to obtain information relating to the Transferred Employees employment with the Patient Monitoring Business, excluding making available to Buyer such employees personnel files and performance evaluations (all of which files and evaluations shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

transferred as of the Closing). To the extent permitted by Law, Seller and
Buyer shall provide each other with access to information necessary in order
to carry out the provisions of this Section 7.1, including,
without limitation, making available all information regarding base wages,
compensation and bonus and benefit entitlements of the individuals on the
Agreed List of Employees during their employment with Seller as of the date
of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) Seller shall retain liability for all earned but untaken vacation and/or paid time off credited to each Transferred Employee by Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. 

  

 (h) Nothing in this Section 7.1 or any other provision of this Agreement (i) shall be construed to modify, amend or, except as is otherwise provided in Section 7.1(b) with respect to Buyers 401(k) plan, establish any benefit plan, program, or arrangement or in any way limit, and Seller and Selling Subsidiaries shall take no action after the date hereof that would limit, the ability of the parties hereto or any other Person to modify, amend, or terminate any of the Seller Benefit Plans, Seller Foreign Plans or New Plans as may be allowed under the terms of such plans or applicable Law or (ii) confers or is intended to confer upon any Transferred Employee (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) any rights, including any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment, compensation or benefits. 

  

Section 7.2 _Books and Records; Access_  

   

 (a) Seller agrees to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer as soon as practicable after the Closing, copies of all material books, records and other documents of Seller or its Affiliates to the extent related to the Patient Monitoring Business and the Purchased Assets as Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ that any portions thereof that do not relate to the Patient Monitoring Business or the Purchased Assets may be redacted from the copies delivered to Buyer. From and after the Closing, Seller will permit Buyer and its duly authorized representatives access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all Contracts, books, records and other data of Seller or its Affiliates to the extent relating to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities conveyed and assumed at the Closing (to the extent that such Contracts, books, records and data were not previously delivered to Buyer); _provided_ that any portions thereof that do not relate to the Patient Monitoring Business or the Purchased Assets may be redacted from the copies to which such access is permitted. In addition, Seller agrees that, from and after the Closing, Buyer or its authorized representatives may, at Buyers cost and expense, make copies of Sellers or its Affiliates books and records (or redacted portions thereof) to the extent related to the Patient Monitoring Business, including the pricing information of the Products, to the extent that such books and records were not delivered to Buyer. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing Date and for a period of seven (7) years, in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns (including Tax Returns relating to the calendar year in which the Closing occurs) or in connection with any Tax, regulatory or accounting investigation, inquiry or review or any pending or threatened third party action or injury that is related to the 

   ##### 

  

 

ownership of the Purchased Assets or the operation of the Patient Monitoring
Business prior to the Closing, upon reasonable prior notice, and except as
determined in good faith to be appropriate to ensure compliance with any
applicable Laws and subject to any applicable privileges (including
the attorney-client privilege) and contractual confidentiality obligations,
the Buyer shall, and shall cause Artema and its representatives to, (i)
afford Seller and its Affiliates reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the offices, properties, books and records of the Buyer and
Artema in respect of Artema, the Patient Monitoring Business, the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) furnish to Seller and its Affiliates
such additional financial and other information regarding Artema, the Patient
Monitoring Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as
Seller may from time to time reasonably request and (iii) make available to
Seller and its Affiliates the employees of Buyer and Artema in respect of
Artema, the Patient Monitoring Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities whose assistance, expertise, testimony, notes and recollections
or presence is necessary to assist Seller in connection with
Sellers inquiries for any of the purposes referred to above, including, at
Sellers sole cost, the presence of such persons as witnesses in hearings or
trials for such purposes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such investigation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates; and _provided_ _further_ , that the external auditors
and accountants of Buyer or its Affiliates shall not be obligated to make
any work papers and data available to any Person unless and until such Person
has signed a customary confidentiality agreement relating to such access to
work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or
accountants. Seller shall be obligated to pay for Buyers costs in satisfying
any of its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.2(b). 

   

 (c) The rights under this Section 7.2 to receive, copy or have access to Contracts, books, records, Tax Returns, work schedules and other documents and data shall survive until the later to occur of the expiration of the statute of limitations for the imposition of Tax with respect to the years to which such Contracts, books, records, documents and data pertain, or seven (7) years from the year to which such Contracts, books, records, documents and data pertain, _provided_ that such access or copying shall not unduly interfere with the business and affairs of the party or applicable Affiliate(s) permitting such access or copying. Neither party shall be obligated hereunder to disclose to the other party any information the disclosure of which would violate any Law. 

  

Section 7.3 _Insurance_  

   

 As of the Closing Date the coverage under all insurance policies related to the Patient Monitoring Business shall continue in force only for the benefit of Seller and its Affiliates, and not for the benefit of Buyer or its Affiliates. As of the Closing Date Buyer agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities covering all periods and agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies which may provide coverage for claims relating in any way to the Patient Monitoring Business. 

   ##### 

  

  

Section 7.4 _Payments from Third Parties_  

   

 In the event that, on or after the Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments or other funds due to the other pursuant to the terms hereof or otherwise, then the party receiving such funds shall promptly forward such funds to the proper party. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no right of offset regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received from third parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a dispute regarding any other issue under this Agreement. 

  

Section 7.5 _Further Assurances_  

   

 (a) Each of Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all conditions to its and the other parties obligations hereunder to be timely satisfied and to perform and fulfill all obligations on its part to be performed and fulfilled under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, to the end that the transactions contemplated herein shall be effected substantially in accordance with its terms as soon as reasonably practicable.

 (b) Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts, and instruct its employees, auditors or other authorized representatives to use reasonable efforts, to cooperate with requests to furnish to Buyer, auditors or other authorized representatives of Buyer financial information regarding the Patient Monitoring Business as such persons may reasonably request for the purposes of Buyers preparation of standalone historical financial statements in respect of the Patient Monitoring Business. 

  

 (c) At any time from the Effective Date through the Transfer Period, upon the request of Buyer, the parties shall meet to discuss in good faith any concerns over the completeness of the lists of patent applications included in the schedule of Transferred Patent Rights. If the parties determine that any unpublished patent application owned by Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date exclusively relates to the Patient Monitoring Business (as determined based on the independent claims of such application) and has been omitted from such schedule, the parties shall amend such schedule to include such omitted unpublished patent applications. If the parties determine that any unpublished patent application owned by Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date primarily relates to the Patient Monitoring Business (as determined based on the independent claims of such application) and has been omitted from such schedule, the parties shall work together in good faith to put in place appropriate arrangements between the parties relating to such unpublished patent applications, including licenses thereto.

 (d) All cash collected on or after the Closing Date with respect to Accounts Receivable which constitute Excluded Assets shall belong to, and if received by Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates, shall be received for the benefit and the account of, Seller, and Buyer shall (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to), on a weekly basis, transfer and remit to Seller all such amounts received by or paid to Buyer and/or any of their Affiliates. By way of clarification, to the extent Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates receives cash from a distributor which has accounts receivables owing to Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates and Accounts Receivable owing to Seller, such cash (to the extent of the outstanding Accounts Receivable from such distributor) shall be received for the benefit and the account of, Seller, and Buyer shall (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to), on a weekly basis, transfer and remit to Seller all such amounts. 

  

Section 7.6 _Tax Matters_  

   

 (a) Seller shall timely file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns (other than Income Tax Returns) related to the Purchased Assets (solely for purposes of this Section 7.6 and except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6(b), the term "Purchased Assets" shall exclude the Artema Stock) and all Tax Returns of Artema required to be filed by Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries, or Artema on or before the Closing Date (after taking into account any extensions) and shall pay all Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns. Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be filed, (i) all Tax Returns related to the Purchased Assets (other than Income Tax Returns) and (ii) all Tax Returns of Artema for the taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on, before or including the Closing Date which have not been filed prior to or on the Closing Date and Buyer shall remit to the proper taxing authority all Taxes shown due thereon. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall not have the right to file any amended Tax Return with regard to the Purchased Assets or Artema for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period) without Sellers consent. Seller shall have the right to file any amended Tax Returns with regard to the Purchased Assets or Artema with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period). Either party shall have the right to file an amended Tax Return with regard to the Purchased Assets with respect to any Straddle Period, provided that in the event that any such filing proposed by one party would affect the obligations of the other party under this Agreement, then the party proposing to amend such Tax Return shall obtain the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 7.6, Seller shall not have the right to file any amended Tax Return with regard to the Purchased Assets (including, for this purpose, Artema Stock) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period if such amendment is reasonably likely to result in increased Taxes to Buyer, unless Buyer consents. 

  

 (c) With respect to Tax refunds: 

   

 (i) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds or credits (including interest paid therewith) received in respect of any Tax liability (x) of Artema or (y) with regard to the Purchased Assets, in each case in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period;  _provided_ that Seller shall not be entitled to any such refund or credit 

   ##### 

  

   

(including interest paid therewith) to the extent such refund or credit was
taken into account in determining the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital or any adjustment thereto under Section 2.11 hereto or otherwise to
the extent Buyer actually pays the Tax for which such refund or credit is
owed. 

   

 (ii) Except as provided in Section 7.6(c)(i), Buyer shall be entitled to any refunds (including interest paid therewith) in respect of any Tax liability of Artema or with regard to the Purchased Assets. 

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Taxing Authority subsequently disallows any item or refund with respect to which a party has received payment from the other party pursuant to this Section 7.6(c), such recipient party shall promptly pay (or cause to be paid) to the other party the full amount of such item or refund (including any interest paid therewith). 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, income, deductions, and other items in respect of a Straddle Period shall be calculated by treating the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, and the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the taxable period that is so deemed to end on and include the Closing Date shall be allocated based on an actual closing of the books of the relevant entity as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in closing books, Taxes (such as Property Taxes) that are not imposed on income, receipts, or otherwise on a transactional basis and exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated on a daily basis. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Seller, prior to the Closing Date, from making, or causing to be made, an election under Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-3 with respect to Artema. 

  

 (f) Buyer shall not make, or cause to be made, an election under Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-3 with respect to Artema that goes into effect, and as to which the transactions described in Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-3(g) occur, on or prior to the Closing Date without the consent of Seller. 

  

 (g) With the consent of Seller, which consent may be granted or withheld by Seller in its sole discretion, Buyer shall not make, nor allow any Affiliate to make, the election permitted to be made under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to Artema (the " _Artema 338 Election_ "). However, if requested by Seller, Buyer shall, at Sellers expense, make the Artema 338 Election. If the Artema 338 Election is made, Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller of the filing of such election, which notice shall contain the information required by Treasury Regulations section 1.338-2(e)(4), and shall be furnished in the time and manner set forth therein. 

  

 (h) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Affiliate to, during the period from the Closing until December 31, 2008, cause Artema to (i) enter into a transaction which would directly or indirectly result, for United States federal income tax purposes, in a dividend 

   ##### 

  

 

distribution to Buyer or its Affiliates or an inclusion to income to Seller
for U.S. tax purposes or (ii) engage in any activity or transaction which
could be considered out of the ordinary course of business for Artema for the
calendar year that includes the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer agrees that
it shall promptly provide Seller with any information reasonably requested by
Seller related to the foreign tax credits claimed by, or available to, Seller
(or the affiliated group of which Seller is the parent). If Buyer, in
accordance with Section 7.6(g), makes the Artema 338 Election, then Buyers
obligations in the first sentence of this Section 7.6(h) shall be null and
void. 

   

Section 7.7 _Covenant Not to Compete_  

   

 (a) Seller agrees that for a period (such period, the " _Non-Compete Expiration Date_ ") between the Closing Date and the earliest to occur of (i) the third anniversary of the Closing Date; (ii) the first anniversary of the date of a Buyer Change of Control; and (iii) the first anniversary of the date of a Seller Change of Control, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, manage, operate, control, engage or acquire any ownership interest in any firm, corporation, partnership, proprietorship or other business entity that engages in a business in competition with Buyer with respect to the Base PM Business, as the Base PM Business has been conducted during the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of this Agreement, on a worldwide basis (each a " _Seller Competing Business_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that it shall not be a violation of this Section 7.7(a) for Seller or any of its Affiliates (i) to own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person that are traded on a national securities exchange (or a securities exchange outside the U.S.) if Seller or any of its Affiliates (A) is not a controlling Person or a member of a group that controls such Person and (B) does not, directly or indirectly, own more than 5% of the voting securities of such Person, (ii) to directly or indirectly acquire any Person that includes a Seller Competing Business that, at the time of such acquisition, constituted less than 20% of the assets or revenue of such Person, _provided_ that Seller disposes of such Seller Competing Business within twelve (12) months after the closing date of such acquisition (regardless of whether such twelve (12) month period extends beyond the Non-Compete Expiration Date) or (iii) provide services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. Also, in the event that from the period between the Closing Date until the Non-Compete Expiration Date, Seller completes a business combination transaction with a Person that is engaged in any Seller Competing Business, which transaction results in such Person beneficially owning more than 50% of the voting power of the voting securities of Seller outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction (a " _Seller Change of Control_ "), such Person and its Affiliates (other than Seller (or the surviving entity of Seller or successor in interest of Seller or its assets) and its Subsidiaries) shall not be subject to the restrictions in this Section 7.7(a) and Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be subject to the restrictions in Section 7.7(b). For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.7(a) shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from operating, and it shall not be a violation of this Section 7.7(a) for Seller or any of its Affiliates to operate, the Non-PM Business. 

   

 (b) Buyer agrees that until the Non-Compete Expiration Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, manage, operate, control, engage or acquire any ownership interest in any firm, corporation, partnership, proprietorship or other business entity 

   ##### 

  

  

that engages in a business in competition with Seller with respect to the Non-
PM Business, as the Non-PM Business has been conducted during the twelve (12)
month period preceding the date of this Agreement, on a worldwide basis (each
a " _Buyer Competing Business_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that it shall
not be a violation of this Section 7.7(b) for Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(i) to own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any
Person that are traded on a national securities exchange (or a securities
exchange outside the U.S.) if Buyer or any of its Affiliates (A) is not a
controlling Person or a member of a group that controls such Person and (B)
does not, directly or indirectly, own more than 5% of the voting securities
of such Person, (ii) to directly or indirectly acquire any Person that
includes a Buyer Competing Business that, at the time of such acquisition,
constituted less than 20% of the assets or revenue of such Person, _provided_
that Buyer disposes of such Buyer Competing Business within twelve (12)
months after the closing date of such acquisition (regardless of whether such
twelve (12) month period extends beyond the Non-Compete Expiration Date) or
(iii) provide services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, or use
the marks subject of, and pursuant to, the Trademark License Agreement. Also,
in the event that from the period between the Closing Date until the Non-
Compete Expiration Date, Buyer completes a business combination transaction
with a Person that is engaged in any Buyer Competing Business, which
transaction results in such Person beneficially owning more than 50% of the
voting power of the voting securities of Buyer outstanding immediately prior
to the consummation of such transaction (a " _Buyer Change of Control_ "),
such Person and its Affiliates (other than Buyer (or the surviving entity of
Buyer or successor in interest of Buyer or its assets) and its Subsidiaries)
shall not be subject to the restrictions in this Section 7.7(b) and Seller
and its Affiliates shall not be subject to the restrictions in Section
7.7(a). For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.7(b) shall
prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from operating, and it shall not be a
violation of this Section 7.7(b) for Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
operate the Patient Monitoring Business. 

  

Section 7.8 _Non-Solicitation_  

   

 (a) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Buyer will not, and will cause all of its Subsidiaries and its and such Subsidiaries respective officers and directors not to, and shall not authorize or permit its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, hire, retain, employ or solicit to employ or hire or retain any of the employees of Seller and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date or any time during the twelve (12) month period ending on the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not apply to (i) general solicitations of employment not specifically directed towards employees of Seller and its Affiliates or (ii) any such individual whose employment relationship is terminated by Seller or any of its Affiliates following the Closing. 

  

 (b) Except with respect to the individuals set forth on _Schedule 7.8_, for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Seller will not, and will cause all of its Subsidiaries and its and such Subsidiaries respective officers and directors not to, and shall not authorize or permit its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, hire, retain, employ or solicit to employ or hire or retain any of the employees of Buyer and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date (including, 

   ##### 

  

 

for this purpose, the persons on the Agreed List of Employees) or any time
during the twelve (12) month period ending on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this provision shall not apply to (i) general solicitations
of employment not specifically directed towards employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates or (ii) any such individual whose employment relationship
is terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates following the Closing. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 

   

TERMINATION  

  

Section 8.1 _Termination or Abandonment_  

   

 This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time: 

  

 (a) by either Seller (by action duly authorized by the Board of Directors of Seller, or an authorized committee thereof) or Buyer (by action of the Board of Directors of Buyer, or an authorized committee thereof) if there has been a breach or failure to perform by the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) in the case of a breach or failure to perform by Seller, would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.1, and (2) in the case of a breach or failure to perform by Buyer, would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.2 (and in each case such breach is not reasonably capable of being cured or such condition is not reasonably capable of being satisfied within seven (7) Business Days after the receipt of notice thereof by the defaulting party from the non-defaulting party, it being understood and agreed that this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)(i) during, or following, such period of seven (7) Business Days if such breach is cured during such period);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement is not available to the non-breaching party if the other party is at that time in material breach of this Agreement; 

  

 (b) by either Buyer or Seller, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued a final, non-appealable order, decree or ruling in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby; 

  

 (c) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller duly authorized by the Board of Directors of Seller and the Board of Directors of Buyer, or authorized committee thereof; or 

  

 (d) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30, 2008, unless the failure to consummate such Closing is the result of a wilful and material breach of any Transaction Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that the passage of such period shall be tolled for any part thereof during which any party shall be subject to a non-final order, decree, ruling or action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of such Closing. 

   ##### 

  

  

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_  

   

 In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms and Sections 8.2, 9.11, 9.12, 9.13 and 9.14 shall also survive such termination, provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to the date of such termination. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any breach or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. 

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

MISCELLANEOUS  

  

Section 9.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_  

   

 None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing, other than the representations and warranties in (a) Sections 3.2(a), 3.19, 4.2, and 4.8, which shall survive indefinitely. 

  

Section 9.2 _Schedule Updates_ 

   

 Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement, amend or create any Schedule corresponding to the representations and warranties contained in Article III in order to add information or correct previously supplied information. No such supplemental, amended or additional Schedule shall be deemed to cure any breaches of a representation or warranty on or prior to the Closing; however, if the Closing occurs, such supplement, amendment or addition will be effective to cure and correct for all purposes any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed if Seller had not made such supplement, amendment or addition, and all references to any Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended as provided in this Section 9.2 shall for all purposes include such added information or corrected information. Buyer and Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, agree in accordance with Section 9.3 to supplement or amend any Schedule corresponding to the definitions contained in Article I or the covenants or agreements. 

  

Section 9.3 _Amendments; Waivers_  

   

 At any time prior to the Termination Date, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Seller, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the 

    ##### 

  

    

waiver is to be effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay
by Buyer or Seller in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. 

  

Section 9.4 _Assignment; Binding Effect_  

   

 Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part, its rights, interest and obligations under this Agreement to one or more direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder to the extent any such subsidiary does not satisfy its obligations hereunder. 

  

Section 9.5 _Severability_  

   

 Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon any such determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.
