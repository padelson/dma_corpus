as provided in _Section 11.16_ and (iii) pay to the Paying Agent an amount
in cash equal to the product of (x) the Closing Per Share Cash Consideration
multiplied by (y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which amount shall be held by the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the Holders to make the payments contemplated
by this _Section 2.6(a)_ to each Holder of Common Stock (following
such Holders delivery of a duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_), of an amount
in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock held by each
such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, _times_ (y) the Closing
Per Share Cash Consideration. Such payments are to be made by check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions
specified by Escrow Agent, the Stakeholder Representative and Paying Agent,
respectively, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. From
and after the Effective Time, holders of Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company, except as provided herein or by Law.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and no transfer of shares of Common Stock shall thereafter be made.

 

(b) _Other Payments_. In addition to the payments required to be made pursuant
to _Section 2.6(a)_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay at the
direction of and on behalf of the Company in accordance with the terms hereof,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to payment
instructions provided by the Company, (i) the Indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies listed in _Section 2.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, as
indicated in payoff letters from the holders thereof, (ii) the Unpaid
Transaction Expenses for which the Company has delivered to Parent an
invoice and payment instructions, and (iii) all Award Payments.

 



-17- (c) _Procedures for Payment_. The Paying Agent shall effect the exchange of
cash for certificates which, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of Common Stock entitled to payment pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_ (the "Certificates"). Within ten (10) Business Days following
the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to each Stockholder a letter of
transmittal, in the form and substance substantially similar to _Exhibit E_
attached hereto (the "Letter of Transmittal") and instructions for use
in surrendering certificates to the Paying Agent (or otherwise complying with
the final sentence of this _Section 2.6(c)_ ) in exchange for the Closing Per
Share Cash Consideration as specified in _Section 2.2(a)_, in each case with
such changes thereto as are required by the Paying Agent, and the information
required by Section 262 of the DGCL in a form that is reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company. At or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
each Stockholder who has not already delivered such documents prior to the
Effective Time, shall surrender to the Paying Agent Certificates representing
the shares of Common Stock held by such Stockholder at the Effective Time, and
each Stockholder shall deliver to the Paying Agent a Letter of Transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
therein and any other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions. The Paying Agent shall promptly provide a copy of the Letter of
Transmittal, and deliver the Certificates and any stock powers, to Parent.
Promptly following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y)
delivery by a Stockholder of its Certificates and executed Letter of
Transmittal to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such
Stockholder the payment to which such Stockholder is entitled under _Section
2.2(a)_ (and calculated as provided in _Section 2.6(a)_) to the Stockholder
as indicated in such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent solely the right to receive
the payment to which such Stockholder is entitled under _Section
2.2(a)_ (and calculated as provided _Section 2.6(a)_), without interest, and
such Stockholders Pro Rata Share of any Distributions (except for such
Distributions not made in accordance with a Stockholders Pro Rata Share as a
result of differential values of Subaccounts as contemplated by _Section
9.6_(a)), and neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
required to pay the holder thereof the cash to which it would otherwise have
been entitled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of
such fact by the Stockholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the providing of an indemnity by such Stockholder to the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such
Certificate in customary form and amount, the Paying Agent shall issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the payment
contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)_, without interest.

 

(d) _Return of Funds_. Any portion of the amounts deposited with the Paying
Agent that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, upon
request by Parent, be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent
shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the payment to
Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent will be liable to any Person with respect to any cash delivered to a
public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any amounts payable in accordance with this _Article II_
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such amounts, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior
to the date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, will become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



-18- Section 2.7 _Adjustment of Pre-Closing Estimates._

 

(a) _Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_. No later than sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be
delivered, to the Stakeholder Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Purchase Price Measurement
Time (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"), prepared by the Company in
good faith in accordance with the Accounting Methodology and (ii) a reasonably
detailed calculation by the Company of (x) the Net Working Capital (the
"Preliminary Net Working Capital"), (y) the Closing Net Indebtedness (the
"Preliminary Closing Net Indebtedness") and (z) the Unpaid Transaction
Expenses (the "Preliminary Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount"), in each case
as of the Purchase Price Measurement Time (the "Preliminary Closing
Statement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Companys
calculation of the Net Working Capital contemplated by clause (i) above is
greater than the Maximum Net Working Capital, the Preliminary Closing
Statement shall reflect that the Preliminary Net Working Capital shall be
deemed to be the Maximum Net Working Capital.

 

(b) _Review by the Stakeholder Representative_. The Stakeholder Representative
shall have forty-five (45) days following receipt of the Preliminary Closing
Statement to review the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the amounts
shown in the Preliminary Closing Statement and to notify the Company in
writing if it disputes the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet or any of
the calculations shown in the Preliminary Closing Statement (a "Dispute
Notice"), specifying the items and amounts in dispute and the reasons therefor
in reasonable detail and the values that it believes in good faith to be
correct. Only such items included in the Dispute Notice as originally
delivered or any items that result therefrom may be disputed by the
Stakeholder Representative. In connection with the Stakeholder
Representatives review and any disputes pursuant to  _Section 2.7(c)_, the
Stakeholder Representative and its representatives shall have reasonable
access to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents
prepared by the Company or its representatives related to or in connection
with its preparation of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the
Companys calculation of the amounts shown in the Preliminary Closing
Statement and to finance personnel of the Acquired Companies and any other
information which the Stakeholder Representative reasonably requests, and the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the
Stakeholder Representative and its representatives in connection therewith.

 

(c) _Dispute Notice_. In the event the Stakeholder Representative does not
timely deliver a Dispute Notice within forty-five (45) days following receipt
of the Preliminary Closing Statement, then the Preliminary Closing Net
Indebtedness, the Preliminary Net Working Capital and the Preliminary Unpaid
Transaction Expense Amount shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Net
Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Unpaid Transaction
Expenses, respectively. In the event that the Stakeholder Representative
timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Company, the Company and the
Stakeholder Representative 

 



-19-  shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as
practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the amounts shown in the Preliminary
Closing Statement shall be made in accordance with the agreement of the
Company and the Stakeholder Representative. If the Company and the Stakeholder
Representative are unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days
(or such longer period as the Company and the Stakeholder Representative shall
mutually agree in writing) of the Companys Receipt of such Dispute Notice,
the remaining items in such dispute shall promptly thereafter be submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, and the resolution of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts as to
which the Company and the Stakeholder Representative have disagreed within
the time periods and on the terms specified above. In making such
determination, the Independent Accounting Firm may rely upon information
submitted to it by the Company or the Stakeholder Representative and other
information available to the Independent Account Firm. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver to the Company and the Stakeholder Representative a written
report setting forth the resolution of each disputed matter within thirty
(30) days of submission of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the
Preliminary Closing Statement to it and, in any case, as promptly as
practicable after such submission. The determination made by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall not exceed or be less than the amounts proposed by the
Company and the Stakeholder Representative, as applicable. The Independent
Accounting Firm will determine the allocation of the cost of its review and
report based on the inverse of the percentage its determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. (For example,
should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Independent
Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Stakeholder Representatives
position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of its review would be borne by the
Company and forty percent (40%) of the costs would be borne by the
Stakeholder Representative). The Stakeholder Representative and the Company
shall pay the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm as so
allocated.

 

(d) _Final Determination_. After final determination of the Net Working
Capital (the "Final Net Working Capital"), the Closing Net Indebtedness (the
"Final Closing Net Indebtedness") and the Unpaid Transaction Expenses (the
"Final Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount"), whether because no Dispute Notice
is timely delivered by the Stakeholder Representative or because any disputes
are resolved as provided in _Section 2.7(b)_ and _Section 2.7(c)_, the
parties shall determine the Final Adjustment Amount as follows; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the actual final determination of the Final Net
Working Capital, the parties agree that the maximum amount of the Final Net
Working Capital Amount for purposes of this _Section 2.7_ or for purposes of
determining the Final Adjustment Amount shall be the Maximum Net Working
Capital.

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount is negative, then the
Stakeholder Representative and Parent shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the final determination thereof, issue joint written instructions
directing the Escrow Agent to pay an amount equal to the absolute value of the
Final Adjustment Amount out of the Escrow Account by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent (unless Parent
shall have elected to seek payment directly from the Holders as Direct
Recourse Damages as provided in _Section 9.6_). 

 



-20- (ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is positive, then Parent shall, within
five (5) Business Days after the final determination thereof, pay (x) a
portion of the Final Adjustment Amount to the Paying Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Paying Agent, for
distribution to each stockholder its Pro Rata Share of the Final Adjustment
Amount (subject to the withholding of Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.10_) and
(y) the remainder of the Final Adjustment Amount to the Company for
distribution to each Holder of Vested Options its Pro Rata Share of the Final
Adjustment Amount (subject to the withholding of Taxes pursuant to Section
2.10).

 

(iii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is zero, then no payments shall be made
with respect thereto.

 

Section 2.8 _The Escrow Account._

 

(a) _Escrow Contribution; Subaccounts_. Pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_, Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited the Escrow Amount into the Escrow
Account, in cash. Within the Escrow Account, Parent and the Stakeholder
Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to create a notional subaccount
for each Holder (which shall initially be an amount in cash equal to
such Holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount ) (collectively, the
"Subaccounts") and will make any corresponding changes to the Escrow Account
with respect thereto, and if the Escrow Agent shall be unable to create
such Subaccounts, Parent and the Stakeholder Representative shall keep
records of any such Subaccounts as provided in _Section 9.6_ and may jointly
direct the Paying Agent and Escrow Agent to make distributions as reflected by
such records. The parties agree that Parent shall be treated as the owner of
the Escrow Account for all federal and state income Tax purposes.

(b) The Escrow Fund (i) shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement; and (ii)
shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes set forth in, and in
accordance with the terms of, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) The Stakeholder Representative and Parent shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make any
distributions from the Escrow Account expressly provided for herein. In
connection with any such joint written instructions, if the distributions
shall not be paid on the basis of a Pro Rata Share from all Subaccounts, the
Stakeholder Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
from which Subaccounts payments are to be made.

 

(d) _Payments from the Escrow Account_. Upon the receipt of any payment out of
the Escrow Account designated for payment to the Holders, the Paying Agent
shall pay to each Holder such Holders Pro Rata Share of such payment except
for such distributions not made in accordance with a Holders Pro Rata Share
as a result of differential values of Subaccounts as contemplated by 
_Section 9.6_(a) (subject to the withholding of Taxes pursuant to _Section
2.10_). Any payments so made to the Holders out of the Escrow Account shall be
treated as an increase to the Merger Consideration.

 



-21- Section 2.9 _Dissenting Shares._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and unless
otherwise provided by the DGCL, shares of Company Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by
Stockholders who have properly perfected their appraisal rights in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such
Stockholders will have failed to perfect or will have effectively withdrawn or
lost their right of payment under the DGCL. Such Stockholders, who have so
perfected their appraisal rights, will instead be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL. If any such
Stockholder will have failed to perfect or will have effectively withdrawn or
lost such appraisal rights, each share of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to
receive and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration specified and allocated in  _Section 2.2(a)_ and subject to
the terms thereof.

(b) Each party hereto shall give each other party hereto prompt notice of any
demands received by it for appraisal of shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other related instruments received by it. Parent shall
have the right, to the extent reasonably practicable, to receive notice of
and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands and the exercise of such appraisal rights under the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Stakeholder Representative shall have the right to direct
all such negotiations and proceedings. Except with the prior written consent
of (1) the Stakeholder Representative, no other party hereto shall make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands and
(2) Parent, no other party hereto shall make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands unless such payment or settlement
includes an express unconditional release of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates from all liabilities
and obligations relating to such demand and the exercise of such appraisal
rights under the DGCL and such payment or settlement does not impose
injunctive or other equitable relief against Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each party hereto may make such payments
and take such actions as are required by applicable Law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of
any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would have
been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or
(ii) incurs any other costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding or in
connection with any investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares
(together "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be entitled to recover
under the terms of _Article IX_ the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments
without regard to the Basket or the Minimum Claim Basket.

 



-22- Section 2.10 _Withholding._

 

Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Tax law.
Amounts withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ and paid over to the
appropriate Tax authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

antitrust, competition or similar Law ("Foreign Antitrust Merger Control
Laws"), (c) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of

Companys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 3.5 _Capital Structure._

tangible and intangible personal property owned or leased by an Acquired
Company that is reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or acquired since the date of such balance
sheet, in each case free and clear of Encumbrances except for Permitted
Encumbrances, except (a) for such tangible personal property that has been
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since such date or (b) where
the failure to have good and valid title or leasehold interest, respectively,

have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in _Section 3.10_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter and except as relates to Intellectual Property, the
property and assets (both tangible and intangible) of the Acquired Companies,

requirements. The Company and ICG Group shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve and keep all material books and records of or relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the period prior to the Closing

anything herein to the contrary, no such access shall be permitted to the
extent that it (x) would require any party to disclose information subject

damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event
of a breach or a threatened breach by Parent of any such obligations, ICG
Group shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be

party, (x) would cause significant competitive harm to the any of the
disclosing party if the transactions contemplated by hereby are not

Companies (or their respective predecessors)

 



-49-  (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees"), as provided in (i) the
Organizational Documents of any of the Acquired Companies in effect on the
date of this Agreement, or (ii) any agreement providing for indemnification
by any Acquired Company of any of the Company Indemnitees in effect on the
date of this Agreement and listed on _Section 7.6_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (an "Indemnity Agreement"), shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and continue in full force and
effect on equal or more favorable terms (including, at the option of Parent,
in new indemnity agreements), and be honored by Parent and the Acquired
Companies after the Closing.

(b) _D andO Insurance_. Effective immediately after the Closing, Parent shall,
for the benefit of the Companys directors and officers covered by the
officers and directors liability insurance policies held by or for the
benefit of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Current
Policies"), cause coverage to be extended under the Current Policies by
obtaining, at Parents sole expense, a "tail" policy (the "Tail Policy") from
an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at least "A" under the Current
Policies, which (i) has an effective term of six years from the Closing, (ii)
covers each Person currently covered by the Current Policies for actions and
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing and (iii) contains terms that
are no less favorable than those of the Current Policies. From and after the
Closing, Parent shall cause the Tail Policy to remain in full force and effect
and for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Date shall not cause
or permit any of its Affiliates to amend, waive, modify or otherwise alter the
terms thereunder unless such amendment, repeal or modification is required by
applicable Law; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for any such Tail Policy aggregate total
premiums in excess of 300% of the aggregate cost of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for the Current Policies.

 

(c) _Obligation of Successor_. In the event that the Company or Parent or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges

case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor, assign or acquirer
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

 

(d) _Intended Third Party Beneficiaries_. From and after the Effective Time,
the obligations of Parent under this _Section 7.6_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitees to

affected Company Indemnitees who are current officers or directors of an
Acquired Company as of the Effective Time (it being expressly agreed that the
Company Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.6_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_).

 

(e) _ICG Group Indemnification_. The parties agree that directors, officers or
employees of ICG Group who are or were directors, officers or employees of
any of the Acquired Companies shall only be entitled to seek recovery from the
Company or the Surviving Corporation after the Closing under the Tail Policy
in accordance with its terms and 

 



-50-  that if any such director, officer or employee seeks indemnification
directly against Parent or any Acquired Company (whether as contemplated by
this Section 7.6 or otherwise), then ICG Group shall reimburse Parent or any
Acquired Company for any costs, expenses or liabilities incurred in connection
therewith.

 

Section 7.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts._

 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, and without limiting the obligations of
the parties under _Section 7.5_ (but subject to limitations therein), each of
the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist
and cooperate with the other party hereto in doing all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
but not limited to: (i) the satisfaction (but not the waiver) of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto; (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary and applicable consents, waivers or approvals of
any third parties (including Governmental Entities); (iii) the defending of
any Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the performance of the obligations hereunder; (iv) the submission of joint
instructions, from time to time as necessary for the release of any monies due
to any party to this Agreement from the Escrow Fund (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement), (v) the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the
taking of such other actions as the other party hereto may reasonably require
in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Company or the Holders or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be obligated to make any payments or otherwise pay any
consideration to any third party to obtain any applicable consent, waiver or
approval. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly take all
actions reasonably requested by Parent prior to the Closing to perfect the
transfer to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries of legal and beneficial
title to those interests in its Subsidiaries not held by one of the Acquired
Companies as set forth in  _Section 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter by
the Closing and take all actions reasonably requested by Parent prior to the
Closing to bring any Subsidiary of the Company that is not in good standing
(or its local law equivalent) or is otherwise not in compliance with local
law requirements as to corporate, tax and foreign investment registrations as
set forth in _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter into good
standing (or its local law equivalent) and compliance with such local law
requirements.

Section 7.8 _Tax Matters._

 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

(i) For all taxable periods of a U.S. Acquired Company ending on or including
the Closing Date, ICG Group shall cause such Acquired Company to join in the
ICG Consolidated Group income Tax Returns (each, an "ICG Group Return"). For
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods where a U.S. Acquired Company is included in an
ICG Group Return, the Company shall, on a timely basis, prepare, or cause to
be prepared, pro forma Tax Returns for each such U.S. Acquired Company on a
standalone basis, including a calculation of Taxes owed on a standalone basis
(each, a "Pro Forma Tax Return"),

 



-51-  in accordance with the past practice of the Acquired Companies unless
otherwise required by Law, and ICG Group shall timely file, or cause to be
filed (taking into account available extensions), all ICG Group Returns for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and shall pay or cause to be paid to the relevant
Tax authority any Taxes shown to be due thereon. The Company shall engage
Grant Thornton LLP (or such other Tax Return preparer as the parties mutually
agree) to prepare such Pro Forma Tax Returns. ICG Group shall file all
relevant ICG Group Returns in a manner consistent with the Pro Forma Tax
Returns and applicable Law. With respect to ICG Group Returns that include a
U.S. Acquired Company, Parent or the Acquired Company shall pay to ICG Group
any Taxes shown as due on Pro Forma Tax Returns, to the extent such Taxes were
included as a Current Liability on the Preliminary Closing Statement in the
Companys actual calculation of Preliminary Net Working Capital (without
giving effect to whether the Preliminary Net Working Capital exceeds the
Maximum Net Working Capital) as finally adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.7(b)
and 2.7(c) at least five (5) Business Days before payment of such Taxes is
due and any amount of Taxes shown as due that are in excess of such amount
shall be paid by the Holders to ICG Group at least five (5) Business Days
before payment of such Taxes is due. In the case of any ICG Group Return in
which a U.S. Acquired Company is required to be included relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period that is first required to be filed after the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver each such Pro Forma Tax Return to ICG Group
and Parent no later than July 30 of the year following the taxable year for
which such Pro Forma Tax Return is being prepared (or as reasonably promptly
thereafter, consistent with past practice) and ICG Group and Parent shall
review such Pro Forma Tax Returns and each such party shall consider any
reasonable comments to such Pro Forma Tax Returns proposed by the other two
parties in good faith. Any expenses incurred by Parent or any Acquired Company
in connection with preparing any Tax Return pursuant to this _Section
7.8(a)_ shall be borne solely by the Stakeholder Representative (on behalf of
the Holders).

 

(ii) Parent and the Acquired Companies shall prepare and file (or shall cause
to be prepared and filed) all other Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for
taxable periods that end on or include the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return,
including Tax Returns for a Straddle Period, prepared (or caused to be
prepared) by Parent or an Acquired Company shall be submitted to Stakeholder
Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (taking into
account available extensions) of such Tax Return for its review and comment,
and Parent and the Acquired Companies shall accept any reasonable
comments thereto made by the Stakeholder Representative with respect to any
item for which the Holders have responsibility under _Section 9.10_. The
portion of the Taxes shown to be due on any Tax Return for a Straddle Period
that is attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the Taxes due on any other Tax Return prepared
pursuant to this _Section 7.8(a)(ii)_ ending on or before the Closing Date
less, in both cases, the amount of such Taxes that were included as a Current
Liability on the Preliminary Closing Statement in the Companys actual
calculation of Preliminary Net Working Capital (without giving effect to
whether the Preliminary Net Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Net Working
Capital) as finally adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.7(b) and 2.7(c) shall be
paid by the Holders to Parent in each case, at least five (5) Business Days
before payment of such Taxes is due.

 



-52- (b) _Post-Closing Matters_. Unless otherwise required by Law, without the
prior written consent of the Stakeholder Representative (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any Acquired Company, to (i) amend any Tax Return with respect to
any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii) make, revoke or
change any Tax election, or change any method of accounting, in each case with
respect to any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(c) _Tax Refunds_. If any Acquired Company receives any Tax refund relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than any Tax refund that is accounted for
in the determination of Current Assets (whether in the form of cash received
from the applicable Governmental Entity or a direct credit against Taxes
otherwise payable for any Pre-Closing Tax Period), Parent shall promptly, and
in any event within five (5) Business Days of receipt thereof, pay, or cause
to be paid, to the Stakeholder Representative (as agent for, on behalf of, and
for payment to, the Holders), the amount of such Tax refund. If such Tax
refund relates to a Straddle Period, such refund shall be apportioned between
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement governing such periods. Upon the receipt of
any such payment, the Stakeholder Representative shall pay to each Holder
such Holders Pro Rata Share of such payment, and any payments so made shall
be treated as an increase to the Merger Consideration. To the extent permitted
by Law without penalty to or reduction in the aggregate available amount
thereof, the Acquired Companies shall elect to forego a carryback of any net
operating losses, capital losses, credits or other Tax attributes (including
the election under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code) from any Post-Closing Tax
Period to any Pre- Closing Tax Period. If and to the extent that an Acquired
Company is not permitted by applicable Law to forego such a carryback without
penalty to or reduction in the aggregate available amount thereof,
the Acquired Companies shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes with respect
thereto and ICG Group or the Stakeholder Representative shall promptly, and in
any event within five (5) Business Days of receipt thereof, pay, or cause to
be paid, to Parent (as agent for the Acquired Companies), the amount of such
Tax refund.

(d) _Reporting_.

 

(i) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the parties hereto agree
to report (or cause to be reported) (A) all transactions occurring at or
before the Closing (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the payment of any Transaction Expenses) on the U.S. federal (and, if
applicable, state and local) Tax Return of the ICG Consolidated Group for the
Tax period that includes the Closing Date; and (B) all transactions outside
the ordinary course of business of the Acquired Companies occurring on the
Closing Date after the Closing on the U.S. federal (and, if applicable,
state and local) Tax Return of the Parent Consolidated Group.

(ii) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the parties hereto
further agree to close the Tax year of the Company as of the end of the day on
the Closing Date (including, if required by Law, by making an applicable Tax
election) for U.S. state and local Tax purposes, if applicable.

 



-53- (iii) If any member of the ICG Consolidated Group transfers a loss share
(as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(f)) of
the Company in connection with the Merger in the taxable year that includes
the Closing Date, then the ICG Consolidated Group shall make an election
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) in the manner
prescribed by 1.1502-36(e)(5)(viii).

(iv) In the event that the ICG Consolidated Group has experienced an
"ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder during the period beginning on the date when
the Company became a member of the ICG Consolidated Group and ending on the
Closing Date, ICG Group shall make or cause to be made an election pursuant to
Section 1.1502-95(c) of the Treasury Regulations to apportion to the Company
and its Subsidiaries a proportionate amount of "consolidated Section 382
limitation" and "consolidated net unrealized built in gain" (as defined in the
applicable Treasury Regulations).

 

(v) ICG Group shall make or cause to be made promptly, but in no event later
than thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement, any filing that
may be required under the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on
Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Non-resident
Enterprises Equity Transfer Income (Circular 698) promulgated by the
Peoples Republic of China in connection with the actions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) _Reserved._

 

(f) _Assistance and Cooperation_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
_Section 7.4(b)_), following the Closing Date, the Stakeholder
Representative, and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to), to the extent
reasonably requested in writing by the other party:

a. make available to the other party or parties all information in
its possession relating to any of the Acquired Companies which is relevant in
the preparation and filing of any Tax Return (including any Pro Forma Tax
Return) for any Tax period;

 

b. cooperate fully in responding to any inquiry from, or any dispute with, any
Governmental Entity and in the preparation for or defense of any Third Party
Claim relating to Taxes, in each case relating to any of the Acquired
Companies; and

 



-54- c. timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file
Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes.

 

(ii) _Section 9.3_ shall apply to any Third Party Claim for Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_  that (A) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall provide notice of any such Third Party Claim to the
Stakeholder Representative regardless of whether Parent or the Surviving
Corporation intends to seek indemnity pursuant to _Article IX_  with respect
to such Third Party Claim; and (B) neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be permitted to settle or
compromise any such Third Party Claim that could result in an increase in
Taxes (or reduction in Tax attributes) (x) of the Acquired Companies for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or (y) of the ICG Consolidated Group, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Stakeholder Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the
case of any Third Party Claim with respect to Taxes that is controlled by the
Stakeholder Representative or another member of the ICG Consolidated Group
(other than any Acquired Company), such Person (A) shall, as it determines to
be reasonable, prosecute such Third Party Claim in good faith, (B) shall keep
the Parent reasonably informed of the status of developments with respect to
such Third Party Claim and (C) shall not settle or concede any such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of Parent if such settlement or
concession could result in a material increase in Taxes (or reduction in Tax
attributes of Parent or the Acquired Companies) for any Post-Closing Tax
Period.

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by the Holders (in accordance with each Holders Pro Rata Share) and
fifty percent (50%) by Parent.

 

Section 7.9 _Resignations._

 

The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written
resignations of each director or officer of an Acquired Company in their
capacity as a director or officer of such Company that is reasonably requested
by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, effective
as of and conditioned upon the Closing.

 

Section 7.10 _Notice of Certain Events._

 

Until the Closing, the Company, ICG Group and Parent promptly shall notify
each other in writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance or
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware that will or is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ becoming incapable of being satisfied; _provided_ that (a) any
failure to give notice under _Section 7.10_ shall not (i) be considered for
purposes of determining the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth
in _Article VIII_ or (ii) give rise to a right of termination under
_Article X_ and (b) Parent shall not seek indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2(b)(ii) asserting a breach of the covenant set forth in this _Section
7.10_ as a Direct Recourse Damage absent Willful Misconduct. No disclosure by
the Company or ICG Group pursuant to this _Section 7.10_, however, shall be
deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



-55- Section 7.11 _Employees._

 

(a) During the one-year period following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates (including, as applicable, the Acquired
Companies) to: (i) provide each of the employees of the Acquired Companies who
continue in employment with the Acquired Companies immediately following the
Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee") with base salary or base wages,
short-term incentive opportunities for commissions or bonuses (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding equity-based compensation and severance) that
are substantially similar in the aggregate as provided to such Continuing
Employee under the Company Plans set forth on _Section 3.17(a)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) provide
benefits to the Continuing Employees that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to such Continuing Employees under the
Company Plans set forth on _Section 3.17(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter as in effect on the Closing Date.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall (or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to) provide the Continuing Employees with service credit for
purposes of: (i) eligibility and vesting under any Plan in which such
Continuing Employees participate that is maintained, sponsored, contributed to
or required to be contributed to or entered into by Parent or any of its
Affiliates for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or
other service provider of Parent or any of its Affiliates (each, a "Parent
Plan"); and (ii) the level of benefits provided under any Parent Plan in which
such Continuing Employees participate that is a vacation, paid-time off or
severance plan, for all periods of employment with the Acquired Companies and
their predecessors prior to the Closing Date to the same extent to which such
service was recognized by the Acquired Companies under any equivalent Company
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however that no such
service shall be credited to the extent that it would result in a duplication
of benefits or would not be credited to other similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Affiliates; provided, further, that no such service shall be
credited with respect to retiree insurance or retiree medical premium credit.
Parent shall ensure that any Parent Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees
(or their eligible dependents) coverage on the basis of a pre-existing
condition, actively-at-work requirement or required physical examination, to
the extent allowable under the terms of the Parent Plan and applicable Law
(and except to the extent that such conditions or requirements would apply
under the Company Plans in which the Continuing Employees participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date). Nothing contained herein shall require
Parent or shall cause the Parent Plans to credit Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) for any deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
expenses paid in the year of initial participation prior to the Closing Date
for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum
out-of-pocket expenses under any applicable Parent Plan with respect to the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 

(c) The Acquired Companies shall (or shall cause the applicable Plan sponsor
to), at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, (i) cease
contributions to, and adopt written resolutions (or take other necessary or
appropriate action) to terminate the Procurian USA, Inc. 401(k) Plan and any
other Company Plan that is intended to qualify under 

 



-56-  Section 401(a) of the Code with a cash or deferred arrangement described in
Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the "401(k) Plans") in compliance
with its terms and the requirements of applicable Law, and (ii) one hundred
percent (100%) vest all participants under the 401(k) Plans, such termination
and vesting to be effective no later than the Business Day preceding the
Closing Date. The Parent and its Affiliates reserve the right to suspend the
distribution of benefits from the 401(k) Plans in accordance with applicable
Law until the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to the termination of such 401(k) Plans.

(d) All provisions contained in this _Section 7.11_ with respect to employee
benefit plans or employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of
the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right in any other
Person, including any employee or former employee of the Acquired Companies or
any participant or beneficiary in any Company Plan. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 7.11_ shall
(i) be deemed to be the adoption of, or an amendment or modification to, any
Plan, including the Company Plans, or otherwise limit the right of the
Acquired Companies, Parent or their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any such Plan or obligate Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Acquired
Companies to maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement, or (ii)
give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section
7.11_ including the right to continued employment or a specific term or
condition of employment.

Company Stockholder Consent, hereby waives any right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DCGL with respect to its shares of Common Stock as a result
of the Merger.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof (and in any event
prior to the Closing Date), ICG Group (i) shall cause ICG Holdings to exercise
its drag-along right in accordance with the terms of Section 7 of the
Stockholders Agreement and relevant sections of the Additional Drag-Along
Agreements; (ii) shall cause the Company to mail within five (5) Business Days
following the date hereof, via each Stockholders address of record, a notice,
a written consent for Parents benefit and instructions to Stockholders
subject to the "drag along" provisions in the Stockholders Agreement or the
Additional Drag-Along

 



-57-  Agreements in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and (iii) deliver to
Parent a copy of all executed consents received by ICG Group or any of its
Subsidiaries. Upon delivery of any written consent contemplated by clause

it permit any of its Subsidiaries and any of its respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, subsidiaries or other agents to take, any action to
solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other
than Parent, Merger Subsidiary and/or their respective Affiliates) concerning
any direct or indirect purchase of any of the Companys equity securities or
any merger, sale of substantial assets or similar transaction involving any
Acquired Company or ICG Group (for the avoidance of doubt other than the sale
by any Acquired Company of immaterial assets in the ordinary course of
business) (each such acquisition transaction, an "Acquisition Transaction").
The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any proposal regarding an
Acquisition Transaction and the terms and conditions of any such proposal and
the identity of the Person making any such proposal and shall keep Parent
informed on a current basis in all material respects of the status and details
of any such proposal.

 

(b) Each of ICG Group and the Company agrees not to release or permit the
release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision
of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar
Contract to which any such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
under which any such party or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights, and
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such agreement to
be enforced at the request of the other party to this Agreement.

and the Company and their Subsidiaries shall, and they shall cause their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and Merger Subsidiary and
their respective Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. As
soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall (i) promptly request each Person that has executed a
confidentiality agreement prior to the date hereof in connection with its
consideration of an Acquisition Transaction to return or destroy, in each
case pursuant to the terms of such confidentiality agreement, all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and (ii) terminate the access of any Persons other than

of its Subsidiaries or Representatives relating to any Acquisition
Transaction.

The Company and ICG Group will terminate or cause to be terminated (a) on or

of the Company Disclosure Letter and (b) as of the day prior to the Closing
Date, any Tax sharing or similar agreement between any Acquired Company and
any other party (the "Tax Sharing Agreements") any and all powers of attorney
relating to Tax matters of any Acquired Company (the Contracts referred to in
(a) and (b), the "Terminated Contracts"). Following the termination of the
Terminated Contracts in accordance with this  _Section 7.15_, no such
Contract shall have further force or effect for any past or future taxable
period.

 

Section 7.16 _Intercompany Balances._

 

Prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies, the Stakeholder
Representative and ICG Group shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, close out, settle, pay or cancel all intercompany accounts or balances
(whether or not documented by a note or loan agreement) between an Acquired
Company, on the one hand, and ICG Group or any Subsidiary of ICG Group (other
than an Acquired Company), on the other hand. No later than ten (10) days
following the date hereof, the Company shall submit to Parent for its review
and approval its proposed plan with respect to the closing out, settlement,
payment or cancellation of such accounts and shall accept any reasonable
comments made by Parent with respect thereto. The Holders shall bear all
costs, expenses, liabilities and Taxes associated with the actions
contemplated by this _Section 7.16_.

 

Section 7.17 _Non-Solicit_

 

(a) For a period of two years commencing on the Closing Date (the "Restricted
Period"), ICG Group shall not, and shall not permit any of its controlled
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or encourage any such
employee to leave such employment or hire any such employee who has left
such employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not
directed specifically to any such employees; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 7.17(a)_ shall prevent ICG Group or any of its controlled Affiliates
from hiring (i) any employee whose employment has been terminated by
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) after 180 days from the
date of termination of employment, any employee whose employment has been
terminated by the employee or (iii) any employee who responds to a general or
public solicitation not targeted at Surviving Corporations or its
Subsidiaries employees or such person (including by a bona fide search firm
or pursuant to an online advertisement). 

(b) ICG Group acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this _Section
7.17_ would give rise to irreparable harm to Surviving Corporation, for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in
the event of a breach or a

 



-59-  threatened breach by ICG Group of any such obligations, Surviving
Corporation shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that
may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific
performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of
competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

 

(c) ICG Group acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
7.17_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Surviving Corporation and constitute a material inducement to Parent to enter
into this Agreement and consummate the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any covenant contained
in this _Section 7.17_ should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time,
geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable
Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to reform such
covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to
the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this _Section 7.17_
and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and
provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the
remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 7.18 _Further Assurances._

 

From time to time at or after the Closing Date, at the request of the other,
Parent, the Company and ICG Group each will execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, such other instruments of conveyance, assignment,
transfer and delivery and take such actions as the other parties reasonably
may request in order to consummate, complete and carry out the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.19 _ICG Post-Closing Cooperation._

 

From and after the Closing, at the reasonable request of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, ICG Group shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to
provide the type of necessary assistance (other than administrative services)
that was provided by ICG Group to the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing
Date at a price equal to the cost of such services, including an allocation
for the cost of internal time, incurred by ICG Group and on such other terms
as determined by Parent and ICG Group in good faith. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this _Section 7.19_, ICG Group shall not be
required to obtain any additional resources not possessed by ICG Group
including hiring new employees and purchasing new equipment, in order to
perform any such services.

require performance prior to the Closing, which shall expire at the Closing.
The representations and warranties made by any of the parties hereto under
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Article VIII_
shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ that the Company Fundamental Reps and the ICG Group Fundamental
Reps shall survive the Closing indefinitely (as applicable, the
"Indemnification Period"). No action or claim for Warranty Losses resulting
from any misrepresentation or breach of warranty shall be brought or made
after the Indemnification Period applicable to such representation or
warranty; _provided_ that any indemnity claim (but solely such claim)
described in a Claim Notice received by the Responsible Party prior to the
expiration of the applicable Indemnification Period shall survive until such
claim is fully resolved.

Section 9.2 _Claims._

 

(a) _Indemnification of Parent_. From and after the Closing, the Holders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and Parents Affiliates, including
the Surviving Corporation, and their respective directors, officers, employees
and Affiliates (collectively, the "Parent Indemnitees") from any Damages
suffered or paid, directly or indirectly, as a result or arising out of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or misrepresentation or breach of any representation
or warranty made as of the date hereof or deemed made as of the Closing by

(iii) any Dissenting Share Payments;

 



-63- (iv) any claim or action by Persons who are or were holders of any securities
of the Company, in their capacities as such, arising out of facts or

arising out of the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); or

(v) any claim as provided in _Section 9.10_.

Any such obligation of a Holder shall be for his, her or its Pro Rata Share of
the amount of any Damages that may be collected hereunder, which shall be
collected from the Escrow Account and, solely for Direct Recourse Damages,
from the Holder in accordance with _Section 9.6_; provided that in no event
shall any Holder be liable pursuant to this _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than (x)
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(v)_, (y) in the case of fraud or Willful
Misconduct or (z) as arising under _Section 11.12_) for Damages in excess of
the sum of (x) the aggregate Closing Cash Per Share Consideration, (y) the
aggregate amount of Distributions and (z) the aggregate Award Payments, in
each case, that such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. 

(b) _Indemnification by Parent_. From and after the Closing, Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Holders and their Affiliates, and their
respective directors, partners (limited and general), members, managers,
officers, stockholders, employees, agents and representatives (the "Holder
Indemnitees") harmless from any Damages suffered or paid, directly or
indirectly, as a result or arising out of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty made as of the date hereof or deemed made as of the Closing by Parent
or Merger Subsidiary in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement (including the certificate delivered pursuant to  _Section
8.3(a)(iv)_);

(ii) any breach of any covenant made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in this
Agreement; or

(iii) any breach of any covenant made by the Company in this Agreement, which
such covenant of the Company requires performance after the Closing by the
Surviving Corporation, for periods after the Closing.

(c) _Indemnification by ICG Group_. From and after the Closing, ICG Group
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Parent Indemnities harmless from any
Damages suffered or paid, directly or indirectly, as a result or arising out
of:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty made as of the date hereof or deemed made as of the Closing by ICG
Group in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (including the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section

respective businesses of ICG Group or such Subsidiaries and any other business
of ICG Group and its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies),
including any liability or obligation that any of the Acquired Companies has
as a consequence of at any time being considered a single employer under
Section 414 of the Code with any other Person.

 

Section 9.3 _Third-Party Claims._

 

(a) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim") is made against any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.10_ (an "Indemnified Party"), and if such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this
_Article IX_ , such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify in writing the
Party obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a
Parent Indemnitee seeking indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, such
Parent Indemnitee shall promptly notify in writing the Stakeholder
Representative) (such notified party, the "Responsible Party") of such claims;
_provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Responsible Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Within
thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim, the Responsible
Party shall have the right to assume the conduct and control of the defense
thereof; _provided_ that such assumption and control shall occur only if (i)
the Third Party Claim involves solely a claim for monetary damages (
_provided_ that if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or
other equitable relief or relief for other than monetary damages against the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, can be readily separated from any related
claim for monetary damages, the Responsible Party shall be entitled to assume
the control of the defense of the portion relating to monetary damages), (ii)
the Responsible Party acknowledges in writing its irrevocable and
unconditional obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder
(subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article IX_ ), (iii) the
defense of such Third Party Claim by the Responsible Party would not
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Indemnified
Partys relationship with any of the Material Customers and (iv) in the case
of a Parent Indemnitee seeking indemnification, taking into account all other
pending claims for indemnification, the provisions of this _Article IX_
relating to the Escrow Account would not reasonably be expected to prevent
any Parent Indemnitee from being fully indemnified (subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article IX_ ) with the then remaining funds in the Escrow
Account with respect to such Third Party Claim in the event of an adverse
determination. Such conduct or control shall be at the expense of the
Responsible Party. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the
Responsible Party in connection therewith, and shall furnish such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal business hours
afforded to the Responsible Party and its agents and representatives to
records and information which have been identified by the Indemnified Party as
being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Responsible Party
shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or
defense through separate counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party, _provided_

 



-65-  that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such
Indemnified Party unless (A) the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by the Responsible Party in writing, (B) there exists a conflict
of interest between the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Responsible
Party, or (C) the Responsible Party has failed to diligently pursue the
defense and employ counsel. So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably
contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay
or settle any such claim without the Responsible Partys consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay or settle any such claim (whether or not appropriate notice has
been given by the Indemnified Party) related solely to money damages,
_provided_ that in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
by the Responsible Party or from the Escrow Account, as the case may be, for
such claim. The Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of the
Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or otherwise compromise or
discharge any Third Party Claim.

(b) All of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and shall furnish such records, information and testimony,
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and
appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations._

 

The rights of (x) the Parent Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 9.2(a)_ and  _Section 9.2(c)_ are subject to the
following limitations and methods of calculations and determination and (y)
the Holder Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 9.2(b)_ are subject to the limitations and methods of calculations
and determination set forth in clauses (a), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) below:

(a) the amount of any and all Damages will be determined net of (i) any
amounts actually recovered by the Parent Indemnitees under insurance policies
or indemnity, contribution or similar agreements with respect to such Damages
( _provided_ , that the amount deemed to be so recovered under insurance
policies shall be net of (A) the deductible for such policies and (B) any
increase in the premium for such policies arising out of or in connection with
such Damages), and (ii) the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized
by the Parent Indemnitees with respect to such Damages (taking into account
the receipt of the related indemnity payment) in the taxable year that such
Damages arise;

 

(b) the Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover for any Warranty
Loss (other than (x) a Warranty Loss related to a Company Fundamental Rep or
(y) a loss as a result of an ICG Fundamental Rep) unless the cumulative total
of the Damages suffered by the Parent Indemnitees related to Warranty Losses
exceeds $4,000,000 (the "Basket"), whereupon the Parent Indemnitees shall be
entitled to make a claim and indemnity hereunder only for the Damages in
excess of the Basket, and no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover
for any Warranty Loss unless the Damages suffered or paid by any
Parent Indemnitee for individual claims or a series of related claims exceeds
$150,000 (the "Minimum Claim Basket"); _provided_ that (i) neither the Basket
nor the Minimum Claim Basket shall apply to indemnity for Direct
Recourse Damages and (ii) the liability for Damages shall be limited as
provided in _Section 9.6_ ;

 



-66- (c) if an Indemnified Party has been indemnified for Damages hereunder, and at
any time thereafter an Indemnified Party recovers all or a portion of such
Damages from a third Person (including pursuant to any insurance policy or
indemnity, contribution or similar agreement), the Indemnified Party which
made such recovery shall promptly refund the amount paid with respect to such
Damages (up to the amount recovered from the third Person);

(d) an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement to
multiple recovery for the same Damages;

(e) except for any such damages that shall be payable as a result of a Third
Party Claim, an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement
to indemnification for punitive, special, consequential or exemplary damages,
or any damages associated with any diminution of value, loss of
business reputation or lost profits, opportunities, multiple of earnings,
future revenue, income, profits or EBITDA;

(f) if a Parent Indemnitee recovers Damages pursuant _Section 9.2(a)_, the
Holders shall be subrogated, to the extent of such recovery, to such Parent
Indemnitees rights against any third party with respect to such recovered
Damages;

 

(g) except as specified in _Section 9.6_ or the final paragraph of _Section
9.2(a)_ , in no event shall any Responsible Party be liable for damages in
excess of the Escrow Amount, absent fraud or Willful Misconduct;

(h) no Damages shall be recoverable by a Person to the extent such Damages
include or reflect amounts taken into consideration in the computation of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration, as adjusted by any adjustment of the pre-
Closing estimates pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_; and

 

(i) for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach for
indemnification purposes and the amount of any Damages that may be
the subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement and each certificate delivered
pursuant hereto shall be read without regard and without giving effect to the
term(s) "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" contained therein, except in
the case of the Qualified Representations.

Section 9.5  _Mitigation._

Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any indemnifiable Damages to the extent reasonably possible upon and
after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any indemnifiable Damages.

 



-67- Section 9.6 _Recovery of Damages; Exclusive Remedy._

 

(a) Subject to the limitations in this Article IX and this Section 9.6, if the
Closing occurs, the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the
amount of any claim for indemnification under this Article IX solely from the
Escrow Account, and such recovery shall be Parents sole and exclusive remedy
for indemnification claims under this Agreement absent fraud or Willful
Misconduct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Indemnitees shall be
entitled to recover the full amount of any claim for indemnification under
_Section 9.2(c)_ or _Section 9.10(b)_ solely from ICG Group ("ICG
Indemnified Amounts"); provided, further, that (i) with respect to claims for
Damages (A) relating to the Company Fundamental Reps or the ICG Fundamental
Reps, (the "Excluded Representations"), (B) under Section 9.2(a)(ii)
(including any obligation to make any payment pursuant to _Section 2.7_,
whether or not intended to be paid from the Escrow Account, or as arising
pursuant to _Section 11.12_),  _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section
9.2(a)(iv)_, or (C) pursuant to _Section 9.10_, (ii) without limiting the
foregoing, with respect to claims for Damages as a result of a breach of the
covenants contained in  _Section 7.8_ or _Section 7.17_, or (iii) with
respect to claims for Damages brought on the basis of fraud or Willful
Misconduct of the Company (clauses (i)-(iii) collectively, the "Direct
Recourse Damages"), Parent or a Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to (x)
recover directly from each Holder such Holders Pro Rata Share of the full
amount of such Direct Recourse Damages or (y) recover from the Escrow Account
the full amount of such Direct Recourse Damages or such Holders Pro Rata
Share of the full amount of such Direct Recourse Damages from such Holders
Subaccount (such amount, to the extent withdrawn from the Escrow Account, the
"Escrow Recovered Amount"), in each case at the election of Parent and
subject to the procedures set forth in the immediately following sentence. If
Parent or a Parent Indemnitee elects to recover any Direct Recourse Damages
directly from the Holders as contemplated by clause (x) of the immediately
preceding sentence: (A) it shall request payment from all Holders directly to
the extent it shall have an address of record for such Holder and (B) if a
Holder fails to pay such Direct Recourse Damages to Parent or a Parent
Indemnitee within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such request, then
Parent or a Parent Indemnitee may recover such Holders Pro Rata Share of the
Direct Recourse Damages from such Holders Subaccount within the Escrow
Account (without limiting any other rights or remedies of Parent or any Parent
Indemnitee), and the Stakeholder Representative and Parent shall execute joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute such amount from such
Subaccount(s); _provided_ that the Stakeholder Representative will not be
required to execute any such joint written instruction until Parent has first
provided notice to the Stakeholder Representative that such Holder has failed
to pay such Direct Recourse Damages. Upon any payment from a Subaccount
therefor, such Holders obligation to pay such Escrow Recovered Amount
directly to the Parent Indemnitee shall be suspended and in lieu thereof,
such Holder shall have the continuing obligation to deposit funds equal to
the portion of the Escrow Recovered Amount for which he, she or it had
liability hereunder into such Holders Subaccount within the Escrow Account
for the term of the Escrow Account and during such period. If such Holder
shall fail to deposit in such Holders Subaccount within the Escrow Account
amounts equal to the Escrow Recovered Amount as required by this _Section
9.6_ and such Subaccount within the Escrow Account is depleted and is
insufficient to satisfy Damages for which a Parent Indemnitee would be
entitled to collection from such Subaccount within the Escrow Account in
accordance with this _Article IX_ , then such Holder shall have
the obligation to pay directly to Parent or a Parent

 



-68-  Indemnitee the amount of such Escrow Recovered Amounts recovered from such
Holders Subaccount within the Escrow Account. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 9.6(a), distributions to a Parent Indemnitee from the Escrow
Account shall be withdrawn from the Subaccounts on a Pro Rata Share.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary and
except as set forth in _Section 9.6(a)_, after the Closing, on the date that
the amount of cash in the Escrow Account is reduced to zero, the Parent
Indemnitees shall have no further rights to indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ other than for Claims for Direct Recourse Damages. Notwithstanding
anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary and subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article IX_ , after the Closing,
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IX_ shall be
the exclusive remedy for the parties for any misrepresentation of any
representation or warranty or breach of covenant or other provision contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; _provided_
that none of the limitations contained in this _Article IX_ shall limit any
party from pursuing such partys rights pursuant to _Section 11.12_.

 

Section 9.7 _Claims Procedure._

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice (the "Claim
Notice") to the Responsible Party after becoming aware of any Damages for
which the Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification. The Claim Notice
shall describe the Damages in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary) of the Damages that has been or may be suffered by
the Indemnified Party. Except as provided in _Section 9.3_, the failure to
provide a Claim Notice will not relieve the Responsible Party of any Liability
that it may have to any Indemnified Party. Within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of a Claim Notice, the Responsible Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response in which the Responsible Party will
either: (i) agree that the Responsible Party is entitled to receive all of the
Damages at issue in the Claim Notice; or (ii) dispute the Indemnified Partys
entitlement to indemnification by delivering to the Indemnified Party a
written notice (an "Objection Notice") setting forth in reasonable detail each
disputed item, the basis for each such disputed item and certifying that all
such disputed items are being disputed in good faith. If the Responsible Party
delivers an Objection Notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days
after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the dispute may be resolved by any
legally available means consistent with the provisions of _Section 11.3_. If
any Parent Indemnitee is the Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ , the parties will
contemporaneously deliver to the Escrow Agent copies of each Claim Notice and
Objection Notice in connection with such claim. The Stakeholder Representative
and Parent shall promptly execute joint written instructions to distribute an
amount from the Escrow Account to a Parent Indemnitee equal to the amount of
the Damages to which it is entitled if no Objection Notice has been filed as
provided herein, and shall direct that all distributions to a Parent
Indemnitee from the Escrow Account shall be withdrawn from the Subaccounts on
a Pro Rata Share basis except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.6(a)_.

 



-69- (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good-faith negotiation and
after thirty (30) days after delivery of an Objection Notice, either Parent or
the Stakeholder Representative on behalf of the Holders may bring an action
against the other to resolve the dispute. To the extent that an Indemnified
Party is permitted under this _Article IX_ to seek recovery directly against
one or more Holders, then each such Holder will promptly, and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after the final resolution of any
dispute in accordance with this _Article IX_ , wire transfer to Parent
immediately available funds equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount of
Losses determined in accordance with this _Article IX_. If the amount of the
Damages so determined is an estimate, then the Stakeholder Representative or
the applicable Holder will be required to make such payment within five (5)
Business Days of the date that the amount of such Damages is finally
determined.

 

Section 9.8 _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration._

 

Any payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 9.9 _Agreement to be Bound._

 

Each Holder, by virtue of accepting the Closing Per Share Cash Consideration
through the delivery of its Letter of Transmittal pursuant to  _Section
2.6(c)_ or other consent to the terms hereof (including pursuant to _Section
7.13_) or Award Payments shall be deemed to accept and agree to be bound by
and comply with the terms and obligations of this _Article IX_.

Section 9.10 _Indemnification for Taxes._

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Holders shall indemnify the Parent
Indemnitees, without duplication, from any Damages suffered or paid, directly
or indirectly, as a result or arising out of (i) any Tax of any Person (other
than any member of the ICG Consolidated Group or an Acquired Company) imposed
on an Acquired Company as a transferee or successor, by contract (other
than any contract, agreement or arrangement a principal purpose of which is
not the allocation or sharing of Taxes) or pursuant to any Law (including
Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations), which Tax relates to an event,
status or transaction occurring or existing on or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) any Tax of any Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
portion thereof); (iii) any Transfer Taxes that are not the obligation of
Parent under  _Section 7.8(g)_ and any other income Tax imposed on any
Holder as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iv) any breach of any covenant set forth in _Section
7.8_.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, ICG Group shall indemnify the Parent
Indemnitees, without duplication, from any Damages suffered or paid, directly

member of the ICG Consolidated Group and (ii) any Tax of any member of the ICG
Consolidated Group (other than an Acquired Company), imposed on an Acquired
Company as a transferee or successor, by contract (other than any contract,
agreement or arrangement a principal purpose of which is not the allocation or
sharing of Taxes) or pursuant to any Law (including Section 1.1502-6 of
the Treasury Regulations), which Tax relates to an event, status or
transaction occurring or existing on or prior to the Closing Date;

 



-70- (c) The indemnification obligations under this _Section 9.10_ shall survive
until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.

(d) Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 9.10_ for any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were included as a
Current Liability on the Preliminary Closing Statement in the Companys actual
calculation of Preliminary Net Working Capital (without giving effect to
whether the Preliminary Net Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Net Working
Capital) as finally adjusted pursuant to _Sections 2.7(b)_ and _2.7(c)_.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of Taxes for the portion of such period that is a Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall (A) in the case of any Tax based on income or receipts, or
payments giving rise to a withholding obligation, be determined on the basis
of a deemed closing of the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and (B) in
the case of any Tax not covered by clause (A), be equal to the amount of such
Tax for the entire Pre-Closing Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in such period prior to and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number
of days in such period.

Section 10.1 _Termination of Agreement._

 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date as
follows:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by the written notice of the Company to Parent if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before January 6, 2014 (the "Outside Date"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
10.1(b)_ shall not be available to the Company if the failure of the Company
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of,
or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the condition set forth in
_Section 8.1(b)_ has not been satisfied as of the Outside Date, then the
Outside Date shall automatically extend to June 2, 2014.

(c) by the written notice of Parent to the Company if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before the Outside Date (as extended pursuant to _Section
10.1(b)_ if applicable); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this  _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be available to

under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

 



-71- (d) by either the Company or Parent, upon written notice to the other, if any
court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Entity shall
have issued a statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such statute, rule,
regulation, order, decree or injunction or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable, unless the failure to consummate the Closing because
of such action by a Governmental Entity shall be due to the failure of
Parent, if Parent is seeking to terminate this Agreement, or of the Company,
if the Company is seeking to terminate this Agreement, to have fulfilled any
of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

(e) by written notice of the Company to Parent if (x) Parent or Merger
Subsidiary shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement to be complied with by it such that the condition set forth
in _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_ could not be satisfied, or (y) there exists a breach
of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Subsidiary contained in
this Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ or
_Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ could not be satisfied and, in the case of either (x) or
(y), such breach is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date; _provided_
that the Company may not terminate pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ if
Parents breach has been primarily caused by a breach of any provision of this
Agreement by the Company; or

 

(f) by written notice of Parent to the Company if (x) the Company or ICG Group
shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement to be complied with by the Company or ICG Group such that the
condition set forth in _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ could not be satisfied, or (y)
there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or ICG
Group contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_ could
not be satisfied and, in the case of (x) or (y), such breach is incapable of
being cured by the Outside Date; _provided_ that Parent may not terminate
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)_ if the Companys or ICG Groups breach has
been primarily caused by a breach of any provision of this Agreement by
Parent.

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination._

 

In the event of termination of this Agreement by a party hereto pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the
terminating party to the other parties hereto, and this Agreement shall
thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, without any liability
or obligation on the part of any party hereto, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned without further action by
the parties hereto, except that the provisions of _Sections 7.3_, _11.1_ ,
_11.2_ , _11.3_ , _11.4_ , _11.5_ , _11.6_ , _11.7_ , _11.8_ ,  _11.9_ ,
_11.10_ , _11.11_ and this _Section 10.2_ shall survive the termination of

or warranties set forth in this Agreement, or from the material breach by a
party of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, each
of the Company, ICG Group, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be,
shall be fully liable for any and all Damages of the other parties as a result
of any willful and material breach or inaccuracy by such party prior to

Section 11.5 _Headings._

 

The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting
or construing any of the provisions contained in this Agreement.

Section 11.6 _Fees and Expenses._

 

Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each party hereto shall bear
its own costs and expenses (including investment advisory and legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, it being agreed that Transaction Expenses may
be paid by the Company prior to the Closing or after the Closing so long as
any Transaction Expenses that are not paid prior to the Closing or otherwise
taken into account in computing Unpaid Transaction Expenses.

 

Section 11.7 _Entire Agreement._

 

This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the other
Transaction Agreements executed in connection with this Agreement constitute
the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between
the parties with respect to such subject matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this Agreement shall not supersede the terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in effect until
expiration or termination thereof in accordance with its terms and this
Agreement, except that paragraphs 8 and 9 the Confidentiality Agreement shall
no longer be effective as of the date hereof.

Section 11.8 _Interpretation._  

(a) When a reference is made to an article, exhibit, section or schedule, such
reference shall be to an article, exhibit, section or schedule of or to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

 



-77- (c) Unless the context requires otherwise, words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, and the use
of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the other genders.

(d) References to "dollars" or "$" are to U.S. dollars.

(e) The terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and derivative or
similar words refer to this entire Agreement.

(f) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made available or delivered pursuant
hereto, unless otherwise defined therein.

 

(g) The terms "or," "any" and "either" are not exclusive.

 

(h) The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to

" _if_ ". References to a Person are also to its successors and permitted
assigns.

(i) This Agreement was prepared jointly by the parties hereto and no rule
that it be construed against the drafter will have any application in its
construction or interpretation.

 

Section 11.9 _Disclosure_.

 

The inclusion of information in any Section of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material or
that such matter actually constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of,
any Law, Permit or Contract or other topic to which such disclosure is
applicable. The disclosure of any matter in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other section
of the Company Disclosure Letter, notwithstanding the omission of a cross
reference thereto, to the extent the relevance of such matter to such section
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure. The Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to disclose matters or liabilities and the
effects thereof to the extent the matter or amount of the liability and the
effects thereof are disclosed with reasonable particularity in the Company
Disclosure Letter; the mere listing of a Contract or other item in the Company
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to disclose all matters related thereto
or effects therefrom unless specifically set forth or referenced in the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that disclosures will only be deemed
made for any Company Fundamental Rep or pursuant to _Section 3.13_ or ICG
Fundamental Rep if set forth on the schedule that corresponds to any such
representation and warranty; provided, further, that solely with respect to
_Section 3.14(a)_ except as otherwise expressly set forth thereon, the
foregoing shall not limit any cross-references or deemed disclosures for
purposes of determining the scope of Company Contracts. The Company
Disclosure Letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the specific
provisions of this Agreement and nothing contained therein constitutes a
representation, warranty or covenant of any party to this Agreement.

 



-78- Section 11.10 _Waiver and Amendment_.

 

This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written
mutual agreement executed and delivered by the Company and Parent. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any party to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the
party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by
the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligations, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

 

Section 11.11 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
permitted assigns and, except for _Section 7.6_ and  _Section 11.17_ and
provisions applicable to Accenture LLP, nothing herein express or implied
shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties
hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

Section 11.12 _Enforcement_.

 

Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages will be inadequate and the non-breaching party will have no adequate
remedy at Law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party
shall have the right to seek to obtain, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in their favor at Law or in equity, specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security) to enforce their rights and the other partys obligations
hereunder. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that prior to the Closing,
any other party hereto shall have the right to seek to specifically enforce
the obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not
alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of
such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege.

Section 11.13 _Severability_.

 

If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to
any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof and all other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.

 



-79- Section 11.14 _Counterparts; Signatures_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together
shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding upon all of the
parties hereto notwithstanding the fact that all parties are not signatory to
the original or the same counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement,
facsimile or electronic scanned signatures shall be deemed originals, and the
parties agree to exchange original signatures as promptly as possible.

 

Section 11.15 _Time is of the Essence_.

 

Time is of the essence for each and every provision of this Agreement.
Whenever the last day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or
any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day which is not a Business Day, the
party having such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge
such duty on the next succeeding day which is a regular Business Day.

 

Section 11.16 _Stakeholder Representative_.

 

(a) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
holders of Common Stock or acceptance of the Closing Per Share Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.6 or Award Payment shall constitute the grant to the
Stakeholder Representative of the full power and authority, to act as agent
and attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution to act in the name,
place and of each Holders stead with respect to the transactions
contemplated by, and all the terms and provisions of, this Agreement and to
act on such Holders behalf in any dispute, litigation or arbitration
involving this Agreement and to do or refrain from doing all such further
acts and things, and execute all such agreements, certificates, instruments or
other documents, as the Stakeholder Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the power to (i) execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement
(with such modifications or changes therein as to which the Stakeholder
Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to
such amendments or modifications thereto as the Stakeholder Representative, in
its sole discretion, determines to be desirable, (ii) interpret the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the documents to be executed and delivered
in connection herewith, including _Article IX_ and the Escrow Agreement,
(iii) execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers,
undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted to be
given in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (iv) receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (v)
agree to negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, assume the
defense of claims, demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the sole judgment of the Stakeholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, including taking all
such actions as may be necessary under _Article IX_ , (vi) give and receive
notices and communications, (vii) authorize delivery to Parent of funds from
the Escrow Account or any portion thereof in satisfaction of claims brought by
Parent for Damages, (viii) receive and distribute the consideration payable
hereunder, including payments from the Escrow Account and any earnings and
proceeds thereon, and (ix) take all actions (or refrain from taking actions)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stakeholder Representative as
agent for and on behalf of the Holders in connection with this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

 



-80- (b) The appointment of the Stakeholder Representative shall be deemed coupled
with an interest and is hereby irrevocable. The provisions of this _Section
11.16_ are independent and severable, shall constitute an irrevocable power of
attorney, coupled with an interest and surviving death or dissolutions,
granted by the Holders to the Stakeholder Representative, and shall be
binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns of each such Holder.

 

(c) The Stakeholder Representative shall act for the Holder on all of the
matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the
Stakeholder Representative reasonably believes to be in the best interest of
the Holders and consistent with their obligations under this Agreement, and
shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify this Agreement, waive any condition
contained herein, enter into or execute any agreement, certificate,
instrument or other document, or do or refrain from doing any other act or
deed, that has the effect of adversely and disproportionately impacting any
Holder relative to the other Holders in a manner that is inconsistent with
the relative rights of such disproportionately impacted Holder under this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of such Holder. The Stakeholder
Representative shall not be responsible to the Holders for any Damages they
may suffer by reason of the performance by the Stakeholder Representative of
the duties of the Stakeholder Representative under this Agreement, other than
loss or damage arising from a willful and knowing violation of the Law or this
Agreement by the Stakeholder Representative.

(d) Each Holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Stakeholder
Representative from, and promptly reimburse the Stakeholder Representative
for, any loss, damage, fees, costs or expenses arising from the performance of
the duties of the Stakeholder Representative hereunder, including the cost of
any legal counsel or accountants retained by the Stakeholder Representative
on behalf of the Holders or otherwise, but excluding any loss or damage
arising from a willful and knowing violation of the Law or this Agreement by
the Stakeholder Representative. All expenses, if any, incurred by
the Stakeholder Representative in connection with the performance of its
duties as the Stakeholder Representative will be borne and paid by the Holders
according to their Pro Rata Share. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Stakeholder Representative shall hold the Stakeholder Representative Expense
Amount in a dedicated account for the benefit of the Holders and use the
Stakeholder Representative Expense Amount to pay for any costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the Stakeholder Representative in carrying out its
duties as the Stakeholder Representative under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement or to pay costs or expenses to be incurred by the
Stakeholder Agreement as provided in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement. The Stakeholder Representative, from time to time based on its
reasonable discretion, shall pay to the Paying Agent or the Company for
distribution to the Holders their respective Pro Rata Share of any amount
remaining from the Stakeholder Representative Expense Amount.

(e) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Stakeholder Representative
taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the Stakeholder
Representative pursuant to this _Section 11.16_ shall be conclusive and
binding upon each Holder, and no Holder shall have the right to object to,
dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 



-81- (f) Parent and the Company shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon the
communications, instructions and decisions of the Stakeholder Representative
relating to the foregoing as the communications, instructions or directions of
the Holders. The Stakeholder Representative shall have the authority to act as
agent for and on behalf of all Holders hereunder and shall be held liable or
accountable in any manner for any act or omission of the Stakeholder
Representative in such capacity.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 11.16_, the
provisions of this _Section 11.16_ do not affect any right of Parent (except
for rights granted in Section 11-16(f) hereunder) or create any obligation on
