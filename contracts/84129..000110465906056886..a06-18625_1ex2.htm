delivery to Seller of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working
Capital Statement (the " _Seller Review Period_ ") in which to notify
Purchaser in writing (the " _Seller Objection Notice_ ") of any good faith
disagreement with the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Working
Capital Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the items or
amounts with which Seller disagrees and the basis for such disagreement and

the Seller Review Period, Seller shall be deemed to agree in all respects
with the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement
and the items and amounts reflected thereon shall be final and binding upon
Purchaser and Seller.

  

(c) _Review by Accountants_. If a Seller Objection Notice is properly and
timely delivered, Purchaser and Seller shall use good faith efforts to
resolve their differences with respect to the Seller Objection within 30
calendar days after Purchasers receipt of the Seller Objection Notice. If
Purchaser and Seller resolve their differences with respect to the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Working Capital Statement within such
30-day period, the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Working
Capital Statement shall be modified as necessary to reflect such agreement
and, as so modified, shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller.
 Any differences with respect to the Seller Objection not resolved
by Purchaser and Seller within such 30-day period shall be submitted for
the purpose of resolving such dispute to such nationally recognized
public accounting firm as shall be mutually agreed between Purchaser and
Seller and, if not so mutually agreed within 5 calendar days, shall

shall be instructed to render their decision in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and GAAP (as modified in accordance with the illustration set
forth in Exhibit 1.4(a)) and shall consider only those items or amounts
on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and/or in the Closing Working Capital
Statement as to which Seller has, in the Seller Objection Notice, disagreed
and such other issues as may reasonably be affected by the items as to which
Seller has so disagreed. The Accountants shall deliver to Purchaser and
Seller, as promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 calendar days after
the Accountants are engaged, a written report setting forth their resolution

     

   

and, if applicable, their calculation of the disputed items or amounts. In no
event shall the Accountants determination result in Closing Working Capital
that is greater than that set forth in the Seller Objection Notice or less
than that set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement. The parties
shall promptly comply with all reasonable requests by the Accountants for
information, books, records and similar items. Upon delivery of
the Accountants report to Purchaser and Seller, such report and the
calculations set forth therein shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and
Seller. The fees and expenses relating to such review and report from the
Accountants shall be allocated between the parties in inverse proportion to
the resolution of the disagreements by the Accountants such that the party
whose determination of Closing Working Capital as first submitted to the
Accountants is closer to the Accountants determination of Closing Working
Capital pays a smaller percentage of such fees and expenses.

  

(d) _Cooperation_. Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, shall provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to each other
in the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working
Capital Statement and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this

Capital, or (iii) with no adjustment if Closing Working Capital is an amount
between $1,188,000,000 and $1,212,000,000 (inclusive).

  

(f) _Final Payment_. Within three Business Days after the calculation of

1.4(c), as applicable, (i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of

equal to the amount, if any, by which the Final Cash Consideration exceeds
the Estimated Cash Consideration, or (ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Purchaser, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Cash
Consideration exceeds the Final Cash Consideration (the amount of the payment
pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 1.4(f) being referred
to as the " _Final Payment_ "), in either case, (A) together with interest on
the Final Payment at the Applicable Rate (as defined immediately below) from
and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment
and (B) giving effect to any amounts paid pursuant to Section 1.4(b). As

Section 3.6 _Purchaser SEC Filings_.

  

(a) Since February 27, 2005, Purchaser has filed with the SEC all
Purchaser SEC Documents required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act.
As of the respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Purchaser SEC Documents, including any financial statements or
schedules included therein, (i) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to such Purchaser SEC Documents and (ii) did not at the

to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances

     

   

under which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of
Purchaser included in the Purchaser SEC Documents (i) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved (except
as noted therein, and, in the case of such unaudited financial statements,
for the absence of footnotes and recurring year-end audit adjustments normal
in nature and amount) and (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial condition, results of the operations and cash flows of Purchaser
and the Subsidiaries of Purchaser for the periods therein set forth subject
to, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, recurring year-end
audit adjustments normal in nature and amount.

to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP.

relating to Purchaser and (d) there are no judgments, decrees, injunctions,
rules or orders of any Governmental Authority relating to Purchaser, except
in the case of clauses (a) and (d), as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.8 _Purchaser Financing_.

  

(a) Attached as Exhibit 3.8 hereto is a true and complete copy of the letter,
dated August 23, 2006, from Citicorp North America, Inc. and Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. to Purchaser (and together with the related fee letter, a true
and complete copy of which has been provided to Seller, the " _Financing
Commitment_ "), pursuant to which the lenders that are parties thereto have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the
amounts set forth therein for the purposes of, among other things, financing
Purchasers acquisition of the Business (the " _Financing_ "). The Financing
Commitment has not been amended or modified prior to the date of this
Agreement, and the commitments contained in the Financing Commitment have not
been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The Financing Commitment is
in full force and effect. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitment. The
aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by
the Financing Commitment, together with Purchasers cash and cash equivalents
on hand at the time of the Closing, will be sufficient for Purchaser to pay
the Estimated Cash Consideration and to pay all related fees and expenses.
Purchaser has no reason as of the date hereof to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment within
its control will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be made
available to Purchaser on the Closing Date.

     

   

(b) None of the reports, financial statements, certificates or other
information (i) in respect of Purchaser and its subsidiaries, (ii) in respect
of the Transactions (as defined in the Financing Commitment) other than in
respect of the Company or the Business or (iii) to the knowledge of
Purchaser, in respect of the Company or the Business, in each case furnished
by Purchaser or on behalf of Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates to Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., Citicorp North America, Inc. or any of their Affiliates
prior to the date of the Financing Commitment in connection with the
structuring, arrangement or syndication of the Facilities (as defined in the
Financing Commitment) or the arrangement of the Amendments (as defined in the
Financing Commitment), taken as a whole, contains any material misstatement
of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
materially misleading; _provided_  that with respect to Projections (as
defined in the Financing Commitment), Purchaser represents only that such
Projections were prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time.

  

Section 3.9 _Purchaser Indentures_. The pledge of the capital stock or
membership interests of JCG LLC, if applicable, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as contemplated in the Financing Commitment or the granting of
additional liens pursuant to the Financing will not result in a breach of the
indentures governing Purchasers 9.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2011, 8.125%
Senior Secured Notes due 2010, 7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2015 and 9.25%
Senior Notes due 2013.

nor any Subsidiary of Purchaser has any material Liabilities, except
(i) Liabilities set forth in Section 3.10 of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, (ii) Liabilities that are disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Documents,
(iii) Liabilities that are reflected, or for which reserves were established,
on the audited consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser as of March 4, 2006
included in the Purchaser SEC Documents, and (iv) Liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice since March 4,
2006.

  

Section 3.11 _Compliance with Laws_. Since July 31, 2004, Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries have been in compliance with all Laws applicable to them
and neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of any failure to comply with any such Laws, in each case, except for
such breaches together with all other breaches of such Laws, as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.12 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as expressly contemplated
by this Agreement, since March 4, 2006: (i) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
have operated only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (ii) there has not occurred any Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect or any fact, occurrence, condition, change, development, effect,
circumstance or event that would, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have or result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.13 _Brokers and Finders_. Other than Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
and Rothschild Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
Purchaser, no broker, finder or similar intermediary has acted for or on
behalf of, or is entitled to any brokers, finders or similar fee or other
commission from, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

     

   

Section 3.14 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Purchaser and
its representatives have been permitted full and complete access to
the nonprivileged books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts, and
other properties, Assets and documents of Seller, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries that it and its representatives have desired or
requested to see or review, and Purchaser and its representatives have had a
full opportunity to meet with the employees of Seller, the Company and the

warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
the Business, or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Business furnished or made
available to Purchaser and its representatives, except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the exhibits hereto.
Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from Seller, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person in determining to enter
into this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the exhibits
hereto.

Justice or other Governmental Authority under the Antitrust Laws with respect
to this transaction. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws, each
party to this Agreement shall use all reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other party all information required for any application, filing or
submission to be made pursuant or related to the HSR Act, or any applicable
Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

without approval of the party providing the non-public information.  Each
party to this Agreement shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of
any communication with, or any intention to enter into, any

amended, and any other United States federal or state or foreign Laws that
are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust
Laws_ "). In connection therewith and subject to Section 4.7(d), if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as inconsistent with or violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and
Seller shall (by negotiation, litigation or otherwise) cooperate and use its
reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such action or
proceeding, including any administrative or judicial action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by vigorously
pursuing all available administrative and judicial appeals, unless, by mutual
agreement, Purchaser and Seller decide that litigation is not in their
respective best interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 4.7 shall limit the
right of a party to this Agreement to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c), so long as such party to this Agreement has until that time
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 4.7. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such
transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

  

(c) Subject to Section 4.7(d), each of the parties to this Agreement agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all

and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any), (ii)
the preparation of the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 4.16(a) below),
(iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry

Subsidiaries and Affiliates officers, directors, employees and partners as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters set forth
in Section 4.7(a), Section 4.7(b) or this Section 4.7(c).

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.7, neither
Purchaser nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any
objections asserted under Antitrust Laws by any Governmental Authority or
Governmental Authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to divest any of its businesses or assets, or take or agree to
take any other action or agree to any limitation or restriction, that the
Board of Directors of Purchaser reasonably determines in good faith, after
considering the advice of its management and legal and financial advisors,
(i) to be materially adverse to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole or (ii) would materially impair the overall benefits expected, as of
the date hereof, to be realized from the acquisition of the Business.
Purchaser agrees that divestiture or release of assets (tangible or
intangible) representing, or the imposition of conditions affecting, store-
level Adjusted EBITDA (as defined immediately below) of up to an aggregate of
$60 million before advertising and corporate administration expenses, for the
most recently completed fiscal year (the " _$60 Million Adjusted EBITDA
Threshold_ ") is not materially adverse to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole nor would it materially impair the overall benefits expected
to be realized from the acquisition of the Business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the $60 Million Adjusted EBITDA Threshold is exceeded, it shall be
deemed to materially impair the overall benefits expected to be realized by
Purchaser with respect to the acquisition of the Business. As used in this
Agreement, " _Adjusted EBITDA_ " means net earnings before interest expense,
income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense and other non-cash
charges, or adjustments for non-operating items set forth on Exhibit 4.7(d).

will use reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser or the Company any remaining properties, books, records, Contracts,
information and documents relating to the Business that are not already in
the possession or control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

  

(b) Subject to Section 7.6 (relating to Tax records), Seller and Purchaser
agree that each of them will preserve and keep the records held by it
relating to the Business for a period of ten years from the Closing Date in
accordance with their respective corporate records retention policies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to disposing of any such records in
accordance with such policies, the applicable party shall provide written
notice to the other party of its intent

     

   

to dispose of such records and shall provide such other party the opportunity
to take ownership and possession of such records (at such other partys
sole expense) to the extent they relate to such other partys business
or obligations within 30 days after such notice is delivered. If such other
party does not confirm its intention in writing to take ownership and
possession of such records within such 30-day period, the party who possesses
the records may proceed with the disposition of such records. Seller
and Purchaser shall make such records available to the other as may be
reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, legal proceedings against, or governmental
investigations of Seller or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
or in order to enable Seller or Purchaser to comply with their respective
obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby.

hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless, in the reasonable judgment of Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Seller or Purchaser lists its
securities; _provided_  that to the extent required by applicable Law or by
the rules of any stock exchange, the party intending to make such release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts consistent with such
applicable Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text
thereof.

(b) _Certain Bonus Payments_.

  

(i) _Annual Bonus for Fiscal Year in which the Closing Occurs_. Purchaser
agrees that it shall cause the Company on or about the normal payment date of
bonuses consistent with Purchasers past practice (but in any event not later
than 70 days after the last day of the Companys fiscal year in which the
Closing occurs), to make bonus payments to the bonus eligible Business
Employees (as determined by the Company under the annual bonus plans
disclosed in Exhibit 4.12(b)(i)) who remain employed as of the bonus payment
date or who are terminated by the Company or a Company Subsidiary after the
Closing but prior to the bonus payment date, equal to such employees target
bonus, pro-rated for the portion of the Companys fiscal year that has
elapsed prior to the Closing Date, to the extent not previously paid. For
this purpose, the bonus eligible Business Employees bonus shall equal 100%
of such employees target bonus, as disclosed to Purchaser in Exhibit
4.12(b)(i) by employee classification and accrued on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, multiplied by a fraction,

     

   

the numerator of which is the number of days from the beginning of the
Companys fiscal year in which the Closing occurs through the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is 365. In the event that any bonus eligible
Business Employee is not paid such pro rata portion of such employees target
bonus in compliance with the time limitations set forth above, the aggregate
of all such unpaid amounts to the extent accrued for on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be promptly paid by Purchaser to Seller.  Each
Continuing Employees bonus for periods following the Closing Date shall be
determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion.

  

(ii) _Special Incentive Payment_. The parties agree that the Company shall
pay, on or about November 30, 2006, a special incentive bonus (the " _Special
Bonus_ ") to each bonus eligible associate (as determined by the Company
under the annual incentive plan for fiscal year 2006) employed in the Warwick
(Service Road and Post Road) and Largo offices, equal to 50% of the bonus
incentive that would have been paid in respect of the 2006 fiscal year under
the annual incentive plan if the Company and the individual had achieved
target performance of 100% (personal and Company portions). Exhibit
4.12(b)(ii) sets forth the additional terms and conditions applicable to the
payment of the Special Bonus, which is being paid in light of job performance
through the second quarter of the 2007 fiscal year. Seller agrees that it
shall be solely responsible for the full amount of the Special Bonus and
shall cause the targeted amount of the Special Bonus described above to be
accrued on the Companys balance sheet. In the event that the Closing occurs
prior to the time that the Special Bonus is paid, Purchaser agrees that it
shall cause the Company to pay the Special Bonus, to the extent of the
accrual set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

  

(c) _Employee Benefits_. For a period of at least six months beginning on
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
continue to provide the Continuing Employees for so long as the Continuing
Employee remains so employed, with employee benefits which are, in the
aggregate, substantially similar to those provided under the Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date, or those provided by Purchaser to its
similarly situated employees, except that Purchaser shall not be required to
continue under any Benefit Plan any investment fund intended to invest
primarily or exclusively in Jean Coutu USA Common Shares or Seller common
stock, or any equity-based compensation plans. Notwithstanding the generality
of the foregoing, for a period of twelve months following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide
severance benefits pursuant to the Company Transition Pay Program, a true and
complete copy of which has been provided to Purchaser, which shall be in lieu
of any other severance benefits otherwise payable to the Business Employees
under any Benefit Plan, and shall be reduced by (or provided co-extensively
with) any payments required to be made under WARN.  Purchaser agrees that
for any employee benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates made
available to the Continuing Employees after the Closing, such employees will
receive credit for the years of service credited to them prior to the Closing
by Seller, the Company or a Company Subsidiary for the purpose of determining
eligibility and vesting under such employee benefit plan and, with respect to
any applicable vacation pay plan only, for the purpose of determining the
amount of accrued benefits under such plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such recognition of service shall not result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. With respect to any welfare plan in
which employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are eligible
to participate

     

   

after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions were satisfied
under the welfare plans of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each such employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan.

  

(d) _Equity-Based Awards_. Seller shall amend or cause to be amended the
terms of the equity compensation plans maintained by it and its Affiliates to
provide (to the extent not already provided thereunder) that any Business
Employee shall have the maximum period of time permitted under Section 409A
of the Code and the published guidance thereunder following such employees
termination of employment to exercise any then vested equity based awards
under such plans; _provided_ that in no event shall Seller be required to
extend the post-employment exercise period of any equity based awards by more
than two years after the Closing, and _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller
shall not be required to take any action to accelerate the vesting of any
equity based awards under such plans held by Business Employees. Seller and
Purchaser agree that any and all income tax deductions attributable to the
exercise, in accordance with the terms of such plans (including as modified
by this Section 4.12(d)), on or prior to the Closing Date, of any equity
based award (whether or not such award was vested on or before the Closing)
granted to a Business Employee thereunder, shall be claimed only by the
Company or the appropriate Company Subsidiary in the Pre-Closing Period (as
defined in Section 7.3 below), unless prohibited by applicable Laws.

  

(e) _Employment Discussions_. After the date hereof and prior to the Closing
Date, Seller and the Company shall provide Purchaser with access, during
reasonable business hours and upon reasonable notice, to (i) all field,
corporate and distribution center management personnel for purposes of
determining the staffing needs of the Business following the Closing Date and
identifying additional personnel of the Business to be interviewed by
Purchaser prior to the Closing Date and (ii) to additional groups of
personnel identified by Purchaser.  Purchaser and Seller agree to reasonably
coordinate in connection with such interviews and further agree that a
representative of Seller listed in Exhibit 4.12(e) may be present for such
interviews if desired by Seller. Purchaser agrees that it shall use
its reasonable best efforts to conduct such interviews in a manner that
causes minimum disruption to the Business.

  

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Section 4.12
shall not confer upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement any
rights, benefits or remedies.

  

(g) _Cooperation_. Seller agrees that it shall provide Purchaser with advance
copies of all employee communications relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
severance and severance benefits) from and after the date hereof and through
the Closing. Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate in order to facilitate
all provisions of Section 4.12 of this Agreement.

     

   

Section 4.13 _WARN Act_.

  

(a) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a list
of the name and site of employment of any and all employees of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries who have experienced, or will experience, an
employment loss or layoff, as defined by WARN requiring notice to employees
in the event of a closing or layoff, within 90 days prior to the Closing
Date. Seller shall update this list up to and including the Closing Date.

  

(b) Seller shall not, and shall cause the Company or any Company Subsidiary
not to, at any time within 90 days before the Closing Date, without
complying fully with the notice requirements and other requirements of WARN,
effectuate (i) a plant closing as defined in WARN affecting any site
of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site
of employment of the Company; (ii) a mass layoff as defined in WARN
affecting any site of employment of the Company; or (iii) any similar action
under WARN requiring notice to employees in the event of an employment loss
or layoff.

  

(c) Seller shall be responsible for any Liability under WARN or any other
applicable Law with respect to any employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries who are terminated before the Closing and Purchaser shall be
responsible for any Liability under WARN or any other applicable Law with
respect to any employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who are
terminated as of or after the Closing.

  

Section 4.14 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. From and after the date hereof
and through the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not (and
shall cause its Affiliates not to), without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, solicit or hire any employee of JCG LLC,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than clerical or non-salaried
employees); _provided_ ,  _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller
from (a) engaging in the general solicitation (whether by newspaper, trade
publication or other periodical) of employees (or hiring any employees that
respond to such general solicitation) so long as such solicitation is not
targeted or focused at employees of JCG LLC, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or (b) soliciting or hiring any such employee (other than
clerical or non-salaried employees) who is no longer employed by JCG LLC, the
Company or a Company Subsidiary and has not been an employee of JCG LLC, the
Company or a Company Subsidiary for at least six months prior to such
solicitation or employment by Seller or its Affiliates.

  

Section 4.15 _Non-Competition_.

  

(a) For a period of five years after the Closing Date, Seller agrees that it
will not, and will cause its Affiliates (except for Michel Coutu, for whom
the applicable period will be for three years after the Closing Date and
whose obligation is contained in a letter agreement between Michel Coutu and
Purchaser, dated as of the date hereof) not to, directly or indirectly,
whether as principal, agent, partner, officer, director, stockholder,
employee, consultant or otherwise, alone or in association with any other
Person (other than as a stockholder of Purchaser and through its designees on
Purchasers Board of Directors), own, manage, operate, control, participate
in, acquire more than three percent of (or the right to acquire more than
three percent of) any class of voting securities of, perform services for, or
otherwise carry on, either a retail pharmacy business in the United States or
a pharmacy benefits management business in the

     

   

United States. Purchaser and Seller agree that $1 million of the cash
portion of the Final Purchase Price will be allocated to the covenant not to
compete set forth in this Section 4.15, and agree to act in accordance with
such allocation for all purposes, including in any relevant Tax Returns or
filings.

  

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach, or
threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 4.15 will be
inadequate and, accordingly, Seller covenants and agrees that Purchaser
shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have
at Law, be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and to
the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened
breach of such covenant, as may be available from any court of competent
jurisdiction. In addition, Seller and Purchaser agree that the terms of the
covenant in this Section 4.15 are fair and reasonable in light of Purchasers
plans for the Business and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of
the goodwill and other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event
that any of the covenants contained in this Section 4.15 shall be determined
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions shall not be deemed void,
and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by the court
and that said covenant contained in this Section 4.15 shall be amended in
accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed by the
parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced to
the full extent of its terms and conditions or if a court finds the scope of
the covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine the covenant so as to
comply with applicable Law.

  

Section 4.16 _Stockholders Meeting; Proxy Statement; By-Laws_.

  

(a) Purchaser shall, in accordance with applicable Law, Purchasers Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and Purchasers Amended and Restated By-Laws:

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, a preliminary proxy statement relating to the solicitation
of proxies from the stockholders of Purchaser for approval of the Stockholder

any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy statement
and cause a definitive proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be
mailed to Purchasers stockholders and (B) to solicit proxies from its
stockholders to obtain the requisite approval of the Stockholder Vote
Matters; and

     

   

(iii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Purchaser that stockholders vote in favor of the Stockholder
Vote Matters.

  

(b) Seller agrees that it will cooperate with and assist Purchaser, including
providing Purchaser promptly upon request with the information concerning
Seller and the Company required to be included in the Proxy Statement, which
information, at the time the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, at the
time the Proxy Statement is mailed to Purchaser stockholders and at the time
of the Special Meeting, as such information may be supplemented or amended as
of such time, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

and conditions described in the Financing Commitment, including

Purchaser in such definitive agreements that are within its control. If all
other conditions (including all conditions under the Financing Commitment
that are required to be satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature have to be satisfied at the
Closing) and Seller and Purchaser are prepared to close, Purchaser agrees
that if the Financing (other than the bridge facility) is not otherwise
available, it

     

   

will draw down from the bridge facility contemplated by the Financing
Commitment an amount not less than the amount needed to pay the Estimated
Cash Consideration, and shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary
to cause the Closing to occur no later than the Outside Date (as defined in

Company and the Company Subsidiaries and its and their representatives,
attorneys, independent auditors and advisors to provide, all reasonable

Seller, constituting the " _Letters of Credit_ ").  Purchaser shall obtain
from each beneficiary of a Letter of Credit a binding written release of
Seller under any Letter of Credit in effect as of the Closing by either (i)
using its reasonable best efforts to provide substitute letters of credit
with terms that are, as a whole, at least as favorable to the counterparty as

making such other arrangements to which the counterparty is entitled under
the applicable Contract.

(except to the extent any such representation and warranty speaks as of a
specific date, in which event such representation and warranty shall be true

Closing solely for purposes of Article VI until the later of July 31, 2008 or
18 months following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in Section 2.19 (Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA) and Section

to this Article VI with respect to a claimed breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant shall expire at the date of termination of the survival
period for such representation, warranty or covenant claimed to be breached
(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless on or prior to the Termination Date a

indemnification is sought. _Provided_ that an indemnification claim is
timely made, it may continue to be asserted beyond the Termination Date of
the representation and warranty to which such claim relates until the final
disposition of such claim.

     

   

Section 6.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Closing, except

indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and

"), as the case may be, from and against all Liabilities, demands, claims,
actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, interest, penalties and attorneys fees,
disbursements and expenses) (collectively, " _Damages_ ") asserted against,
resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee, directly
or indirectly: (i) resulting from or arising out of a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other obligation of Seller
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, each representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation being read for this purpose
without regard to any qualifications or limitations relating to materiality,
including the terms "material," "materially," "Company Material Adverse

and warranties exceeds $35,000,000 (the " _Seller Basket_ "). No individual
claim for Damages relating to breaches of representations and warranties of
$10,000 or less (each, a " _De Minimis Claim_ ") shall be aggregated for
purposes of either (x) determining whether the Seller Basket has been met or
(y) composing the portion of Damages that exceeds the Seller Basket, unless
such De Minimis Claim constitutes or is part of a series of two or more
related claims, in which case, such De Minimis Claims shall be aggregated for
purposes of determining whether the $10,000 threshold has been exceeded. In
the event the aggregate amount of the Damages sustained by the
Purchaser Indemnitees under clause (i) of this Section 6.2 with respect to
breaches of representations and warranties exceeds the Seller Basket, the
indemnification obligations of Seller shall apply only to those Damages
sustained by the Purchaser Indemnitees in excess of the Seller Basket.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Seller Basket nor the Seller Cap
shall apply to Damages resulting from breaches by Seller with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.2, Section 2.5, Section
2.6 and Section 2.29 of this Agreement, for all of which Damages Seller shall
be liable whether or not the Seller Basket has been exceeded. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Seller Basket nor the Seller Cap shall apply
to Damages for which Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
under clause (ii) of this Section 6.2, under Section 4.4 or under Article
VII.

  

Section 6.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. From and after the Closing,
except as set forth in Article VII with respect to Tax Matters, Purchaser
shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ "), as the case may be, from and against all Damages asserted
against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee,
directly or indirectly, resulting from or

     

   

arising out of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or other obligation of Purchaser contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement, each representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
being read for this purpose without regard to any qualifications or
limitations relating to materiality, including the terms "material,"
"materially," "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" or similar expressions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the aggregate liability of
Purchaser under this Section 6.3 exceed $450,000,000 (the " _Purchaser Cap_
"); and _provided_ , _further_ , that no claims for indemnification can be
made against Purchaser hereunder with respect to breaches of representations
and warranties unless and until the aggregate amount of such Damages for
which the Seller Indemnitees are entitled to indemnity under the terms hereof
with respect to breaches of representations and warranties exceeds
$35,000,000 (the " _Purchaser Basket_ "). No De Minimis Claim relating to
breaches of representations and warranties shall be aggregated for purposes
of either (x) determining whether the Purchaser Basket has been met or (y)
composing the portion of Damages that exceeds the Purchaser Basket, unless
such De Minimis Claim constitutes or is part of a series of two or more
related claims, in which case, such De Minimis Claims shall be aggregated for
purposes of determining whether the $10,000 threshold has been exceeded. In
the event the aggregate amount of the Damages sustained by the Seller
Indemnitees hereunder with respect to breaches of representations and
warranties exceeds the Purchaser Basket, the indemnification obligations of
Purchaser shall apply only to those Damages sustained by the Seller
Indemnitees in excess of the Purchaser Basket. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Purchaser Basket nor the Purchaser Cap shall apply to Damages
resulting from breaches by Purchaser with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.2, Section 3.4(d) and Section 3.9 of this
Agreement, for all of which Damages Purchaser shall be liable whether or not
the Purchaser Basket has been exceeded.

  

Section 6.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under this Article VI in respect of a claim
made against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a party to
this Agreement (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must
notify the indemnifying party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in
writing of the Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such
Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that failure to give such notification (or to provide any of the notices
or documents contemplated by the next sentence) shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim, other than those notices
and documents separately addressed to the Indemnifying Party.

  

(b) Subject to the provisions related to settlement of Third Party Claims set
forth in Section 6.4(c) below, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party
Claim, other than a Third-Party Claim which seeks an order, injunction, or
other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related
claim for money damages (which

     

   

Third-Party Claim shall be controlled at all times by the Company or
Purchaser) which relates to any Damages indemnified against hereunder and to
select counsel of its choice. If the Indemnifying Party does not, within
twenty-one days of its receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to
Section 6.4(a), elect to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Damages indemnified against
hereunder, the applicable Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim. If the applicable
Indemnified Party defends any Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall promptly reimburse the applicable Indemnified Party for the reasonable
costs and expenses of defending such Third-Party Claim upon submission of
periodic bills therefor. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Party may participate, at its
own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_
, that such applicable Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the applicable Indemnified Party, a
conflict or potential conflict exists between the applicable Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation
advisable; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Third-Party Claim.

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause the applicable
Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the other
party shall (and shall cause the applicable Indemnified Parties to) agree to
any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that (i) by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party (or its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of the
liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not require
any payment, admission or other action by, or limitation on, any Indemnified
Party, and (iii) releases all Indemnified Parties in connection with such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense
of a Third-Party Claim or in the event of a Third Party Claim relating to or
involving a supplier, the applicable Indemnified Parties shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this Article VI that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware of
the same. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to such Indemnified Party under this Article VI, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party has been actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure.

  

Section 6.5 _Calculation of Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in no event shall Seller or Purchaser be liable for
diminution of value or punitive, consequential, indirect, incidental or
special damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the form of action
through which such damages are sought unless such damages are actually
recovered or recovered by a third party in a Third Party Claim.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing,

     

   

the amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VI shall be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by the
Indemnified Party under any Contracts or applicable insurance policies with
respect to such Damages. To the extent an Indemnified Party recognizes any
net Tax Benefits (as defined immediately below) as a result of any
Damages for which indemnity is paid under this Article VI, the Indemnified
Party shall pay the amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in excess of the
indemnification payments received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such Damages) to the Indemnifying Party within 60 days of such Tax Benefits
being recognized by the Indemnified Party (to the extent such Tax Benefits
are realized prior to the payment of the indemnity for the Damages, the
amount of the indemnity for the Damages shall be reduced by the amount of Tax
Benefits actually realized). For this purpose, the Indemnified Party shall
be deemed to recognize a tax benefit (" _Tax Benefit_ ") with respect to a
taxable year only if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified Partys
liability for cash Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by excluding any
Tax items attributed to the Damages, exceeds the Indemnified Partys
actual liability for cash Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by taking
into account any Tax items attributed to (i) the Damages or (ii) the receipt
of any indemnification payments.

  

Section 6.6 _No Duplications_. Any liability for indemnification
hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of
more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

Section 6.7 _Treatment of Indemnification Amounts_. Any amounts payable
under this Article VI shall be, to the extent permitted by Law, an adjustment
to the Final Purchase Price.

  

 **ARTICLE VII** 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  

Section 7.1 _Tax Indemnity_.

  

(a) Subject to Purchasers compliance with the provisions of Section 7.3,
Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser Indemnitees harmless from and
against all Damages that Purchaser Indemnitees incur arising from, out of or
related to (without duplication):

  

(i) (A) Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing
Periods (as defined in Section 7.3 below) and, with respect to any Straddle
Period (as defined in Section 7.3 below), the portion of such Taxes for such
Straddle Period allocated to the Pre-Closing Portion (as defined in Section
7.4(b) below) pursuant to Section 7.4; (B) any Taxes for any Pre-Closing
Periods, resulting from, arising out of, relating to or caused by any
liability or obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for Taxes of
any person other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary (I) under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any predecessor or successor
provisions thereof and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law)
and (II) as a transferee or successor by Contract, assumption transferee
liability, operation of Law or otherwise; and (C) any Taxes resulting from,
arising out of, relating to or caused by the Reorganization.

     

   

(ii) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in Section 2.8 (in so much as such Section relates to Taxes) and
Section 2.18 (collectively, the " _Tax Representations_ "), disregarding,
solely for purposes of measuring the Damages as a result of the breach of
such representation or warranty under this Section 7.1(a)(ii), any
"material" qualifier therein;

  

(iii) Sellers share of Transfer Taxes (as defined in Section 7.2 below), as
determined under Section 7.2; and

  

(iv) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in Section
4.1(o), Section 4.3(a), and this Article VII;

  

but only to the extent such Damages in the aggregate exceed the aggregate
amount of current Taxes reflected in the Closing Working Capital. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that (x) no deferred Tax
items (whether assets or liabilities) and (y) no income or franchise Taxes
(whether current or deferred) shall be taken into account in calculating
Working Capital or Closing Working Capital as defined in this Agreement.

  

(b) Payments pursuant to this Article VII that are not made on the date
prescribed in this Article VII or, if no date is prescribed, the date that is
within 15 days after demand for payment is made (the " _Payment Period_ "),
shall bear interest for the period from and including the date immediately
following the last date of the Payment Period through and including the date
of payment at the Applicable Rate. Such interest will be payable at the same
time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days for which due.

  

Section 7.2 _Transfer Taxes_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all transfer,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement plus any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs associated with the preparing and filing of related Tax Returns
(collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty percent by
Purchaser and fifty percent by Seller.

  

(b) Seller and Purchaser (on its own behalf and with respect to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries) shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared
and filed), in consultation with Seller and its advisors, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by it in respect of Transfer Taxes, and shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to the applicable Tax Authorities the Transfer Taxes shown
to be due and payable on such Tax Returns. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns, and shall pay to
the other their share of such Taxes consistent with Section 7.2(a).

  

Section 7.3 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_. To
the extent not filed prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare (or
cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or

     

   

before the Closing Date (including the consolidated Federal income Tax of the
affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code) of which
the Company is the common parent and any similar state or local Tax Returns)
(each such period, a " _Pre-Closing Period_ " and such Tax Returns, the "
_Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ ") and for any taxable period beginning on or
before and ending after the Closing Date (each such period, a " _Straddle
Period_ " and such Tax Returns, the " _Straddle Tax Returns_ "). All Pre-
Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent in all
material respects with the prior practice of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, except as required by applicable Law.  With respect to any Tax
Return to be filed by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.3, no later than
45 days prior to the due date (taking into account any valid extensions
thereof) (" _Due Date_ ") for the filing of such Tax Return, Purchaser shall
submit, or cause to be submitted, a draft of such Tax Return to Seller for
its review, including, in the case of any Straddle Tax Return, calculations
of the Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to Section 7.4. Within 20 days
following Sellers receipt of the draft of such Tax Return, Seller shall have
the right reasonably to object by written notice to Purchaser to the
information contained in such Tax Return and calculations. If Seller does
not so object within such time period, such Tax Return and calculations shall
be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive,
for purposes of this Section 7.3.  If Seller objects to such Tax Return and
calculations, it shall notify Purchaser of such disputed item (or items) and
the basis of its objection in reasonable detail (in such written notice), and
Purchaser and Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute as
promptly as practicable. If Purchaser and Seller cannot reach agreement
regarding such dispute, the dispute shall be presented to the Accountants
selected in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 1.4(c), whose
determination that Sellers position is "more likely than not" to prevail
shall bind both Purchaser and Seller (and Sellers position shall be used if
it "is more likely than not" to prevail; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser and Seller shall require the Accountants to make a
determination that Sellers position "is more likely than not" to prevail
within 10 days but in no event later than 5 days prior to the Due Date for
the filing of such Tax Return. No later than 3 days prior to the Due Date of
any Tax Return to be filed by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.3, Seller
shall pay to Purchaser, in immediately available funds, that amount of the
total liability for Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Tax Return
allocated to Seller pursuant to Section 7.4 as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 7.3. Subject to the immediately preceding two sentences,
Purchaser shall cause the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary (as the
case may be) to timely and duly file such Pre-Closing or Straddle Tax Return
and to timely pay to the applicable Tax Authority an amount equal to the
total liability for Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Tax Return.
Seller shall be responsible for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of Purchaser Indemnitees incurred in connection with the preparation
and filing of all Pre-Closing or Straddle Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_
, that all costs and expenses of the Accountants shall be paid fifty percent
by Purchaser and fifty percent by Seller.

  

Section 7.4 _Allocation of Taxes_.

  

(a) The parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
elect with the relevant Tax Authority for all Tax purposes to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Where not so permitted, the portion of any Taxes that
are allocable to the Pre-Closing Portion of the Straddle Period shall be
either (x) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (without
regard to net income), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes of the entire
period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, such as
real property Taxes, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Pre-Closing Portion of the Straddle Period and
the denominator of which is the number or calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period or (y) in all other cases, deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the taxable period ended on and included the Closing
Date. Any deferred items taken into income pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.1502-13 (or any predecessor or successor provisions thereof) and
any excess loss accounts taken into income under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-19 (or any predecessor or successor provisions thereof) as a result of
this transaction shall for these purposes be allocated to the Pre-Closing
Period.

   

63   

 

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Pre-Closing Portion_ " means, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period that
begins on the first day of such Straddle Period and ends on, and includes,
the Closing Date.

  

Section 7.5 _Tax Refunds_. Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to apply for and obtain Tax Refunds (as defined below in
this Section 7.5) to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries may
be entitled and to which Seller is entitled to payment of pursuant to this
Section 7.5, unless Purchaser reasonably determines  that any of the
Purchaser Indemnitees would be adversely affected by applying for or
obtaining any such Tax Refund; _provided_ that if Seller objects to such
determination by Purchaser that any of the Purchaser Indemnitees would be
adversely affected by applying for or obtaining any such Tax Refund, Seller
may submit the disagreement regarding whether any Purchaser Indemnitee would
be adversely affected to the Accountants (as provided in Section 7.3) and
such disagreement shall be deemed to be a dispute regarding the preparation
of filing of a Tax Return, using the procedure set forth in Section 7.3 for
the resolution of such dispute.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
shall not be obligated to pursue any Tax Refund pursuant to this Section 7.5
on behalf of Seller if Purchaser reasonably determines that the cost of
applying for and obtaining such Tax Refund exceeds the amount of such Tax
Refund, unless Seller pays to Purchaser in advance amounts sufficient to
cover such shortfall. Subject to Section 7.6, Purchaser shall pay or cause to
be paid to Seller all Tax Refunds that are actually received by the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (within 10 days of the
actual receipt of such refund) for (i) a Pre-Closing Period and (ii)
a portion of all Tax Refunds paid by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
for any Straddle Period (such portion to be allocated consistent with
the principles set forth in Section 7.4), in each case, net of (x) any Taxes
(or increase in Taxes) imposed upon or attributable to such Tax Refund and
(y) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Purchaser Indemnitees
incurred in connection with applying for and obtaining such Tax Refund and
except to the extent such Tax Refund in (i) and (ii) are reflected on the
Closing Working Capital Statement (in which case, such Tax Refund and the
related out-of-pocket costs and expenses shall be for Purchasers account).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller
shall not be entitled to any Tax Refund with respect to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries which relates to a carryback of a Tax attribute
(including net operating losses and net capital losses) generated in any
Taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. For this purpose, a " _Tax
Refund_ " shall mean any refund, rebate, abatement, reduction or other
recovery (whether directly or indirectly through a right of setoff or credit)
of Taxes (including payments of estimated Taxes) of the Company, the
Subsidiaries and their Affiliates and any interest received thereon with
respect to any Pre-Closing Periods and the Pre-Closing Portion of any
Straddle Period.

     

   

Section 7.6 _Assistance and Cooperation_.

  

(a) After the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall (i) reasonably assist (and
cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably assist) the other party in
preparing and filing any Tax Returns that such other party is responsible for
preparing, (ii) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes or other proceedings with any Tax Authority or with respect to any
matters with respect to, Taxes of or relating to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries and (iii) make available to the other party and to any Tax
Authority as reasonably requested all information, records, and documents
relating to Tax matters of or relating to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. In addition, Seller and Purchaser shall make themselves (and
their respective employees) reasonably available, on a mutually convenient
basis, to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under
this Section 7.6. Each party shall keep any information obtained under this
Section 7.6 confidential except (x) as may be necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or the conduct of any Tax Proceeding or (y) with
the consent of the other party.

  

(b) Seller and Purchaser will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers and all material records (whether paper, electronic or other format)
or other documents or electronic data in its possession (or in the possession
of their respective Affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing and Straddle Periods
until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, taking
into account all extensions thereof, or (ii) six years following the Due Date
for such Tax Returns. After such time, before Seller or Purchaser dispose of
any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its respective
Affiliates), the other party shall be given the opportunity, after 30 days
prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents
as such other party may select (at such other partys expense).

  

Section 7.7 _Tax Claims_.

  

(a) If any audit, assessment, suit, proposed adjustment, deficiency,
dispute, administrative or judicial proceeding or similar claim is commenced,
proposed or made by any Tax Authority that, if successful, would result
in indemnification of Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 7.1 (a "
_Tax Claim_ "), then Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and transmit to
Seller a written notice describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Tax
Claim and all related information in connection with such Tax Claim. Failure
to promptly provide such notice shall not affect the right of Purchaser
Indemnitees to indemnification hereunder, except and only to the extent
Seller is materially prejudiced by such delay or omission. Seller shall
notify Purchaser that Seller elects to control the Tax Claim at its own cost
and expense in all appropriate Tax Proceedings.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 7.7, if either (i) Seller (A) fails to
properly notify Purchaser that Seller elects to control the Tax Claim
pursuant to the preceding sentence, or (B) after commencing or undertaking
any such defense or settlement, fails reasonably to prosecute or withdraw
from such defense or settlement or (ii) the Tax Claim involves a Straddle
Period, then Purchaser shall have the right to control the

     

   

Tax Claim in all appropriate Tax Proceedings and Purchaser Indemnitees shall
have the right to be reimbursed by Seller for their reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses relating to the control of the Tax Claim; _provided_
that with respect to any portion of a Tax Claim that relates to a Straddle
Period, Seller shall be required to reimburse Purchaser Indemnitees only for
their pro rata share of such reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses. The
party controlling the Tax Claim pursuant to this Section 7.7(a) is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Controlling Party_."

  

(b) The Controlling Party shall defend the Tax Claim in good faith with
counsel of its own choosing (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
other party) and have full control of such defense and proceedings, including
any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ that the Controlling Party
shall not enter into any settlement agreement or otherwise dispose of such
Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  The other party
shall have the right with the prior written consent of the Controlling Party,
not to be unreasonably withheld, to attend meetings, participate in hearings
or proceedings and review and comment on any documents prior to their
submission that relate to any defense or settlement of any Tax
Claim controlled by the Controlling Party and shall bear its own costs and
expenses of such participation.

  

Section 7.8 _Scope_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, this Article VII shall be the exclusive remedy for any
Damages relating or attributable to Taxes.

  

(a) The Tax Representations shall survive until 15 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking into account all
extensions thereof), if any. All covenants and agreements of the parties
contained or referred to in Section 4.1(o) and this Article VII shall survive
the Closing and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. In the event of a conflict between this Article VII and any other
provision of this Agreement (including Article VI), this Article VII shall
govern and control.

  

(b) The period of time that a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
survives the Closing pursuant to Section 7.8(a) shall be the " _Tax Survival
Period_ " with respect to such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. In the event notice of any claim for indemnification shall have
been given within the applicable Tax Survival Period and such claim has not
been finally resolved by the expiration of such Tax Survival Period, the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements that are the subject of
such claim shall survive, solely for purposes of such claim, until such claim
is finally resolved.  For purposes of any indemnification under Section
7.1(a)(ii), the Tax Representations shall be deemed to be made at signing and
at and as of the Closing.

  

(c) Any amounts payable under this Article VII shall be, to the extent
permitted by Law, an adjustment to the Unadjusted Cash Consideration.

  

Section 7.9 _Certain Tax Sharing Agreements_. As of the Closing, all
agreements with respect to the sharing or allocation of, or indemnification
for, Taxes or similar contract or arrangement, whether written or unwritten
(" _Tax Sharing Agreements_ "), to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party to or the subject of shall be terminated

     

   

and, after the Closing, none of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall have further rights or obligations under such Tax Sharing
Agreements.

  

Section 7.10 _Recognition of Net Tax Benefits_. To the extent an Indemnified
Party recognizes any net Tax Benefits as a result of any Damages for which
indemnity is paid under this Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall pay the
amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in excess of the indemnification
payments received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Damages)
to the Indemnifying Party within 60 days of such Tax Benefits being
recognized by the Indemnified Party (to the extent such Tax Benefits are
realized prior to the payment of the indemnity for the Damages, the amount of
the indemnity for the Damages shall be reduced by the amount of Tax Benefits
actually realized). For this purpose, Tax Benefit shall have the meaning set
forth in Section 6.5.

  

 **ARTICLE VIII** 
  
 TERMINATION

  

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing as follows:

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

  

(b) by Seller or Purchaser, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the date that is nine months following the date hereof; _provided_
that if, as of such date, the waiting period, and any extensions thereof,
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the
HSR Act shall have not expired or been terminated or there is a pending
action by any Governmental Authority seeking to prohibit Purchasers
ownership of JCG LLC or the Company or the operation of all or substantially
all of Purchasers or the Companys and any of their respective Subsidiaries
businesses or assets, then either Seller or Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion, extend such date for an additional three months (such date, as
extended, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date;

the transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable;

nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or
the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.
No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be
held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance.

Seller Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, together with the
several agreements and other documents and instruments referred to herein or

effect.

  

Section 9.4 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that

claim under or by reason of their Agreement or any part hereof. This
Agreement may not be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and any purported assignment or

the parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement
each acknowledge that, in view of the uniqueness of the Business and
the transactions contemplated hereby, each party would not have an adequate
remedy at law for money damages in the event that the covenants to be

terms, and therefore agree that the other parties shall be entitled to
specific enforcement of the terms hereof and any other equitable remedy to
which such parties may be entitled.

CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES THEREOF.

  

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

(a) Each party to this Agreement, by its execution hereof, hereby:

  

(i) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware, for the purpose of any and all
actions, suits or proceedings arising in whole or in part out of, related to,
based upon or in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter hereof;

  

(ii) waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that any such action brought in one of the above-named courts
should be dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens, should be transferred
to any court other than one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by
reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other than
one of the above-named courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof may not be enforced in or by such court, and

  

(iii) agrees not to commence any such action other than before one of the
above-named courts nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or
intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action to any court
other than one of the above-named courts whether on the grounds of forum non
conveniens or otherwise.

     

   

(b) Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally designates, appoints, and
empowers The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange
Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, as its designee, appointee and agent to
receive, accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf service of any and all
legal process, summons, notices and documents that may be served in any
action, suit or proceeding brought against Seller in any such United States
federal or state court with respect to its obligations, liabilities or any
other matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and that may
be made on such designee, appointee and agent in accordance with legal
procedures prescribed for such courts. If for any reason such designee,
appointee and agent hereunder shall cease to be available to act as such,
Seller agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in the State
of Delaware on the terms and for the purposes of this Section 9.10 reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser. Seller further hereby irrevocably consents and
agrees to the service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and
documents in any such action, suit or proceeding against Seller by serving a
copy thereof upon the relevant agent for service of process referred to in
this Section 9.10 (whether or not the appointment of such agent shall for any
reason prove to be ineffective or such agent shall accept or acknowledge such
service) or by sending copies thereof by a recognized next day courier
service to Seller at its address specified in or designated pursuant to this
Agreement.  Seller agrees that the failure of any such designee, appointee
and agent to give any notice of such service to them shall not impair or
affect in any way the validity of such service or any judgment rendered in
any action or proceeding based thereon.
