 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April
26, 2013, is made by and among Actient Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Company_ "), Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Purchaser_ "), Opal Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the "
_Merger Sub_ "), GTCR Fund IX/B, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "
_Blocker Seller_ "), and GTCR Fund IX/A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership,
solely in its capacity as representative (the " _Representative_ ") for the
Blocker Seller and the Companys Unitholders and Optionholders (all of whom
are listed on the attached _Sellers Schedule_ , collectively, the " _Sellers_
"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings
set forth in _Article IX_ below.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to acquire 100% of the membership interests of
the Company through (i) the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock (the " _Shares_ ") of GTCR/Actient Holdings/B Corp., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Blocker Corp_ "), an entity that, immediately
prior to the Closing, owned certain membership interests of the Company, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the " _Stock
Purchase_ ") and (ii) a reverse subsidiary merger transaction pursuant to
which the Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser and the Blocker Corp,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the " _Merger_ "
and, together with the Stock Purchase, the " _Transaction_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors or managers (or the equivalent
governing bodies) of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub, the Blocker Seller and the
Company have approved this Agreement, the Merger and/or the Stock Purchase (as
applicable) and the related transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS, simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
parties hereto have entered into that certain Escrow Agreement with the Escrow
Agent, pursuant to which the Escrow Amount and the Management Holdback Escrow
will be deposited with the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account and the
Management Holdback Escrow Account, respectively.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _THE MERGER AND THE STOCK PURCHASE_

 



 

1.01 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company in
accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (as amended, "
_Delaware LLC Law_ "),

 



      
 

 



 

whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall be the surviving limited liability company (the " _Surviving Company_ ")
and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser and the Blocker Corp.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause a certificate
of merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings
required by Delaware LLC Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the Delaware LLC Law or at such later time as the Purchaser
and the Company mutually agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to
all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company
and the Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware LLC Law.

 



 

1.02 _Conversion of Units._

 



 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any party:

 



 

(a) Each Unit (and the membership interests represented thereby) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any Units
(and the membership interests represented thereby) which are held by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the Company or by
the Purchaser or the Merger Sub, all of which shall cease to be outstanding
and be canceled and none of which shall receive any payment with respect
thereto, and (ii) any Units (and the membership interests represented thereby)
which are held by the Blocker Corp, all of which shall be converted, without
Blocker Corp receiving any payment with respect thereto, into common units in
the Surviving Company with a fair market value equal to the fair market value
of such Units held by the Blocker Corp, as such common units are provided for
by the Surviving Company LLC Agreement) and all rights in respect thereof
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, forthwith cease to exist and be converted into and represent
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration attributable to such
Unit plus any Additional Merger Consideration attributable to such Unit.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, twenty-five percent (25%) of
the Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration plus twenty-five
percent (25%) of any Additional Merger Consideration payable by the Purchaser
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the Units set
forth on the _Management Holdback Schedule_ (less the purchase price paid by
such Unitholder for such Units, which amount is also set forth on such
Schedule) shall, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement be
placed into the Management Holdback Escrow Account (the " _Management Holdback
Escrow_ "), at the Purchasers expense, and such portion of the Management
Holdback Escrow attributable to each such Unitholder, together with any
earnings thereon, shall be released, and the Purchaser shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to release, (i) to such Unitholder, on the earlier of (x) the
date set forth

 



      
 

 



 

on the _Management Holdback Schedule_ with respect to such Unitholder, if he
or she is employed by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as of such date
and (y) the date on which the employment of such Unitholder is terminated (1)
by his or her employer, if such termination is without "cause" (as defined in
the agreement evidencing the award of such Unit), (2) by such Unitholder for
"good reason" (as defined in the agreement evidencing the award of such Unit)
or (3) due to death or disability of such Unitholder or (ii) to the Paying
Agent, on the date set forth on the _Management Holdback Schedule_ with
respect to such Unitholder, if such Unitholder is not employed by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as of such date and the termination of such
Unitholders employment was not as a result of any of the circumstances set
forth in _clause (y)_ above. Any amounts placed in the Management Holdback
Escrow Account that are distributed to the Paying Agent pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence (i) except as otherwise contemplated by _clause
(ii)_ below, shall be treated as Additional Merger Consideration for all
purposes hereunder and (ii) shall be distributed to the holders of Common
Units set forth on the _MH Release Distribution Schedule_ pro rata based on
the percentages set forth opposite the name of each Person on such schedule;
_provided_ , that any Common Units held by the Blocker Corp immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be deemed to have been held by the Blocker Seller
for this purpose.

 



 

(b) Each membership interest of the Merger Sub (a " _Merger Sub Interest_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into common units in the Surviving Company, as such common units are
provided for by the Surviving Company LLC Agreement. As of the Effective Time,
the Merger Sub Interests shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holder or holders
of such membership interests shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive common units in the Surviving Company to
be issued in consideration therefor as provided herein, without interest. As
of the Effective Time, the Purchaser and the Blocker Corp shall be the holders
of all the issued and outstanding units of the Surviving Company.

 



 

1.03 _Merger Consideration._

 



 

(a) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Representative prepared and
delivered to the Purchaser a written statement (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_
"), signed and reviewed by the chief financial officer of the Company, setting
forth its good faith calculation of its estimate of (i) Cash (the " _Estimated
Cash_ "), (ii) Indebtedness as of the open of business on the Closing Date
(the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Net Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ ") and (iv) Transaction Expenses (the "
_Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ").

 



 

(b) The Pre-Closing Statement has been prepared and Estimated Cash, Estimated
Indebtedness, Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Transaction Expenses
have been determined on a consolidated basis, in accordance with the terms of
_Section 2.01_ regarding the preparation of the Preliminary Statement.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Closing Merger Consideration_
" means (i) $585,000,000 (the " _Base Consideration_ "), _minus_ (ii) the
amount of the Estimated Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by
which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount

 



      
 

 



 

exceeds the Target Net Working Capital Amount, _minus_ (iv) the amount, if
any, by which the Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount, _minus_ (v) the Escrow Amount, _plus_ (vi) the amount
of Estimated Cash if the amount of Estimated Cash is positive, _minus_ (vii)
the amount by which zero (0) exceeds the amount of Estimated Cash if the
amount of Estimated Cash is negative, _minus_ (viii) the amount of the
Estimated Transaction Expenses, _plus_ (ix) the aggregate exercise price of
the Options that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt, excluding any adjustments pursuant to _clauses (ii)_,
_(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ and _(viii)_ of the prior sentence, the
sum of (x) the aggregate consideration that the Purchaser and the Company
shall be obligated to pay to the Unitholders and the Optionholders pursuant to
_Section 3.02(b)_ and _clause (i)_ of _Section 1.05(a) plus_ (y) the Escrow
Amount shall be an amount equal to the Base Consideration.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Final Merger Consideration_ "
means (i) the Base Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the amount of Indebtedness as
finally determined pursuant to _Article II_, _plus_ (iii) the amount, if any,
by which the Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Article
II_ exceeds the Target Net Working Capital Amount, _minus_ (iv) the amount, if
any, by which the Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Net Working
Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Article II_, _minus_ (v) the
Escrow Amount, _plus_ (vi) the amount of Cash as finally determined pursuant
to _Article II_ if such amount of Cash is positive, _minus_ (vii) the amount
of Cash as finally determined pursuant to _Article II_ if such amount of Cash
is negative, _minus_ (viii) the amount of Transaction Expenses as finally
determined pursuant to _Article II_, _plus_ (ix) the aggregate exercise price
of the Options that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

1.04 _Unit Exchange_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall cause a paying agent mutually appointed by the
Purchaser and the Representative (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to effect the
exchange of cash for Units which are entitled to payment pursuant to _Section
1.02_. After the Effective Time, each Unitholder who has surrendered his, her
or its Units pursuant to a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (each, a " _Letter
of Transmittal_ "), to the Paying Agent, shall be entitled to receive from the
Paying Agent in exchange therefor the portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration into which such Unitholders Units shall have been converted as
a result of the Merger as determined pursuant to _Section 1.02_ and
thereafter, as and when any Additional Merger Consideration is payable in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, such
Unitholder shall be entitled to be paid the Additional Merger Consideration
into which such Unitholders Units shall have been converted as a result of
the Merger as determined pursuant to _Section 1.02_. Surrendered Units shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Unit
shall represent solely the right to receive the Allocable Portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration and any Additional Merger Consideration into
which it was converted pursuant to _Section 1.02_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any certificate representing such Units shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the
Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, at the
request of the Purchaser, the execution of an indemnification agreement with
respect to such certificate in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser, the Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration and

 



       
 

 



 

any Additional Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Units
represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this _Article_ I. For all
purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any and all amounts paid by the Purchaser to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the Sellers or the Representative hereunder shall be
deemed to have been paid to the Sellers or the Representative, as the case may
be, and in no event shall the Purchaser have any further obligation or
liability to any Seller or the Representative in respect thereof unless such
amounts have been delivered to the Purchaser or the Surviving Company pursuant
to _Section 1.04(b)_.

 



 

(b) If and to the extent any Unitholder fails to deliver a Letter of
Transmittal to the Paying Agent prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, any funds received by the Paying Agent as Closing Merger
Consideration or Additional Merger Consideration and payable to such
Unitholder in respect of such Unitholders Units shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company (and
any such cash may be commingled with the general funds of the Purchaser or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be), free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto (other than the claims of a
Seller and its heirs, assigns and transferees hereunder) and shall be promptly
delivered to the Surviving Company by the Paying Agent, and such Unitholder
shall look only to the Purchaser and the Surviving Company for payment of such
amounts. Each Unitholder who prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date delivers to the Paying Agent a duly completed and executed Letter
of Transmittal shall look only to the Paying Agent for satisfaction of any
claims related to the Closing Merger Consideration or Additional Merger
Consideration (except to the extent the Paying Agent has returned such funds
to the Surviving Company as contemplated above, in which case such Unitholder
shall only look to the Purchaser and the Surviving Company as contemplated
above). Any interest, dividends or other income earned on the investment of
cash held by the Paying Agent, together with all tax and other liabilities
associated therewith, shall be for the account of the Surviving Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, the Purchaser or the
Surviving Company will be liable to any Unitholder for any Closing Merger
Consideration or Additional Merger Consideration if delivered to a public
official if required pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar applicable Law.

(a) The Company shall, as of the Effective Time, cause all Options, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, to be canceled and extinguished, no longer be

respect to each Option: (i) reasonably promptly following the Effective Time
an amount in cash, without interest and subject to withholding pursuant to
_Section 3.03_ below, equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the
Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration attributable to each
Unit that is subject to such Option over the exercise price per Common Unit
payable upon exercise of such Option, _multiplied_ by (B) the number of Common
Units that would be issued upon exercise of such Option if such holder had
exercised such Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time
(regardless of whether or not the Optionholder actually had the right to
exercise such Option) (the " _Closing Option Consideration_ "), and (ii) any

the Common Units underlying such Option to the extent payable in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

received by the Sellers pursuant to _Article I_ in an amount equal to
$2,000,000 (such initial deposit, as it may be increased or decreased at any
time in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Representative Holdback Amount_
") shall be delivered by the Purchaser to the Representative at the Closing,
on behalf of the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
segregated account designated by the Representative (which account shall be
used only to hold the Representative Holdback Amount and to pay any fees,
costs and expenses of the Representative payable out of the Representative
Holdback Amount pursuant to the terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement). The portion of the Representative Holdback Amount delivered to,
and held by, the Representative on behalf of each such Seller shall be
determined pro rata based upon each Sellers Residual Percentage. The
Representative is entitled to pay on behalf of the Sellers, and to the extent
paid by the Representative from its own funds, obtain reimbursement for, any
fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Representative in the performance of
its duties hereunder (" _Representative Expenses_ ") from the Representative
Holdback Amount, and the Representative shall not use any portion of the
Representative Holdback Amount for any other purpose. For all purposes of this
Agreement, any and all amounts paid by the Purchaser to the Representative
pursuant to this _Section 1.08_ or otherwise in respect of the Representative
Holdback Amount shall be deemed to have been paid to the Unitholders and the
holders of Options and in no event shall the Purchaser have any further
obligation or liability to any Unitholder or holder of Options in respect
thereof.

 



 

1.09 _No Dissenter s Rights or Appraisal Rights_. No holder of Units or
Options shall be entitled to any "dissenters rights," "appraisal rights" or
any similar remedies under Delaware LLC Law or any other applicable law.
Following the Effective Time, each holder of any Units and/or Options shall be

this Agreement.

Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration attributable to the

such amount that such Units are outstanding at the Effective Time).
Additionally, to the extent the Sellers are entitled to receive any Additional
Merger Consideration, then the Blocker Seller shall be entitled to receive the
Blocker Sellers Residual Percentage of such Additional Merger Consideration
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT_

 



 

2.01 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will deliver to the Representative an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the open of business on the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement showing the calculation
of Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital derived from the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Transaction Expenses (together with the Closing Balance Sheet,

 



      
 

 



 

the " _Preliminary Statement_ "). In connection with its preparation of the
Preliminary Statement, the Purchaser and its accountants shall be permitted to
make reasonable inquiries of the Representative and its accountants regarding
questions or disagreements relating to the Pre-Closing Statement, and the
Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
accountants to reasonably cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. The
Preliminary Statement shall be prepared in accordance with (i) the accounting
methods, policies, categorizations, definitions, principles, asset recognition
bases, practices, techniques and procedures (including in respect of
managements exercise of judgment) that are specified in the calculation of
Net Working Capital as of March 31, 2013 set forth in _Exhibit D_ (which
amounts included in _Exhibit D_ are for illustrative purposes only); (ii) to
the extent not inconsistent with _clause (i)_, the accounting methods,
policies, categorizations, definitions, principles, assets recognition bases,
practices, techniques and procedures (including in respect of managements
exercise of judgment) adopted in connection with the latest balance sheet
included in the Audited Financial Statements; and (iii) to the extent not
inconsistent with _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ , GAAP, and shall not include any
changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital
shall be derived from the Closing Balance Sheet. The parties agree that the
purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining Cash,
Indebtedness and Net Working Capital and the related purchase price adjustment
contemplated by this _Section 2.01_ is to (i) measure the amount of Cash and
Indebtedness and (ii) measure changes in Net Working Capital against the
Target Net Working Capital Amount, and such processes are not intended to
permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies
for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet or determining Cash,
Indebtedness or Net Working Capital. The Representative and its accountants
and other representatives shall be permitted reasonable access during normal
business hours upon reasonable advance notice to review the Companys and its
Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers related to the preparation
of the Preliminary Statement and the adjustments contemplated hereby. The
Representative and its accountants and other representatives may make
reasonable inquires of the Purchaser, the Surviving Company and their
respective accountants regarding questions or disagreements, and the Purchaser
shall use its, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to
use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to
reasonably cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If the Representative
has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Representative shall
deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an
" _Objections Statement_ ") with reasonable supporting detail as to any such
disputed items. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser
within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the
Representative, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. If an Objections Statement is timely
delivered, the Representative and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any such objections set forth therein, but if they do not reach a
final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Representative and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to
Deloitte and Touche LLP or such other independent accountants of nationally
recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and the
Representative (who shall not have any material relationship with the
Purchaser or the Representative) (the " _Valuation Firm_ "). Any further
submissions to the Valuation Firm must be written and delivered to each party
to the dispute. The Valuation

 



      
 

 



 

Firm shall make a final determination of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital and Transaction Expenses, and the resulting Final Merger Consideration
calculated with reference to such amounts to the extent such amounts are in
dispute, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement and on _Exhibit E_. The parties will cooperate with the Valuation
Firm during the term of its engagement. If an Objections Statement is
delivered to the Valuation Firm for resolution, the determination of Cash,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses, and the resulting
Final Merger Consideration calculated with reference thereto, shall become
final and binding on the parties on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its
final resolution in writing to the parties.

 



 

2.02 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. If the Final Merger Consideration is
greater than the Closing Merger Consideration, the Purchaser shall promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the final determination
of the Final Merger Consideration) pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying
Agent for further payment to the Sellers, on a pro rata basis according to
each Sellers Residual Percentage, the amount of such excess (less any
applicable Management Holdback Escrow), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Paying Agent and
deposit with the Escrow Agent any amounts attributable to the Management
Holdback Escrow. If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Closing
Merger Consideration, the Representative and the Purchaser shall promptly (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of
the Final Merger Consideration) cause the Escrow Agent to pay on behalf of the
Sellers (on a pro rata basis according to each Sellers Residual Percentage)
to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account the absolute value of such difference
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated in writing by the Purchaser to the Escrow Agent. Other than in the
case of fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may only be asserted against
the Person(s) that committed such fraud), the Sellers and the Representative
shall not have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to _Section 2.01_
or this _Section 2.02_ except to the extent of the funds available from the
Escrow Account.

 



 

2.03 _Earn-Out_.

 



 

(a) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this _Section 2.03_,
including the review and dispute procedures set forth herein, and solely to
the extent required by this _Section 2.03_, the Purchaser shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to the Paying Agent for further payment to the Sellers (on a pro
rata basis according to each Sellers Residual Percentage) an aggregate amount
equal to each Earn-Out Amount (if any) achieved in accordance with this
_Section 2.03_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser may be obligated,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this _Section 2.03_, to pay each of
the Earn-Out Amounts.

 



 

(b) _Base Earn-Out_. The Purchaser shall be obligated to pay an aggregate
amount equal to $15,000,000 (the " _Base Earn-Out Amount_ ") when cumulative
Net Sales of the Urology Products from and after the Closing first equal
$150,000,000.

 



 

(c) _Twelve-Month Earn-Out_. If Net Sales of the Urology Products for the
twelve-month period beginning on May 1, 2013 and ending on April 30, 2014
(such period, the " _Twelve-Month Earn-Out Period_ ") equal or exceed
$150,000,000, the Purchaser shall be

 



      
 

 



 

obligated to pay an aggregate amount equal to $10,000,000 (the " _Twelve-Month
Earn-Out Amount_ ").

 



 

(d) _Twenty-Four-Month Earn-Out_. If Net Sales of the Urology Products for the
twenty-four-month period beginning on May 1, 2013 and ending on April 30, 2015
(such period, the " _Twenty-Four-Month Earn-Out Period_ ") equal or exceed
$300,000,000, the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay an aggregate amount
equal to $25,000,000 (the " _Twenty-Four-Month Earn-Out Amount_ ").

 



 

(e) Subject to compliance with _Section 2.03(g)_, if Net Sales of the Urology
Products for the Twelve-Month Earn-Out Period or the Twenty-Four-Month Earn-
Out Period are less than $150,000,000 or $300,000,000, respectively, then the
Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Period shall be zero.

 



 

(f) Any calculation of Net Sales of the Urology Products for purposes of this
_Section 2.03_ shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and based upon the
Companys existing principles, practices, methodologies and policies as used
in the 2012 Audited Financial Statements (example calculations of Net Sales of
the Urology Products for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and the
three months ended March 31, 2013 are attached as _Exhibit F_ hereto) so long
as such principles, practices, methodologies and policies are in accordance
with GAAP. Such calculation is included for reference purposes only, and the
Company does not make any representation or warranty, and will not incur any
liability, in respect thereof.

 



 

(g) The Purchaser agrees that, commencing on the Closing Date and continuing
through the later of (x) April 30, 2015 and (y) the month-end of the month in
which the Base Earn-Out Amount is achieved, it will not, and will not permit
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action with the
intent of preventing the achievement of any Earn-Out Amount. In the event that
prior to April 30, 2015, the Purchaser disposes of the Surviving Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries
sell or otherwise dispose of any significant portion of their respective
assets (other than sales of assets in the Ordinary Course of Business), then
the contribution of such disposed assets to Net Sales of the Urology Products
for any Earn-Out Period ending after the disposition of such assets shall be
deemed to be an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Net Sales relating to such
disposed assets for the portion of any such Earn-Out Period ending on the
Divestiture Measurement Date and (y) an amount equal to the Net Sales relating
to such disposed assets for the period following the Divestiture Measurement
Date through the end of the applicable Earn-Out Period, calculated assuming
that such Net Sales would grow or contract at the same rate that such Net
Sales have grown or contracted, as the case may be, during the twelve-month
period ended on the month-end immediately prior to the Divestiture Measurement
Date. In the event that prior to the achievement of the Base Earn-Out Amount,
the Purchaser disposes of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries sell or otherwise dispose of
any significant portion of their respective assets (other than sales of assets
in the Ordinary Course of Business), then for purposes of determining when the
Base Earn-Out Amount is achieved, Net Sales of the Urology Products for each
calendar month following the Divestiture Measurement Date shall be deemed to
include an amount equal to the Net Sales relating to such disposed assets for
such calendar month, calculated assuming that such Net Sales would grow or
contract at the same rate that such Net Sales have grown or

 



      
 

 



 

contracted, as the case may be, during the twelve-month period ended on the
month-end immediately prior to the Divestiture Measurement Date.

 



 

(h) Not later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar
quarter during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
later of (i) April 30, 2015 and (ii) the month-end of the month in which the
Base Earn-Out Amount is achieved, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
the Representative a statement that sets forth in reasonable detail its
calculation of the Net Sales of the Urology Products, by Urology Product
(other than any Urology Products divested by the Purchaser, the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to such calendar quarter, which
divestitures, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include sales of Urology
Products in the Ordinary Course of Business), for each calendar month within
such calendar quarter (or portion thereof, as applicable). All amounts set
forth in any such statement, including the amount of any Net Sales, shall be
good faith estimates and shall not be final or binding on the parties. Until
the later of (i) ** ** April 30, 2015 and (ii) the month-end of the month in
which the Base Earn-Out Amount is achieved, as promptly as possible, but in
any event within thirty (30) days after April 30th of each year, the Purchaser
will deliver to the Representative a statement (a " _Preliminary Earn-Out
Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the Purchasers calculation
of the actual amount of Net Sales of the Urology Products for the twelve-month
period ended on April 30th of such year as determined in accordance with
_Section 2.03(f)_ and _Section 2.03(g)_. The Representative and its
accountants and other representatives shall be permitted reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to review the
Purchasers, the Surviving Companys and their respective Subsidiaries books
and records and any work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary
Earn-Out Statement. The Representative and its accountants and other
representatives may make reasonable inquires of the Purchaser, the Surviving
Company and their respective accountants regarding questions or disagreements
arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use
its, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to use their,
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to reasonably
cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If the Representative has any
objections to the Preliminary Earn-Out Statement, the Representative shall
deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an
" _Earn-Out Objections Statement_ ") with reasonable supporting detail as to
any such disputed items. If an Earn-Out Objections Statement is not delivered
to the Purchaser within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Preliminary Earn-
Out Statement to the Representative, such Preliminary Earn-Out Statement shall
be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. If an Earn-Out
Objections Statement is timely delivered, the Representative and the Purchaser
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections set forth
therein, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Earn-Out Objections Statement, the Representative
and the Purchaser shall submit such dispute to the Valuation Firm. Any further
submissions to the Valuation Firm must be written and delivered to each party
to the dispute. The Valuation Firm shall make a final determination of Net
Sales of the Urology Products for such period in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on _Exhibit E_
(applied _mutatis mutandis_ to this _Section 2.03_). The parties will
cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement. The
determination of Net Sales of the Urology Products calculated with reference
thereto, shall become final and binding on the parties on the date the
Valuation Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to the parties.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Within two (2) Business Days of the earlier to occur of (i) the delivery
by the Purchaser to the Representative of a quarterly Net Sales statement or a
Preliminary Earn-Out Statement showing the achievement of any Earn-Out Amount
and (ii) a final determination of Net Sales of the Urology Products pursuant
to _Section 2.03(h)_ resulting in the achievement of any Earn-Out Amount, the
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Sellers on a pro rata basis according to each Sellers
Residual Percentage an aggregate amount equal to the applicable Earn-Out
Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated in writing by the Paying Agent to the Purchaser. Subject
only to _Section 7.02(c)_, payment of the Earn-Out Amounts shall be absolute
and unconditional and shall not be subject to any set-off, counterclaim,
reduction or defense.

 



 

(j) All Earn-Out Amounts shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to _Article III_ hereof.

 



 

(k) The right of the Sellers to receive any Earn-Out Amount (i) is solely a
contractual right and is not a security for purposes of any federal or state
securities laws (and shall confer upon the Sellers only the rights of a
general unsecured creditor under applicable Law); (ii) will not be represented
by any form of certificate or instrument; (iii) does not give the Sellers any
dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, preemptive rights or other
rights common to holders of the Purchasers or the Surviving Companys equity
securities; and (iv) is not redeemable. The Representative hereby agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of any information delivered to it pursuant to
this _Section 2.03_, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, in which
case the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the Purchaser with advance notice of such requirement and a reasonable
opportunity to attempt to seek confidential treatment with respect to such
information.

reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to the books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying at
the Representatives expense) of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date as may be reasonably
necessary for (i) the Representative to prepare and file any Tax Returns or
other report or document with any Governmental Entity or (ii) any indemnity
claim pursuant to the indemnification provisions

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) except as necessary for a purpose described
in _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above, the Representative or its authorized
representatives maintain the confidentiality of any information delivered to
it pursuant to this _Section 6.01_, (c) nothing in this _Section 6.01_ shall
require the Purchaser to provide access to, or to disclose any information to,
the Representative if such access or disclosure would be in violation of
applicable Law or is unrelated to the purposes for which the Representative is
permitted access to such information pursuant to the terms of this sentence
and (d) nothing in this _Section 6.01_ shall require the Purchaser to provide
access to, or to disclose any information to, the Representative to the extent
that such information is subject to an attorney/client or work product
privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall, to the extent
that the same may be provided in a fashion consistent with the maintenance of
such privilege, make reasonable efforts to provide such information and
records reasonably required by the Representative or any of its
representatives. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Representative, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven (7) years following the
Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and
records of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing
Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Representative and
offering to surrender to the Representative such books and records or any
portion thereof which the Purchaser or the Surviving Company may intend to
destroy, alter or dispose of.

 



 

6.02 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the Companys or its Subsidiaries
certificate of formation, certification of incorporation, articles of
incorporation, operating agreement, bylaws, or equivalent governing documents
relating to the exculpation or indemnification (including fee advancement) of
any officers, managers and/or directors (unless required by Law) in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of
the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were officers,
managers and directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries, it being the intent
of the parties that such Persons shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification (including fee advancement) to the full extent
of the Law. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, honor and perform under all indemnification obligations owed
to any of the individuals who were officers, managers and/or directors of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) If the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) is to consolidate with or merges into any other
Person and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) is to transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.02_ The provisions of this _Section 6.02_ are
intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each current and
former officer, manager, director or similar functionary of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to,
and not in

 



       
 

 



 

substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have had by contract or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing Date) is made against any individuals who were officers, managers or
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date
or any other party covered by directors and officers liability insurance, on
or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this
_Section 6.02_ shall continue in effect solely with respect to any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation until the final disposition
of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



 

6.03 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) For a period of no less than twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date, the Purchaser will provide (or cause an Affiliate of the Purchaser to
provide) each employee who continues in employment with the Surviving Company
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or an hourly wage rate, as applicable,
that is no lower than the base salary or hourly wage rate provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) employee
benefits, including, without limitation, health, welfare, retirement and
severance benefits (other than equity-based awards), that are substantially
similar to those provided by the Company to such employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time or provided to similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 6.03_, the Purchaser shall have full discretion
with respect to bonuses to be paid to employees for fiscal year 2013 (subject
to any pre-existing contract arrangements binding on the Purchaser). The
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any obligations arising under
Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
defined in Treasury Regulation §54.4980B-9.

 



 

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, participation and, in
the case of vacation and severance programs only, benefit accrual under the
Purchasers and its Affiliates plans and programs providing employee benefits
(excluding any defined benefit pension plans) to Continuing Employees after
the Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company (and its
predecessors) prior to the Closing Date to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was (or would have been) entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit
for such service under Plans, except to the extent providing such credit would
result in any duplication of benefits. In addition, the Purchaser shall (or
shall cause an Affiliate of the Purchaser to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause: (i) each Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate,
without any waiting time (other than administrative delays expressly required
pursuant to the terms of an applicable Purchaser Benefit Plan), in any and all
Purchaser Benefit Plans; (ii) each Purchaser Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to provide that all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
Purchaser Benefit Plan are waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements
applied to the Continuing Employee under comparable Plans as of the Closing
Date), and (iii) each Purchaser Benefit Plan providing

 



      
 

 



 

medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to give effect,
in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, the Continuing
Employees during the plan year of the applicable Plan during which the Closing
occurs with respect to similar Purchaser Benefit Plans.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.03_ shall (i) subject to compliance
with the requirements of this _Section 6.03_, be construed to restrict in any
way the ability of the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates to (A) amend, terminate or modify the duties, responsibilities or
employment of any Continuing Employee, (B) to amend, terminate or modify any
Plan or Purchaser Benefit Plan, compensation or benefit arrangement or any
other employee benefit plans or programs maintained by the Purchaser, the
Surviving Company or their Affiliates at any time or from time to time, or (C)
grant any employee any special right for compensation, (ii) be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any compensation or benefit arrangement of
the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates, including any
Plan or Purchaser Benefit Plan, or (iii) be construed to create any third-
party beneficiary rights in any present or former employee, service provider,
independent contractor, consultant, any such Persons alternate payees,
dependents or beneficiaries or any other Person.

 



 

ARTICLE VII

 



 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

7.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions_. Except to the extent a different period is expressly set forth
herein, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the Applicable
Limitation Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Applicable

_Section 4.16_ (Compliance with Laws), _Section 4.17_ (FDA Regulatory
Compliance), _Section 4.18_ (United States Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Law

agreements set forth in _Article VII_ (other than _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ as it

7.02_, _Section 7.03_ and/or _Section 8.03_ shall not terminate (and shall
expressly survive until the final resolution thereof, notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary) with respect to any claim in respect of
which the Person to be indemnified shall have given notice to the indemnifying
party in accordance with this _Article VII_ before the termination of the
Applicable Limitation Date.

 



      
 

 



 

7.02 _Indemnification from the Escrow Account for the Benefit of the Purchaser
Parties_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article
VII_ and the Escrow Agreement), the Purchaser, on behalf of the Purchaser
Parties, shall be entitled to assert, as the Purchaser Parties sole and
exclusive remedy for any action relating (directly or indirectly) to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than with respect to
claims for fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may only be asserted against
the Person(s) that committed such fraud), and only in accordance with the
terms of this _Article VII_ and the Escrow Agreement, claims against the
Escrow Account and the Earn-Out Amounts in respect of any Losses that the
Purchaser Parties determined in good faith may be suffered or incurred by the
Purchaser Parties or any of them to the extent arising or resulting from:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein by the
Company, the Representative or the Sellers or in any Exhibit, Schedule or
certificate delivered hereunder (it being understood and agreed that the
existence of any such breach of any representation or warranty referred to in
this _clause (i)_ (other than the first sentence of _Section 4.06_) and any
resulting Losses shall be determined without regard to any qualification or
exception contained therein relating to materiality, Material Adverse Effect
or any similar qualification standard);

 



 

(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement set forth
herein by the Company, the Representative or the Sellers or in any Exhibit,
Schedule or certificate delivered hereunder (excluding in all cases any
nonfulfillment or breach of the Company or its Subsidiaries that occurs after
the Closing);

 



 

(iii) any claim by any current or former holder of Units or Options (but only
to the extent that such claim specifically arises out of or relates to such
Persons status as a current or former holder of Units or Options, as the case
may be); _provided_ , _however_ , the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _clause (iii)_ to the extent that such claim
arises under _Section 7.03_;

 



 

(iv) the Hartley Matter;

 



 

(v) any Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Transaction
Expenses, in each case to the extent not taken into account in determining the
Final Merger Consideration;

 



 

(vi) the matters set forth on the _Specific Indemnity Schedule_ ; or

 



 

(vii) the matters set forth on the _Disclosure Schedules Indemnity Schedule_.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than with respect to claims for fraud (in
which case a claim for fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that
committed such fraud), no claims by the Purchaser Parties arising from
indemnification claims made pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ or _Section
7.02(a)(vii)_ shall be asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of
Losses that would otherwise be payable hereunder from the Escrow Account or
through the exercise of the right of

 



      
 

 



 

set-off in accordance with _Section 7.02(c)_ exceeds, on a cumulative basis,
an amount equal to $5,850,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the
extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ that, the Deductible
shall not apply to any claims by the Purchaser on behalf of the Purchaser
Parties (A) to the extent based upon or arising or resulting from any breach
of any of the Fundamental Representations or any representation or warranty
set forth in _Section 4.08_ (Tax Matters) or (B) made pursuant to _Section
7.02(a)(ii)_, _Section 7.02(a)(iii)_, _Section 7.02(a)(iv)_, _Section
7.02(a)(v)_, _Section 7.02(a)(vi)_ or _Section 8.03_. In addition, other
than with respect to claims for fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may
only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud), (i) no
individual claim by the Purchaser on behalf of the Purchaser Parties shall be
so asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would be
payable pursuant to such claim exceeds an amount equal to $25,000 (the "
_Mini-Basket_ ") (it being understood that any such individual claims for
amounts less than the Mini-Basket shall be disregarded in determining whether
the Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter); _provided_ that, the Mini-
Basket shall not apply to any claims by the Purchaser on behalf of the
Purchaser Parties (A) to the extent based upon or arising or resulting from
any breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or any representation or
warranty set forth in _Section 4.08_ (Tax Matters) or (B) made pursuant to
_Section 7.02(a)(ii)_, _Section 7.02(a)(iii)_, _Section 7.02(a)(iv)_,
_Section 7.02(a)(v)_, _Section 7.02(a)(vi)_ or _Section 8.03_; and (ii) the
aggregate amount of all payments received by the Purchaser Parties (whether
from releases from the Escrow Account or through the exercise of the right of
set-off in accordance with _Section 7.02(c)_) in satisfaction of claims for
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ and _Section 8.03_ shall not
exceed $43,875,000 (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser Parties shall only be entitled to receive indemnification
payments pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ with respect to Losses that have
actually been suffered or incurred by the Purchaser Parties.

 



 

(b) Except in the case of fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may only be
asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud) or the right to
specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Purchaser Parties sole and exclusive remedies for any and
all Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including in any
Exhibit, Schedule or certificate delivered hereunder shall be limited to
recovery against the funds then remaining and available in the Escrow Account
pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ and the Escrow Agreement as their first
recourse, and thereafter, the right of set-off pursuant to _Section 7.02(c)_;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit any rights or remedies of the
Purchaser Parties arising pursuant to or in connection with the agreements
identified in _Section 3.02(h)_. The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the
other Purchaser Parties, agrees that other than in the case of fraud (in which
case a claim for fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that
committed such fraud), pursuant to the agreements required to be delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.02(h)_ or indirectly through the payment of all or a
portion of the Escrow Amount to the Purchaser Parties if and as required by
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the right of set-off
pursuant to _Section 7.02(c)_, under no circumstances will the
Representative, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, or their respective
officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") have
any liability to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or their respective
officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Parties_ ")
relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with the transactions contemplated hereby, including in any Exhibit, Schedule
or certificate delivered hereunder.

 



 

(c) If any Purchaser Party is entitled (pursuant only to an executed
settlement agreement between the Purchaser and the Representative or a
judgment or decree entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of
any Purchaser Party (a " _Final Determination_ ")) to payment of any amount
under this _Section 7.02_ or _Section 8.03(a)_ and if at such time no funds
remain in the Escrow Account or if there are good-faith indemnity claims in an
amount equal to or exceeding the then-current balance in the Escrow Account,
the Purchaser, on behalf of the Purchaser Parties, may set-off, or cause to be
set-off, such amount against amounts otherwise payable under pursuant to
_Section 2.03_. Prior to a Final Determination with respect to any
outstanding claim by the Purchaser, on behalf of the Purchaser Parties, under
this _Section 7.02_ or _Section 8.03(a)_, if at such time no funds are
available in the Escrow Account to satisfy such claim or if there are good-
faith indemnity claims in an amount equal to or exceeding the then-current
balance in the Escrow Account, the Purchaser, on behalf of the Purchaser
Parties, may withhold, or cause to be withheld, from the amounts otherwise
payable under _Section 2.03_ an amount equal to such outstanding claim and
instead deposit such amount (or cause such amount to be deposited) into an
escrow account for the benefit of the Sellers and the Purchaser Parties, which
amounts shall be released, as appropriate, to the Sellers (through the Paying
Agent) or the Purchaser Parties as directed in a Final Determination. In
connection with any amounts deposited into escrow pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the escrow amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent, or
another escrow agent mutually agreeable to the Purchaser and the
Representative, pursuant to an escrow agreement upon the same terms and in
substantially the same form as the Escrow Agreement, subject to such
modifications as are reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, the
Representative and the escrow agent thereunder.

 



 

(d) None of the Purchaser or the other Purchaser Parties may avoid the
limitations on liability set forth in this _Article VII_ by seeking damages
for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability and,
except in the case of fraud (in which case a claim for fraud may only be
asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud), the Purchaser, for
itself and the other Purchaser Parties, hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the Seller Parties
relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement
arising under or based upon any Law or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall have no right to
indemnification hereunder with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the
extent such Loss or alleged Loss is included in the determination of the Final
Merger Consideration and in such case, solely to the extent of such inclusion
therein.

 



 

(e) All payments made from the Escrow Account shall be treated by the parties
as an adjustment to the proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to _Article
III_ hereof.

 



 

(f) (i) Except for the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_, no Person
(including any Seller Party) shall have any obligation to fund the Escrow
Account and (ii) other than with respect to any amounts in the Escrow Account
which may be used to satisfy indemnification claims outstanding on such date
(which amounts shall remain in the Escrow Account until such matters are
finally resolved even if such matters are resolved following

 



      
 

 



 

September 30, 2014), the Escrow Agent shall transfer the balance of the Escrow
Account to the Sellers (pro rata according to each Sellers Residual
Percentage) on September 30, 2014, subject to and in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

7.03 _Indemnification by the Purchaser for the Benefit of the Sellers_. From
and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article VII_),
the Representative, on behalf of the Seller Parties, shall be entitled to
assert, as the Seller Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any action
relating (directly or indirectly) to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than with respect to claims for fraud (in which
case a claim for fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that
committed such fraud) or the right to specific performance or other equitable
relief in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and only in accordance
with the terms of this _Article VII_, claims in respect of any Losses that
the Representative determined in good faith may be suffered or incurred by the
Seller Parties or any of them to the extent arising or resulting from:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein by the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub or in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate
delivered hereunder (it being understood and agreed that the existence of any
such breach of any representation or warranty referred to in this _clause
(a)_ and any resulting Losses shall be determined without regard to any
qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality, material
adverse effect or any similar qualification standard);

 



 

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement set forth herein
by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub or in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate
delivered hereunder;

 



 

(c) any claim or suit brought against any of the Seller Parties at any time on
or after the Closing Date relating to actions taken by the Purchaser, the
Surviving Company or their respective Subsidiaries on or after the Closing
Date other than any claim or action by the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
7.02_; or

 



 

(d) any claim or suit pursuant to any obligations set forth on the _Guarantees
Schedule_ , but in each case only if a claim has not been made against such
guarantee as of the Closing Date.

 



 

Any indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ shall be delivered to the
applicable Seller Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by the Representative within fifteen (15)
days after the Final Determination thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
other than with respect to claims for fraud (in which case a claim for fraud
may only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such fraud), no
claims by the Representative on behalf of the Seller Parties arising from
indemnification claims made pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_ shall be asserted
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be
payable hereunder by the Purchaser in respect of its indemnification
obligations hereunder exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to the
Deductible, and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible;
_provided_ that, the Deductible shall not apply to any claims by the
Representative on behalf of the Seller Parties (A) to the extent based upon or
arising or resulting from any breach of any of the Fundamental Representations
or (B) made

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_, _Section 7.03(c)_ or _Section 7.03(d)_. In
addition, other than with respect to claims for fraud (in which case a claim
for fraud may only be asserted against the Person(s) that committed such
fraud), (i) no individual claim by the Representative shall be so asserted
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable pursuant
to such claim exceeds an amount equal to the Mini-Basket (it being understood
that any such individual claims for amounts less than the Mini-Basket shall be
disregarded in determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded and
thereafter); _provided_ that, the Mini-Basket shall not apply to any claims by
the Representative on behalf of the Seller Parties (A) to the extent based
upon or arising or resulting from any breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations or (B) made pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_, _Section 7.03(c)_
or _Section 7.03(d)_; and (ii) the aggregate amount of all payments received
by the Seller Parties in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant
to this _Section 7.03_ shall not exceed $43,875,000. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Seller Parties shall only be entitled to receive indemnification
payments pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ with respect to Losses that have
actually been suffered or incurred by the Seller Parties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, this _Section 7.03_ shall not limit any
rights or remedies of the Seller Parties arising pursuant to or in connection
with the Warrant or Registration Rights Agreement.

 



 

7.04 _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ or
under _Section 8.03_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ," it being understood and agreed
that only the Representative shall have the right to make a claim for
indemnification under this _Article VII_ on behalf of the Seller Parties and
only the Purchaser shall have the right to make a claim for indemnification
under this _Article VII_ or _Section 8.03_ on behalf of the Purchaser
Parties) shall notify the Purchaser (in the case of a claim by the
Representative on behalf of the Seller Parties) or the Representative (in the
case of a claim by the Purchaser on behalf of the Purchaser Parties) (in such
context, the Purchaser or the Representative being referred to herein as an "
_Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written
notice of any pending or threatened action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation
or other claim against it (if by a third party) or discovering the liability,
obligation, or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, describing
the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis
thereof (it being understood that such Indemnitee may assert a claim for
indemnification hereunder by sending written notice to the Indemnitor pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, and shall not be required to file an actual
claim for indemnification with a Governmental Entity in order to properly
deliver a notice of a claim hereunder); _provided_ that (i) subject to
_Section 7.01_, the failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent, and only to the
extent, the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure,
and (ii) references to payment obligations or similar references of the
Indemnitor when the Indemnitor is the Representative shall only be satisfied
out of the funds then remaining and available in the Escrow Account pursuant
to _Section 7.02_ and the Escrow Agreement and the right of set-off pursuant
to _Section 7.02(c)_. In that regard, if any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation, or other claim shall be brought or asserted by any third party
which, if adversely determined, would entitle the Indemnitee to indemnity
pursuant to this _Article VII_ or under _Section 8.03_, the Indemnitee shall
promptly notify the Indemnitor of the same in writing, specifying in detail
the basis of such claim and the facts pertaining thereto, but, subject to
_Section 7.01_, failure to provide such notification shall not affect the
rights of the Indemnitee hereunder except to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent set forth in _clause (i)_ to the proviso to the preceding sentence.
Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an
Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at
its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with reputable
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ that any
Indemnitor shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any
claims contained herein; and _provided further_ that the Indemnitor shall not
have the right to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and
expenses of reputable counsel retained by the Indemnitee and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitor, if the claim which the Indemnitor seeks to
control (t) involves a claim that is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Indemnitees reputation, customer or supplier relations
or future business prospects, (u) seeks equitable or injunctive relief, except
where equitable or injunctive relief is incidental to a primary claim or
claims for monetary damages, (v) is brought by a Governmental Entity, except
as provided in _Section 8.03(j)_, (w) involves criminal allegations, (x)
would reasonably be expected to result in greater liability to the Indemnitee
than the Indemnitor, taking into account the Deductible, the Indemnification
Cap and other limitations on indemnification herein; (y) is one in which the
Indemnitor is also a party and joint representation would be inappropriate or
there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnitee that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnitor, or (z) involves a
claim which, upon petition by the Indemnitee, the appropriate court rules that
the Indemnitor failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend (each of
_clauses (t)_ through _(z)_ , a " _Litigation Condition_ "). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser and the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to control the defense of the Hartley Matter; _provided_ that, the
Purchaser and the Surviving Company shall permit the Representative, at its
own expense, to participate in the defense of the Hartley Matter.

 



 

(b) If the Indemnitor is permitted to assume and control the defense and
elects to do so, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ counsel
separate from counsel employed by the Indemnitor in any such action and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnitee that are incurred after the Indemnitors assumption
and control of the defense shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless
the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnitor in
writing.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; _provided_ , that, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if,
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim without prejudice.
If the Indemnitee shall control the defense of any such claim due to (i) the
Indemnitors election not to assume control of the defense of such claim or
(ii) is unable to assume control of the defense of such claim due to the
existence of one or more Litigation Conditions, the Indemnitee shall not pay
or settle any such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
shall not be required if (i) the terms of such settlement obligate the
Indemnitee to pay the full amount of damages in connection with such claim
(including amounts covered by the then-remaining Deductible) and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitor
from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim without
prejudice. If the Purchaser is asserting a claim for indemnification under
_Section 7.02_ or _Section 8.03_ hereof, the Representative and/or Sellers
shall have the rights of the Indemnitor hereunder and the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses of the Representative and/or the Sellers
incurred in defending a claim (or any participation in a claim that could
result in a disbursement to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account) shall be
reimbursed, when and as incurred, from the funds remaining in the Escrow
Account.

 



 

7.05 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under _Section 7.02_ or _7.03_ shall be calculated net of (i)
any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates on
account of such Loss on or before the second anniversary of the end of the
taxable year in which the Loss occurs and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered (net of
any deductible payable with respect to the applicable insurance policy,
indemnity contribution or similar payment borne and any related cost of
collection, in each case by a Purchaser Party or Seller Party) by the
Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto (including pursuant to
any indemnities from prior acquisitions by the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries and to any representation and warranty insurance policies). A Tax
benefit shall be realized upon the receipt of a refund of Taxes paid or the
filing of a Tax Return, including an estimated Tax Return, showing a Tax
benefit (or, if earlier, the date when such a Tax Return should have been
timely filed, including properly obtained extensions) calculated on a "with
and without" basis with respect to Tax benefits arising as a result of such
Loss. The Indemnitee shall seek, as its first recourse, full recovery under
all indemnities (other than this Agreement) and insurance policies (including
pursuant to any indemnities from prior acquisitions by the Surviving Company
and its Subsidiaries and to any representation and warranty insurance
policies) covering any Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were
not subject to indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that the Indemnitee
shall be permitted to make a claim for indemnification following the
submission of any claim under any other indemnity or insurance policy
(including any representation and warranty insurance policy); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the preceding proviso shall not
change the priority of recourse set forth in this sentence. In the event that
an insurance or other recovery specified in the first sentence of this
_Section 7.05_ is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which
any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (less the cost of collection of such recovery
and any portion of the Loss paid by the Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof
(and not indemnified hereunder) due to the limitation on liability provisions
(including the Deductible or any deductible under any representation or
warranty insurance policy) that may be applicable to such recovery) shall be
made promptly to the Indemnitor. Each party hereby waives, to the extent
permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that
its insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses.

7.07 _Other Indemnification Provisions_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein shall in no
way be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state
of facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or
breach is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.
The Seller Parties and the Purchaser Parties respective rights to
indemnification with respect to the representations and warranties of the
Company, the Purchaser and the Merger Sub set forth herein, and the covenants
of the parties hereto shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Seller Party or Purchaser Party
(including by any of its advisors, consultants or representatives) or by
reason of the fact that the Company or the Purchaser, or any of their
respective advisors, consultants or representatives, knew or should have known

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 



 

8.01 _Disclosure Generally_. All Disclosure Schedules and exhibits attached
hereto are incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as
though completely

 



      
 

 



 

set forth herein. Without modifying or limiting the introductory language to
_Article IV_ or _Article V_, all references to this Agreement herein or in
any of the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits shall be deemed to refer to this
entire Agreement, including all Disclosure Schedules and exhibits.

 



 

8.02 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Each of the Purchaser, the
Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries hereby agrees, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between the Purchaser, the Surviving Company
and/or their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Representative,
the Sellers and/or their respective Affiliates, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (" _K
andE_") may represent the Representative, the Sellers or any of their respective
directors, managers, equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees or
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such Persons may be
directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, and even though KandE may have represented the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub further
agree that, as to all communications among KandE, the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, the Representative, the Sellers and/or any of their
respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) and may be
controlled by the Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and a
third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Company or any of the Surviving
Companys Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by KandE to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Surviving Company nor any of the
Surviving Companys Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Representative, on behalf of the Sellers.

 



 

8.03 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Indemnity_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VII_, the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be indemnified from the Escrow Account and
pursuant to the right of set-off pursuant to _Section 7.02(c)_ from and
against (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Blocker Corp for all taxable periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp (or any predecessor of any of
the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any
Person imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp
as a transferee or successor, by contract (other than (x) any such customary
agreements with customers, vendors, lenders, lessors or the like entered into
in the Ordinary Course of Business, (y) property Taxes payable with respect to
leased property and (z) any other agreements for which Taxes are not the

 



      
 

 



 

principal subject matter) or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which
Taxes are imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Blocker
Corp as a result of an event or transaction occurring on or prior to the
Closing, but, in each case, excluding (1) any Taxes to the extent taken into
account in determining the Final Merger Consideration, (2) any Taxes that are
attributable to an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law) by the Purchaser, the Company or any
of their Affiliates, (3) any Taxes attributable to any events occurring after
the Closing on the Closing Date outside the Ordinary Course of Business and
undertaken by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, and (4) any Taxes attributable
to a breach by the Purchaser (or, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp) of any of the covenants made by such parties
herein. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes described in _clause (i)_ of the
preceding sentence shall be determined in a manner reflecting the provisions
of _Section 8.03(e)_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Tax
period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any
Taxes other than gross receipts, payments, sales, use or withholding Taxes and
Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period,
and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income and any gross
receipts, payments, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time).

 



 

(b) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The Sellers shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed (with the cooperation of
the Purchaser) any (i) partnership income Tax Returns for the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (ii) any income Tax Returns for the Blocker Corp, in each
case, with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date.
For the purpose of preparing the Tax Returns described in the preceding
sentence, (x) the parties agree that the 2012 partnership income Tax Returns
for the Company and Actient Therapeutics LLC shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the final Schedules K-1 distributed with respect thereto and
(y) for any partnership or other flow-through entity in which the Company or
its Subsidiaries own an interest (directly, or through other partnerships or
flow-through entities) whose taxable year does not end on the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall prepare or caused to be prepared, at the Sellers sole
cost and expense, pro forma income Tax Returns reflecting a "closing of the
books" for such partnership or flow-through entity as of the end of the
Closing Date and provide such pro forma Tax Returns to the Representative at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date any Tax Returns described in the
preceding sentence are required to be filed; _provided_ , that the parties
hereto agree that the pro forma Tax Return for Actient Therapeutics LLC will
reflect an adjustment to reverse any overallocation of items of income to
Slate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for 2012 (and corresponding underallocation to
Actient Holdings LLC). The Representative shall be entitled to review and
comment on any such pro forma Tax Return and the Purchaser shall accept and
reflect on such pro forma Tax Return any reasonable comments provided by the
Representative and any Tax Returns filed or caused to be filed by the
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be consistent with the pro
forma Tax Returns reflecting the reasonable comments of the Representative.
The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to

 



      
 

 



 

be timely filed all other Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the Blocker Corp for all periods (or portions thereof) ending prior to or
including the Closing Date the due date of which (including extensions) is
after the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared and timely
filed in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required
by a change in applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date on
which each such Tax Return is required to be filed, the Purchaser shall submit
such Tax Return to the Representative for the Representatives review and
approval as provided in the third-to-last sentence of this _Section 8.03(b)_.
The Purchaser shall accept and reflect on such Tax Return any reasonable
comments provided by the Representative. No Tax Return described in this
_Section 8.03(b)_ shall be filed without the written consent of
Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute arising under this
_Section 8.03(b)_ within fifteen (15) days for the final due date of filing
an applicable Tax Return (including available automatic extensions), the
parties shall submit the dispute to the Valuation Firm, which will promptly
determine those matters in dispute (based on presentations from the parties
and not based on its independent review) and will render a written report as
to the disputed matters. The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be
split evenly by the Purchaser and the Representative.

 



 

(c) _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, the Purchaser will not (i) except for Tax Returns that are filed in
accordance with _Section 8.03(b)_, file or amend or permit the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp to file or amend any
Tax Return relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) with respect
to Tax Returns filed pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_, after the date such Tax
Returns are filed pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_, amend or permit any of the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp to amend any
such Tax Return, (iii) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or
permit the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp to
extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other period for the assessment
of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (iv) make or
change any election or change any method of accounting with respect to Taxes
with retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for any of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the Representatives failure to consent to an amendment of any Tax
Return described in _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ of the preceding sentence that
would affect the amount of any items shown on any Schedule K-1 (or
corresponding state or local schedule) previously received by any Seller shall
be treated as reasonable.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser will pay, and will indemnify and hold the
Sellers harmless against, any transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration
and real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, equity
transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Blocker Corp, the Company,
the Surviving Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Sellers as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer
Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes.
The Representative agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in the filing of any
returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including by promptly supplying
any information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete
such returns.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Determinations Concerning Pre-Closing Taxes_. In connection with the
preparation of Tax Returns under _Section 8.03(b)_, the Purchaser and the
Sellers agree that all Tax deductions and credits related to (i) the payment
of any transaction-related fees and/or bonuses (or similar amounts) or any
Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses or to the deduction of any deferred
financing costs, in each case, arising out of the sale of the Blocker Corp,
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Purchaser (and any transactions
related thereto) shall be treated as properly allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period ending on the Closing Date and (ii) the exercise or cancellation of any
Options outstanding as of March 18, 2013 as a result of the consummation of
the Transaction shall be treated as properly allocable to a Tax Period
beginning after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The parties shall apply the safe harbor election set forth in
Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to determine the amount of
any success-based fees that are deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. The
Purchaser and the Sellers agree that the U.S. federal income tax year of the
Blocker Corp will end as of the end of the Closing Date. The Purchaser and the
Sellers agree to prepare all Tax Returns with respect to the Blocker Corp, the
Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with this _Section 8.03(e)_, whether
or not such Tax Return is described in _Section 8.03(b)_. For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event that any taxing authority re-allocates any items
described in this _Section 8.03(e)_ in an alternate manner than that
described in this _Section 8.03(e)_, no party hereto shall be entitled to a
payment from any other party for the consequences of such re-allocation.

 



 

(f) _Tax Refunds_. The Sellers shall be entitled to any Tax refunds or credits
that are received by the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries
or the Blocker Corp attributable to Taxes paid by the Sellers, the Company or
its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion thereof) (including any Tax refunds attributable to the
carryback of items other than items arising after the Closing Date), and the
Purchaser shall pay (net of any reasonable collection costs) to the Paying
Agent for further payment to the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Representative
any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days
after actual receipt of such refund or credit against Taxes. After the
Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
and the Blocker Corp to continue to work in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to diligently prosecute any Tax refund claims
in order to legally maximize and obtain any such Tax refunds or credits.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.03(f)_, promptly
upon the receipt of any income Tax refunds attributable to Slate
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with respect to the taxable year that ends on the
Closing Date, and in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the actual
receipt of such Tax refund, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, deliver and pay to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount of such Tax refund (net of reasonable
collection costs) or, if less, an amount equal to the estimated amount of
income Tax liability of the Blocker Corp for the taxable year that ends on the
Closing Date, determined by the Purchaser and the Representative in good
faith, at which time such amount shall be deemed to constitute a part of the
Escrow Amount for all purposes under this Agreement. Any amount paid to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence that is not
actually used to pay income Tax liability of the Blocker Corp for the taxable
year that ends on the Closing Date shall be released to the Sellers by the
Escrow Agent promptly after the filing of the U.S. federal income Tax return
for the Blocker Corp for the taxable year that ends on the Closing Date. The
portion of any income Tax refunds attributable to Slate

 



      
 

 



 

Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with respect to the taxable year that ends on the
Closing Date that is not paid to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the second
immediately preceding sentence shall be paid to the Sellers in accordance with
the first sentence of this _Section 8.03(f)_.

 



 

(g) _Request for Tax Returns_. At the request of the Representative, the
Purchaser shall deliver to the Representative copies of all Tax Returns
relating to the tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(h) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any Affiliate of the Company other than one of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, shall be terminated and all payables and receivables arising
thereunder shall be settled, in each case prior to the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date, neither the Surviving Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
have any further rights or liabilities thereunder or under any payables or
receivables arising thereunder.

 



 

(i) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser and the Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Tax Returns or Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return,
audit, litigation or other proceeding or any tax planning, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.

 



 

(j) _Audits of Tax Returns_. At its election, the Representative, on behalf of
the Sellers, will have the responsibility for, and the right to control, the
audit (i) of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Blocker Corp relating to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) any Tax Return of the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp relating to a taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date if the Sellers have more at stake in
such audit than the Purchaser does (as reasonably determined by the
Representative and the Purchaser, taking into account Taxes that would be
directly payable by the Sellers and any Taxes of the Purchaser or the Company
or its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp that would be indemnifiable by the
Sellers hereunder), including any disposition of such audit; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser and the Surviving Company will have the right,
directly or through its designated representatives, to review in advance and
comment upon all submissions made in the course of audits of such Tax Returns
(including any administrative appeals thereof). With respect to all other Tax
Returns, the Purchaser and the Surviving Company will have the responsibility
for, and the right to control the audit of, such Tax Returns, but, in respect
of obligations under _Section 8.03(a)_, with respect to any Tax Return that
relates in whole or in part to any period (or portion of a period) prior to
the Closing, the Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall have the
right, directly or through its designated representatives, to review in
advance and comment upon all submissions made in the course of audits of such
Tax Returns (including any administrative appeals thereof), and the Surviving
Company shall not dispose of any audit of any such Tax Return without the
consent of the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Sellers and the Purchaser agree that an
election under Section 754 of the Code (and any analogous state or local
provision) (the " _Section 754 Election_") shall be made for the Company and
that the Company and the Surviving Companys Tax Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with such election. For purposes of determining (i) the
adjustments to tax basis of the Companys assets under Section 743(b) of the
Code resulting from the Section 754 Election and (ii) the portion of the gain
or loss recognized by the Sellers upon the sale and purchase of the Units
pursuant to this Agreement that is attributable to the Companys "unrealized
receivables" and "inventory items" (as such terms are defined in Section 751
of the Code), the Purchaser, the Sellers and the Representative agree that the
Final Merger Consideration (excluding any amounts attributable to the
acquisition of the Shares, but plus other relevant items required under the
Code, including the Purchasers share of the liabilities of the Company as
determined under Section 752 of the Code) will be allocated among the
Companys assets in accordance with Code Section 755 and the regulations

Purchaser and the Representative and in accordance with the methodology set
forth on _Exhibit L_. The Representative will deliver its calculation of such
allocation to the Company within 90 days after the Closing Date (the "
_Sellers  Allocation_"). In the event that the Purchaser objects to the
Sellers Allocation, the Purchaser shall notify the Representative of its
objection to such allocation within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the
Sellers Allocation, and the parties will endeavor in good faith over the next
fifteen (15) days to resolve such dispute. If the parties are unable to

submit the dispute to the Valuation Firm, which will promptly determine those
matters in dispute (based on presentations from the parties and not based on
its independent review) and will render a written report as to the disputed
matters (the matters determined by such valuation firm, together with those
matters that were agreed by the parties, the " _Agreed Allocation_ "). The
costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be split evenly by the Purchaser
and the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). The Purchaser, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, the Blocker Corp and the Representative will file any
Tax Returns and any other governmental filings on a basis consistent with such
allocation of fair market value. Neither the Purchaser nor the Representative
nor any of their Affiliates will take any position (whether in audits, tax
returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless
required to do so by applicable law.

 



 

(l) _Blocker Corp Liabilities and Refunds_. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding the foregoing, as between the Blocker Seller and the Sellers
other than the Blocker Seller, any liability for Taxes of the Blocker Corp for
which indemnification is provided under this _Section 8.03_ will be borne
solely by the Blocker Seller and any refunds of Taxes paid by or attributable
to the Blocker Corp described in _Section 8.03(f)_ shall exclusively be for
the account of the Blocker Seller, in each case as determined by the
Representative in its good faith discretion.

 



 

(m) _No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. Neither the Purchaser nor the
Merger Sub nor their Affiliates shall take any action with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corp that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

 



      
 

 



 

8.04 _Blocker Seller Release_. Effective as of the Closing, the Blocker Seller
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases the Company and its
Affiliates, from any and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits,
damages, judgments, expenses, demands and other obligations or liabilities, of
any nature whatsoever, in law or in equity, in each case, whether absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, and whether arising
under any agreement or understanding taking place on or prior to the Closing
Date (collectively, " _Claims_ "); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not

ARTICLE X

 



 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 



 

10.01 _Representative_.

 



 

(a) _Authority_. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to the Delaware
LLC Law, the Sellers hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint the
Representative as the

 



       
 

 



 

representative, agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact for each of the Sellers for
all purposes authorized under this Agreement, including the full power and
authority on the Sellers behalf (i) to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein; (ii) to pay such Sellers expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement (whether incurred on or
after the date hereof), including by using funds from the Representative
Holdback Amount; (iii) to hold the Warrant on behalf of the Sellers; (iv) to
disburse any funds (including dividends and distributions on the Warrant) or
Warrant Shares received hereunder to such Seller and each other Seller; (v) to
endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments representing the Units and
execute such further instruments of assignment as the Purchaser or the Merger
Sub shall reasonably request; (vi) to execute and deliver on behalf of such
Seller any amendment or waiver hereto; (vii) (A) to dispute or refrain from
disputing, or to deliver instructions, on behalf of such Seller relative to
any amounts to be received by such Seller under any Transaction Document or
any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby, any claim made by the
Purchaser under any Transaction Document or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or thereby, (B) to negotiate and compromise, on behalf of such Seller,
any dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising any
remedies available under, the Transaction Documents or any other agreement
contemplated hereby or thereby, and (C) to execute, on behalf of such Seller,
any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to such
dispute or remedy; (viii) to engage attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of the Sellers in connection with the Transaction
Documents or any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby and paying any
fees related thereto; (ix) to take all other actions to be taken by or on
behalf of such Seller in connection herewith; (x) to retain the Representative
Holdback Amount and pay amounts therefrom in accordance with this Agreement;
and (xi) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such
Seller or the Sellers collectively are permitted or required to do or exercise
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; _provided_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative shall not have the
authority to agree to any amendment of this Agreement or enter into any
agreement or take any of the foregoing actions that would (x) result in any
Seller having indemnification obligations in excess of his, her or its
proceeds from the Merger or (y) treat any holder of a class of Units
differently than other holders of such class of Units. Each of the Sellers
agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall survive the
death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. If
any Seller dies or becomes incapacitated, disabled or incompetent (such
deceased, incapacitated, disabled or incompetent Seller being a " _Former
Seller_ ") and, as a result, the agency and power of attorney conferred by
this _Section 10.01_ is revoked by operation of law, it shall not be a breach
by such Former Seller under this Agreement if the heirs, beneficiaries,
estate, administrator, executor, guardian, conservator or other legal
representative of such Former Seller (each a " _Successor Seller_ ") confirms
the appointment of the Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact for such
Successor Seller. All decisions and actions by the Representative (to the
extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Sellers,
and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same.

 



 

(b) _Authority; Indemnification._ Each Seller agrees that the Purchaser, the
Merger Sub and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to rely on any action
taken by the Representative, on behalf of such Seller, pursuant to _Section
10.01(a)_ above (an " _Authorized Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action
shall be binding on each Seller as fully as if such Seller had taken such
Authorized Action. The Purchaser and the Merger Sub agree that the

 



      
 

 



 

Representative, as the Representative, shall have no liability to the
Purchaser and the Merger Sub for any Authorized Action, except to the extent
that such Authorized Action is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have constituted fraud or willful misconduct. Each Seller hereby severally
(based on such Sellers Residual Percentage), for itself only and not jointly
and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Representative
against all fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts incurred by the Representative in connection with
any action, suit or proceeding to which the Representative is made a party by
reason of the fact it is or was acting as the Representative pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Exculpation_. The Representative shall not have by reason of this
Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller, except in respect
of amounts received on behalf of such Seller. The Representative shall not be
liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent
employed by it hereunder or under any other document entered into in
connection herewith, except that the Representative shall not be relieved of
any liability imposed by law for willful misconduct. The Representative shall
not be liable to the Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments
made by the Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they
are determined to have been entitled. The Representative shall not be required
to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of
the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the
Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any
Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Representative for any
reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud or bad faith.

 



 

(d) _Representative Holdback Amount_. Upon the final Applicable Limitation
Date, if there are no open claims to be resolved with respect to the merger
consideration adjustments as set forth in _Article II_, and no outstanding
claims to be resolved pursuant to _Article VII_ or _Section 8.03_, the
Representative will within five (5) Business Days of such date obtain
reimbursement for any outstanding Representative Expenses for which it is due
reimbursement under this Agreement and for which it has not been reimbursed
prior to such time and distribute any remaining portion of the Representative
Holdback Amount to the Sellers on a pro rata basis according to each Sellers
Residual Percentage, it being understood and agreed that such distribution(s)
shall be the responsibility of the Representative only and that neither the
Purchaser nor the Surviving Company shall have any obligation to ensure that
such distribution is, or distributions are, made. If there are open claims
that remain unresolved with respect to the merger consideration adjustments as
set forth in _Article II_ or outstanding claims to be resolved pursuant to
_Article VII_ or _Section 8.03_ on the final Applicable Limitation Date, the
Representative will within five (5) Business Days after the date of resolution
of such claims obtain reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement and for which
it has not been reimbursed prior to such time and distribute any remaining
portion of the Representative Holdback Amount to the Sellers on a pro rata
basis according to each Sellers Residual Percentage, it being understood and
agreed that such distribution(s) shall be the responsibility of the
Representative only and that neither the Purchaser nor the Surviving Company
shall have any obligation to ensure that such distribution is, or
distributions are, made. If the Representative Holdback Amount is insufficient

 



      
 

 



 

to reimburse the Representative in full, the Representative may instruct the
Purchaser or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, when making any payments to
the Sellers, to direct to the Representative sufficient funds from such
payments to the Sellers to pay the amount of any such shortfall to the
Representative. Such payment to the Representative shall be deducted from the
funds otherwise being directed to the Sellers, and allocated among the Sellers
on a pro rata basis according to each Sellers Residual Percentage.

 



 

(e) _Blocker Corp Assets and Liabilities_. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, as between the Blocker Seller
and the Sellers other than the Blocker Seller, any liabilities of the Sellers
in respect of the Blocker Corp will be borne solely by the Blocker Seller and
any assets of the Sellers in respect of, or increase in the Merger
Consideration attributable to, the Blocker Corp (including any Cash held by
the Blocker Corp) shall be for the account of the Blocker Seller, in each case
as determined by the Representative in its good faith discretion.

 



 

10.02 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, shall be issued or made by any party hereto (or any Affiliate to a
party hereto) without the joint approval of the Purchaser and the
Representative, unless required by Law (in the reasonable advice of counsel)
in which case the Purchaser and the Representative shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, have the right to review such press release,
announcement or communication prior to issuance, distribution or publication,
it being acknowledged and agreed that the Purchaser is a publicly traded
corporation and therefore will be required to publicly disclose the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including on a Current Report on Form 8-K and, in connection therewith, will
be required to attach as an exhibit thereto a copy of this Agreement.

 



 

10.03 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Company
and the Representative, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and the Merger Sub,
on the other hand, shall pay all of their own expenses (including attorneys
and accountants fees and expenses) in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement, the performance of their obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the
Purchaser shall pay the Transaction Expenses on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in _Section 3.02(k)_.

 



 

10.04 _Knowledge Defined_. For purposes of this Agreement, "the Companys
knowledge" and "knowledge of the Company" as used herein shall mean the actual
knowledge of Christopher Curtin, Edward Donovan, Edward J. Fiorentino, Edmund
Orme, Vicky Papoutsis, Steven R. Pollock, Bryan Reiners, Mark Tatro and
Charles Tobler, and "the Purchasers knowledge" as used herein shall mean the
actual knowledge of Adrian Adams, Jim Fickenscher and Andrew Koven.

 



 

10.05 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered,
(b) when transmitted via facsimile device to the number set out below if the
sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized
overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (c) the day following

same has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight air courier

shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be

ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without

fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any
such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in _Section 10.05_ shall be deemed effective service of process on

 _Rules of Engagement for Valuation Firm_

 



 

If a Valuation Firm is engaged pursuant to _Article II_, the parties will
instruct the Valuation Firm to analyze and resolve the parties dispute in
accordance with the following guidelines (which guidelines and relevant
portions of this Agreement the Valuation Firm will be required to review and
commit to acting in accordance with):

 



 

 _Retainer and Fees_

 



 

The fees, costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm shall be borne by the
parties in inverse proportion to the relative success of the parties relating
to the disputed items submitted to the Valuation Firm, with such determination
of relative success made by the Valuation Firm, or if the Valuation Firm is
unwilling to make such a determination, then such fees, costs and expenses
shall be borne 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the Sellers.

 



 

To the extent the Valuation Firm requires a retainer or payment of expenses
prior to its final determination, the Purchaser and the Sellers will each pay
50% of any retainer and, during the engagement, the Valuation Firm will bill
50% of the total charges to the Purchaser and 50% of the total charges to the
Sellers. Such fees, costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm shall be
adjusted, if necessary, pursuant to the first paragraph of this "Retainer and
Fees" section.

 



 

 _Parameters of Arbitration_

 



 

Except as permitted herein in order to clarify or understand any position or
argument made by a party in its written submission, the Valuation Firms
determination of the Net Working Capital, the Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries outstanding at the Closing, the Transaction Expenses unpaid
and outstanding as of the Closing Date, and the amount of Cash held by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing and the resulting Final Merger
Consideration shall be based solely on written presentations submitted by the
Purchaser and the Representative which are in accordance with the guidelines
and procedures (including the definitions of Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses and Net Working Capital, and the calculations set forth on _Exhibit
D_) set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent
review). The Valuation Firm shall consider only the disputed matters that were
included in the Objections Statement and the Valuation Firm may not assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value assigned by the
Purchaser in the Preliminary Statement, on the one hand, or the Representative
in the Objections Statement, on the other hand, or less than the smallest
value for such item assigned by the Purchaser in the Preliminary Statement, on
the one hand, or the Representative in the Objections Statement, on the other
hand.

 



 

The timetable for these proceedings will be governed by the following
procedures:

 



 

* Within thirty (30) calendar days of retaining the Valuation Firm, each of the Purchaser and the Representative shall submit to the Valuation Firm a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions of all unresolved disputed items in accordance with _Article II_ of this Agreement (the " _Initial Report_ ").

      
 

 



 

* Within one (1) Business Day upon receipt of both the Purchasers and the Representatives Initial Reports, the Valuation Firm will distribute a copy of each Initial Report to the other party.

 



 

* Within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving the other partys Initial Report from the Valuation Firm, each of the Purchaser and the Representative may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Valuation Firm a memorandum responding to the Initial Report submitted to the Valuation Firm by the other party (the " _Rebuttal Report_ "). The Rebuttal Report is to be responsive solely to the arguments raised, and information submitted, by the other party in its Initial Report and no party may introduce new arguments or rely on new information in the Rebuttal Report that was not part of such partys Initial Report or which are not directly responsive to an argument raised by the other partys Initial Report, except to the extent such new arguments or new information are used in direct response to arguments raised and information submitted by the other party in its Initial Report.

 



 

* Within one (1) Business Day upon receipt of the Rebuttal Reports from the Purchaser and the Representative, the Valuation Firm will distribute a copy of each Rebuttal Report to the other party.

 



 

* At any time before or within fifteen (15) calendar days after the submission of the Initial Reports or any Rebuttal Reports by the Purchaser and the Representative, the Valuation Firm may submit written questions to either party following the procedures set forth below in the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Valuation Firm."

 



 

* Upon receipt of the Rebuttal Report or notice waiving the right to file such report from both the Purchaser and the Representative and receipt of all responses to any written questions submitted by the Valuation Firm (and responses thereto), the Valuation Firm will endeavor to issue a report containing its findings within fifteen (15) calendar days after the later of (i) receiving both the Purchasers and the Representatives Rebuttal Reports or notice waiving the right to file such report, as applicable, or (ii) any responses (if any) to any written questions submitted by the Valuation Firm to either party following the procedures set forth below in the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Valuation Firm."

 



 

* Unless requested by the Valuation Firm in writing pursuant to the terms of the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Valuation Firm", neither the Purchaser nor the Representative may present any additional information or arguments to the Valuation Firm, either orally or in writing.

 



 

* The Valuation Firm shall render its decision without conducting a hearing.

 



 

 _Submission of Questions by the Valuation Firm_

 



 

After receiving both Initial Reports and Rebuttal Reports, if any, the
Valuation Firm may submit written questions to the parties for written
responses or may direct requests for additional information, calculations, or
supporting documentation to the parties reasonably needed by the Valuation
Firm in order to clarify or understand any position or argument made by a
party in its written submission, in which case the parties agree to cooperate
with such requests (including, without limitation, by ensuring that the
Valuation Firm is provided copies of all relevant records

      
 

 



 

of the business in accordance with _Article II_ of this Agreement) in the
manner and procedural timing described in this paragraph. If any such
questions are addressed to only one party, the Valuation Firm shall submit the
questions to that party, with a copy to the other parties. Once received, the
party (or parties) to whom the questions are addressed shall have five (5)
Business Days to answer the Valuation Firms questions, and shall provide a
copy of its written answers to the other party at the time they are provided
to the Valuation Firm. In response thereto, the other party may, within five
(5) Business Days, submit a response to such answer(s) to the Valuation Firm
and shall provide a copy of a response to the other party at the time it is
provided to the Valuation Firm. If any such questions are addressed to both
parties, each party shall have five (5) Business Days from the date of receipt
to respond to the Valuation Firm and shall provide a copy of its written
answers to the other parties at the time they are provided to the Valuation
Firm. In response thereto, each party may, within five (5) Business Days,
submit a response to the other partys answer(s) to the Valuation Firm and
shall provide a copy to the other party at the time it is provided to the
Valuation Firm.

 



 

 _Adjustment of Time Periods_

 



 

If the due date for any written submissions to be submitted to the Valuation
Firm falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the written submission shall
take place on the next Business Day.

 



 

 _Communication between the Valuation Firm and the Parties_

 



 

The parties agree not to engage in any ex parte communication with the
Valuation Firm.

 



 

The Valuation Firm will be required to include a representation in its
engagement letter that it has not discussed the substance of the disputed
matter with either party prior to its joint retention by the parties, and to
include a covenant in its engagement letter not to engage in ex parte
communications with either party throughout the course of the engagement.

 



 

The engagement letter will specifically require the Valuation Firm to review
_Article II_ of this Agreement, as well as any other provisions of this
Agreement deemed relevant by any of the Purchaser, the Seller or the Valuation
Firm.

 



 

 _Nature of Review by Valuation Firm_

 



 

The Valuation Firm will make its determination in an objective, impartial
manner based on inquiry, investigation, and other procedures as it, in its
sole discretion may deem necessary, but in all cases consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and this _Exhibit E_.

 



 

The Valuation Firm shall agree that between the time the Representative
delivered the Objections Statement to the Purchaser and the date hereof, the
Purchaser and the Representative may have exchanged certain proposals relating
to the disputed items that were intended solely for purposes of facilitating
settlement discussions and such proposals were confidential and were provided
solely on the condition and understanding that such proposals would not be
permitted to be disclosed in any court or arbitration hearing, including with
respect to the Valuation Firms engagement in the dispute. The Valuation Firm
will be instructed to disregard any evidence of such settlement proposals and
negotiations in its consideration of the disputed matter.

      
 

 



 

 _Confidentiality_

 



 

With respect to any information supplied in connection with the Valuation
Firms engagement and designated by either party as confidential, or which
either party should reasonably believe is confidential based on the subject
matter or the circumstances of its disclosure, the other party agrees to
protect such confidential information in a reasonable and appropriate manner,
and use confidential information only to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and for no other purpose. This will not apply to information which
is: (i) publicly known, (ii) already known to the recipient, (iii) lawfully
disclosed by a third party, (iv) independently developed or (v) disclosed
pursuant to legal requirement or order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
information (whether or not designated as confidential) may be provided to the
Valuation Firm without being made available to all parties in accordance with
the requirements of this Agreement and this _Exhibit E_. The Valuation Firm
shall not publicly disclose that it has been retained to resolve any dispute
relating to this Agreement or that it is involved in the dispute, or any
information relating to the dispute.

 



 

At the conclusion of the engagement contemplated hereby, confidential
information made available hereunder, including copies thereof, shall be
returned or destroyed upon request by the disclosing party.

 



 

 _Other Procedural Matters_

 



 

Procedural matters for the conduct of the dispute resolution, other than as
specified herein, will be determined by the Valuation Firm in consultation
with the Purchaser and the Representative; _provided_ , however, that any such
procedural matters shall in all cases be consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and this _Exhibit E_.

 



 

 _Conflicts of Interest_

 



 

Except in connection with the dispute being resolved with respect to this
Agreement, during the term of this engagement, neither the Valuation Firm nor
any member of the Valuation Firms team may work on any matters related to the
Purchaser, the Representative, the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates (or such Affiliates portfolio companies) or Subsidiaries or
otherwise perform services to any entity or individual that may present a
conflict of interest that could reasonably affect the Valuation Firms
services or the unbiased performance of services by any member of the
Valuation Firms team. The foregoing restrictions on the Valuation Firm will
not apply to employees of the Valuation Firm not assigned to work on this
engagement.
