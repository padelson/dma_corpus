(b) Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 1.1(a), the

(c) Assumption of Certain Liabilities by the Buyers. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the St. Maarten Buyer or the
U.S. Buyer, as applicable, shall assume and agree to pay, discharge and
perform, as appropriate, only those Liabilities of the Sellers specifically
indentified on Schedule 1.1(c) (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities").

  

  

(d) Retained Liabilities of the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, neither the Buyers nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall assume or in any way become liable for any Liabilities of any nature
whatsoever of the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Assumed
Liabilities), whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether
known or unknown, whether due or to become due, whether related to the
Business or the Purchased Assets and regardless of when or by whom asserted
(the "Retained Liabilities"). The Sellers acknowledge that the Retained
Liabilities are being retained by each of the Sellers or their Affiliates, as
applicable, who shall remain liable therefore, as applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, any and all Taxes asserted against, resulting to, imposed
upon or suffered (i) by the Sellers or (ii) by any Buyer Indemnified Parties
attributable to any of the Purchased Assets with respect to all periods (or
portions thereof) prior to the Closing shall be Retained Liabilities.

  

  

Section 1.2 Consideration.

  

  

(a) In consideration for the Purchased Assets, the applicable Buyer shall pay
to the applicable AUC Entity (or its authorized designee), an aggregate
purchase price equal to Two Hundred and Thirty Five Million Dollars
($235,000,000) (as adjusted in accordance with Section 1.3, the "Purchase
Price"), to be allocated among the Buyers and the AUC Entities as set forth on
Schedule 1.2 attached hereto (the "Purchase Price Schedule").

  

  

(b) In addition, as reimbursement of the AUC Entities' costs for providing the
Buyers with the services contemplated by Section 5.12(a) for the thirty (30)
day period following the Closing Date, the St. Maarten Buyer shall pay to
AUCNV, at the Closing, an amount equal to $ $693,341 (the "Transition
Payment").

  

  

Section 1.3 Net Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Model Statement; Estimated Net Working Capital. Schedule 1.3(a) attached
hereto sets forth (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the AUC Entities (other
than MEIO) as of March 31, 2011, which includes a detailed calculation of the
Net Working Capital as of March 31, 2011, together with the accounting
conventions used in determining the Net Working Capital (the "Model
Statement") and (ii) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the AUC
Entities (other than MEIO) as of the Closing Date, which includes a detailed
calculation of an estimate of the Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital") as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Working Capital
Statement").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Final Net Working Capital.

  

  

(i) No later than ten (10) days after the Closing Date, the Sellers will
deliver to the Buyers the consolidated balance sheet of the AUC Entities
(other than MEIO) as of the Closing Date (the "Seller Closing Balance Sheet").
The Seller Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the same
accounting methodologies, principles and procedures used in, and on a basis
consistent with, those applied by the AUC Entities (other than MEIO) in
preparing the Interim Financial Statements and the Model Statement (including
calculating reserves in accordance with the same methodology used to calculate
such reserves in preparation of the Interim Financial Statements and the Model
Statement) and in accordance with GAAP, as modified in accordance with the
accounting conventions and procedures set forth on Schedule 1.3(a). No later
than fifty (50) days after receipt of the Seller Closing Balance Sheet, the
Buyers will deliver to the Sellers the Buyers' calculation of the Net Working
Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Statement"). After delivery of
the Closing Statement, the Sellers and their accountants shall be permitted to
review and copy the work papers of the Buyers and their accountants related to
the preparation of the Closing Statement and make other reasonable inquiries
of the Buyers and their accountants regarding questions concerning or
disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of its review
thereof. If the Sellers have any objections to the Closing Statement, then the
Sellers shall deliver to the Buyers a statement (an "Objection Statement")
setting forth their disputes or objections (the "Objection Disputes") to the
Closing Statement and, to the extent practical, the Sellers' proposed
resolution of each such Objection Dispute. If an Objection Statement is not
delivered to the Buyers within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing
Statement, then the Closing Statement as originally delivered by the Buyers
shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties. If an Objection
Statement is timely delivered, then the Buyers and the Sellers shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve any Objection Disputes, but if they do not reach a
final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objection
Statement, the Seller and the Buyers shall submit each unresolved Objection
Dispute to KPMG LLP (the "Independent Auditor") to resolve such Objection
Disputes. The Independent Auditor shall be instructed to set forth a procedure
to provide for prompt resolution of any unresolved Objection Disputes and, in
any event, to make its determination in respect of such Objection Disputes
within thirty (30) days following its retention. The Independent Auditor's
determination of such Objection Disputes shall be final, binding and non-
appealable upon the Parties; provided, however, that no such determination
with respect to any item reflected in the Objection Statement shall be any
more favorable to the Buyers than is set forth in the Closing Statement or any
more favorable to the Sellers than is proposed in the Objection Statement. All
fees and costs of the Independent Auditor, if any, shall be paid equally by
(x) the Sellers, jointly and severally, if the Net Working Capital after
taking into account the adjustments made by the Independent Auditor is closer
to the Net Working Capital calculation set forth in the Closing Statement, or
(y) by the Buyer, if the Net Working Capital after taking into account the
adjustments made by the Independent Auditor is closer to the Net Working
Capital calculation set forth in the Objection Statement. The process set
forth in this Section 1.3(b)(i) shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties
for any disputes related to items required to be reflected on the Closing
Statement, whether or not the underlying facts and circumstances constitute a
breach of any representations or warranties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) If the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date, as finally determined
pursuant to clause (i) above, is greater than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then the Buyers shall promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days of the final determination thereof) pay to the Sellers,
collectively, such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated by the Sellers. If the Net Working Capital,
as finally determined pursuant to clause (i) above, is less than the Estimated
Net Working Capital, then the Buyers shall be entitled to receive the amount
of such deficiency, first from the Working Capital Escrow Funds, and second
from the General Escrow Funds, all in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(c) Preparation of Closing Statement. The Closing Statement (and all
calculations of Working Capital Assets, Working Capital Liabilities and Net
Working Capital) shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with the same
accounting methodologies, principles and procedures used in, and on a basis
consistent with, those applied by the AUC Entities in preparing the Interim
Financial Statements and the Model Statement (including calculating reserves
in accordance with the same methodology used to calculate such reserves in
preparation of the Interim Financial Statements and Model Statement) and in
accordance with GAAP, as modified in accordance with the accounting
conventions and procedures set forth on Schedule 1.3(a), except that the
Closing Statement shall (i) not include any purchase accounting or other
adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) be based on facts and circumstances as they exist on
the Closing Date and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or event
occurring after the Closing.

  

  

(d) Cooperation. Following the Closing, the Parties shall, and shall cause
their respective officers, employees, consultants, accountants, agents and
other Affiliates to, cooperate reasonably with each other Party and their
accountants in connection with their review of the Closing Statement and the
preparation of the Objection Statement and to provide any information
reasonably requested by such Party and their accountants in connection
therewith or in connection with resolving any Objection Dispute.

  

  

Section 1.4 Escrow. Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Funds shall be available to the Buyers in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Funds will be held as a
trust fund and, except as required by Law, will not be subject to any Lien,
attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of
any Party.

conditions, events or incidents, including the presence, generation,
manufacture, production, transportation, importation, use, treatment,

Transferred Leased Real Property lease has been sent or received by any
Seller. The Sellers have made available to the Buyers in the Dataroom true,
complete and correct copies of each of such leases. No AUC Entity is in
default of any Transferred Lease Real Property lease, and to the Knowledge of
the Sellers, no counterparty to any such lease is in default under any of such
leases. All rent and other amounts due and payable with respect to the leases
described in Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule have been paid through

agreement or understanding, and to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there has
been no organized effort by any labor union during the three (3) years prior

Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of each Benefit Plan.

  

  

(b) Each Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
as to its qualification and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no event has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in disqualification of
such Benefit Plan. Each of the Benefit Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. No Liability under Title IV of
ERISA has been incurred by any of the AUC Entities or any ERISA Affiliate of
any of the AUC Entities that has not been satisfied in full (other than with
respect to amounts not yet due), and no condition exists that presents a risk
to any of the AUC Entities or any ERISA Affiliate of any of the AUC Entities
of incurring a Liability thereunder. All contributions or other amounts
payable by any of the AUC Entities as of the date hereof with respect to each
Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have, in all material
respects, been paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP. None of the AUC
Entities has engaged in a transaction in connection with which any such Seller
reasonably would be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or
4976 of the Code. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened claims by or on behalf of any of the Benefit Plans, by any employee
or beneficiary covered under any Benefit Plan or otherwise involving any
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). No Benefit Plan is a
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a
multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA and
no Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) No Benefit Plan provides benefits, including death or medical benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees or
directors of the Sellers beyond their retirement or other termination of
service, other than (i) coverage mandated solely by applicable Law; (ii) death
benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension plan" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA); (iii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as
Liabilities on the books of any of the AUC Entities; or (iv) benefits the full
costs of which are borne by the current or former employee or director or his
or her beneficiary.

  

  

(d) None of the negotiation or the execution of this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (alone or in conjunction with any other event, including any
termination of employment on or following the Closing Date) will (i) entitle
any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of
any of the AUC Entities to any compensation or benefit; (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any
compensation or benefits or trigger any other obligation under any Benefit
Plan; or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, default under or limit
any AUC Entity's right to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan.

  

  

(e) No amount or other entitlement that could be received as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in conjunction with any other
event) by any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) will constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code). No director, officer, employee or independent
contractor of AUCNV or any subsidiary of any of the AUC Entities is entitled
to receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason of the tax required by
Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being imposed on such Person.

  

  

(f) With respect to each Benefit Plan established or maintained outside of the
U.S. primarily for the benefit of employees of any of the AUC Entities
residing outside of the U.S. (a "Foreign Benefit Plan"): (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan required by Law or by the
terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued,
in accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the Liability of each insurer
for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations with respect to all current and former participants in such plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan and no
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) each
Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered with a Governmental Authority
has been so registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable Law.

Disclosure Schedule:

  

  

(a) Each of the AUC Entities have timely paid all Taxes which will have been
required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof, the non-payment of which

(b) Each of the AUC Entities will have either (i) paid all Taxes required to
have been paid or (ii) with respect only to Taxes that are not covered by the

on any Purchased Asset, would otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Business or would result in the Buyers becoming liable therefor.

audits, actions, suits, proceedings, investigations, claims or other

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and terminating on the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), the Sellers,
Dr. Paul S. Tien and Yife Tien (collectively, with their respective
Affiliates, the "Restricted Persons") agree that they shall not, and shall

interest in, manage, control, participate in (whether as a partner,

in the Restricted Business; (ii) consult with, or provide services to, any
Person on any matters included within the definition of Restricted Business;

(iv) solicit, divert, entice or otherwise take away any Transferred
Individuals; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the
Restricted Persons, in the aggregate, from being passive owners of not more
than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding stock of any class of a Person which
is publicly traded so long as none of such Restricted Persons has any active
participation in the business of such Person.

  

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Restricted Business" means,
collectively, (i) the business of operating any allopathic medical school
(other than the Institution, if either Dr. Paul S. Tien or Yife Tien remain in
its employ) in South America, Central America or the islands and territories

(c) If, at the time of enforcement of the provisions of this Section 5.7, a
court or an arbitration award shall hold or determine that the duration, scope
or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then
existing, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area
reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated
duration, scope or area. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Parties against any breach of
the provisions of this Section 5.7, and, without prejudice to any other rights
and remedies otherwise available to the Buyers, each of the Sellers, Dr. Paul
Tien and Yife Tien agrees that the Buyers may seek injunctive relief to
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.7.

  

  

(d) Each of the Sellers, Dr. Paul Tien and Yife Tien hereby acknowledges that
it and its Affiliates are familiar with the trade secrets and other
confidential information relating to the Business. Each of the Sellers, Dr.
Paul Tien and Yife Tien acknowledges and agrees that Buyers would be
irreparably damaged if any Restricted Person were to breach the covenants
contained in this Section 5.7. Each of the Sellers, Dr. Paul Tien and Yife
Tien further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set
forth in Section 5.7 were a material inducement to the Buyers entering into
this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and that the Buyers
would not fully obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement
as specifically negotiated by the Parties hereto if any of the Sellers, Dr.
Paul Tien or Yife Tien breached the provisions of this Section 5.7.

  

  

(e) From and after the Closing, Yife Tien shall prevent Rocky Vista University

respect to the Transfer Taxes. The Buyers agree to cooperate with the Sellers
at the Sellers' expense in the filing of any returns with respect to the

Section 5.9 Post-Closing Assignment. Following the Closing, to the extent that
any of the Purchased Assets have not been assigned, transferred or otherwise
conveyed to the Buyers as of the Closing (each, a "Post-Closing Assignment"),
at the request of the Buyers or upon discovery by the Sellers, the Sellers
shall, or, as applicable, shall cause the other applicable AUC Entity to,
execute and deliver such instruments and take such action as the Buyers may
reasonably determine is necessary to transfer, convey and assign such assets
to the Buyers and to confirm the Buyers' title to or interest in the Purchased
Assets, to confirm the Buyers' ownership over the Purchased Assets and put the
Buyers (or the Buyers' Affiliates) in actual possession and operating control
thereof and to assist the Buyers (or the Buyers' Affiliates) in exercising all
rights with respect thereto; provided, however, with respect to any Purchased
Asset that is not assigned, transferred or conveyed to the Buyers at the
Closing on account of the fact that such assignment, transfer or conveyance is
not permitted or is not permitted without the consent of any third party (a
"Nonassigned Asset"), this Agreement nor any other Transaction Document shall
not be deemed to constitute an assignment of any such Nonassigned Asset, if
such consent is not given or if such assignment, transfer or conveyance
otherwise would constitute a breach of, or cause a loss of contractual
benefits under, any such Nonassigned Asset, and the Buyers shall assume no
obligations or liabilities thereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers will, and will cause the other AUC
Entities to, use their best efforts to obtain any consent required to assign
any Nonassigned Asset, without any conditions to such transfer or changes or
modifications of terms thereunder, and if any such consent cannot be obtained,
the Sellers will, or, as applicable, will cause the other applicable AUC
Entity to, provide for the Buyers any arrangement reasonably requested by the
Buyers intended to provide the Buyers with all of the benefits of such
Purchased Asset, including entering into a sublease or subcontract on the same
terms and conditions as the underlying contract or bringing appropriate legal
action seeking to enforce for the benefit of the Buyers any and all rights of
the AUC Entities against the other party or parties to any such Nonassigned
Asset for which consent is not obtained by the AUC Entities. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyers acknowledge and
agree that, (a) to the extent the Buyers (or any of the Buyers' Affiliates)
incur only immaterial Losses as a result of a Post-Closing Assignment of any
non-material Purchased Asset or Nonassigned Asset and the AUC Entities
attempted in good faith to cause the pre-Closing assignment of all Purchased
Assets, the Buyers shall be precluded from seeking indemnification for any
breach of Section 4.4(b) as a result of such Post-Closing Assignment of a non-
material Purchased Asset or Nonassigned Asset and (b) in the event (i) that a
consent to assign a Purchased Asset or related approval has not been obtained
or is not transferable prior to the Closing, (ii) the requirement to obtain
such consent or approval has been disclosed in Section 4.5 of the Disclosure

(a) If any third party shall notify any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party (the "Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter (a
"Third Party Claim"), which may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Article VIII,
then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify each
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing, describing the claim, the amount
thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis of the claim; provided,
however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give any notice required
under this Section 8.4(a) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent, if at all, that such
Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced thereby.

  

  

(b) Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's expense, and, upon
agreeing in writing that it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third-Party Claim hereunder, at its option will have the
right at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-
Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the
Indemnifying Party be permitted to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim
if (A) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that such Third-Party Claim
may materially and adversely impact the reputation of such Indemnified Party
or one of its Affiliates or (B) such Third-Party Claim involves an Educational
Agency or an Educational Approval, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless the
Indemnifying Party shall (A) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out
of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such
settlement, (B) not encumber any of the material assets of any Indemnified
Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or
materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any
Indemnified Party's business and (C) obtain, as a condition of any settlement
or other resolution, a complete release of any Indemnified Party potentially
affected by such Third-Party Claim, in which case no consent will be required;
and provided, further that the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim (it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense and shall be liable solely for the costs and
expenses of counsel of its choice reasonable satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, except in those instances where counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party has a conflict of interest (based on the advice of counsel to this
effect), in which case then the Indemnifying Party shall pay the expenses of
both the Indemnified Party's counsel and the Indemnifying Party's counsel). An
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Indemnified Party informed of all material developments and events relating to
such Third Party Claims. The Indemnified Party will cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the review, investigation and defense of
any such claim, shall make available its personnel, and shall provide such
testimony and access to its books and records as is reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party in writing within twenty (20) days after the
receipt of the Indemnified Party's written notice of a claim of indemnity
hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the Third-Party
Claim, but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to
this Agreement.

Section 8.5 Determination of Losses. The amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification shall be reduced by the amounts of any Tax Benefits inuring to
the Indemnified Party on account of such Loss and any insurance proceeds
received by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith. If the Indemnified
Party receives a Tax Benefit after an indemnification payment is made to it,

specific performance in accordance with Section 10.9.

Section 10.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedule attached hereto), the other Transaction Documents and any
other documents delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto or thereto, contain
the entire understanding of the Parties in respect of their subject matter and

the Parties with respect to such subject matter, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits constitute a
part hereof as though set forth in full above.

  

  

Section 10.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties shall
pay their own fees and expenses, including their own counsel fees, incurred in
connection with this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.4 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
supplemented, canceled or discharged, except by written instrument executed by
the Buyers and the Sellers. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising,
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No
waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision, nor shall
any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between the Parties. No
extension of time for performance of any obligations or other acts hereunder
or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an extension of the time
for performance of any other obligations or any other acts.

  

  

Section 10.5 Binding Effect; Assignment. The rights and obligations of this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided
herein, the rights and obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned by
the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Buyer may assign all or any of its rights
and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of such Buyer and such Buyer may
assign its rights and obligations hereunder for collateral security purposes
to any lender providing financing to such Buyer or any Affiliate of such
Buyer; provided, however, that (a) such assignment shall not relieve such
Buyer of its obligations hereunder and (b) no Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall incur any Liability in connection with such assignment.

  

  

Section 10.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by means of facsimile and electronically transmitted
portable document format (pdf) signature pages), each of which shall be an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

  

  

Section 10.7 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
article, section, paragraph, clause, schedule or exhibit, such reference shall
be deemed to be to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings
contained herein and on the Disclosure Schedule are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.8 Governing Law; Service of Process. This Agreement shall be
construed in accordance with and governed for all purposes by the internal
substantive Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of
conflicts thereof, applicable to contracts executed and to be wholly performed
within such State. For the purpose of enforcing an arbitration award rendered
by the arbitrators pursuant to Section 10.9 (and solely for such purpose and
only for the benefit of the Parties and no other Person or in connection with
any dispute outside of this Agreement) the Sellers shall appoint an agent for
service of process in London, England and the Buyers shall appoint an agent
for service of process in Chicago, Illinois, and delivery to such agents shall
be made by an internationally recognized overnight commercial carrier service
(or such other means provided for under applicable Laws) and delivery to such
agents in compliance with this Section 10.8 shall be sufficient for all
purposes and each of the Parties shall be precluded from asserting a claim of
insufficient service of process if the Party's respective agent is properly
served pursuant to this Section 10.8. For purposes of this Section 10.8, each
of the Sellers, Dr. Paul S. Tien and Yife Tien initially appoint Prakash Patel
at Magwells Solicitors (or Magwells Solicitors, if Prakash Patel is unable to
accept service), at 6 Angel Gate, London, England, EC1V 2PB, as the agent for
service of process for each of the Sellers, Dr. Paul S. Tien and Yife Tien and
the Buyers initially appoint DeVry as the Buyers' agent for service of
process. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any change of such agent
in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section 10.1.

  

  

Section 10.9 Dispute Resolution.

  

  

(a) All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any other document or agreement executed and delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance hereof and
thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, that are not
resolved by mutual agreement, shall be resolved solely and exclusively by
binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
("AAA") in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules. The
arbitration shall be conducted in English by three (3) neutral arbitrators.
The Buyers shall nominate one (1) arbitrator and the Sellers, collectively,
shall nominate the second. The third arbitrator shall be selected by the first
two (2); provided, however, that if they do not make a selection within thirty
(30) days after the appointment of the second, then the third arbitrator shall
be selected by AAA under its standard selection procedures. The third
arbitrator shall act as chair. The arbitration shall take place in London,
England, or such other place as is mutually agreed by the Parties. Reasonable
discovery shall be permitted for the production of documents. Any discovery
disputes shall be resolved by the arbitrators. The Parties agree that they
will not seek the discovery procedures set forth in 28 U.S.C. §1782 and that
to initiate a request for such relief would constitute a breach of this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Any final arbitral award shall be in writing and shall state the reasons
for the award. It will be final and binding on the Parties and shall be
enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) All fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the
Buyers, on one hand, and by the Sellers, collectively, on the other hand,
unless the arbitrators shall in their award decide otherwise. Each Party shall
bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and preparation and
presentation of proof, unless the arbitrators shall in their award decide
otherwise.

  

  

(d) All arbitral proceedings shall be confidential and none of the Parties nor
the arbitrators may disclose the existence, content or results of any
arbitration without the prior written consent of all Parties and all
arbitrators, other than to enforce a final arbitral award.

  

  

(e) Any final arbitral award may be enforced anywhere in the world, but
particularly in the Southern District of New York, or in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, in accordance with the
Federal Arbitration Act. For the purpose of the enforcement of such final
arbitral award in New York only: each Party consents and submits to the
personal jurisdiction of such courts situated in New York and further waives
any claim or defense based on any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction,
improper venue, forum non conveniens or other similar challenge in such
courts, and waives trial by jury, to the extent permitted by law.

  

  

(f) This arbitration provision shall survive if this Agreement should be
adjudged null and void or should be canceled or terminated for any reason
(other than the mutual written consent of the Buyers and the Sellers).

  

  

Section 10.10 Specific Performance. Each of the Parties agrees that this
Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable
pursuant to its terms and that the Buyers and the Sellers would be irreparably
harmed if any of the provisions of the Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms and that monetary damages would not
provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other
remedy to which a non-breaching Party may be entitled at law, a non-breaching
Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (pursuant to Section 10.9)
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions hereof.

  

  

Section 10.11 Arm's Length Negotiations; Drafting. Each Party expressly
represents and warrants to the other Parties that before executing this
Agreement, such Party has fully informed itself of the terms, contents,
conditions and effects of this Agreement; such Party has relied solely and
completely upon its own judgment in executing this Agreement; such Party has
had the opportunity to seek and has obtained the advice of counsel before
executing this Agreement, which is the result of arm's length negotiations
conducted by and among the Parties and their respective counsel. This
Agreement shall be deemed drafted jointly by the Parties and nothing shall be
construed against one Party or another as the drafting Party.

  

  

Section 10.12 Confidentiality; Publicity. Except as may be required by Law, or
as otherwise permitted or expressly contemplated herein, no Party or its
respective Affiliates, employees, agents and representatives shall disclose to
any third party the existence of this Agreement or the subject matter or terms
hereof without the prior consent of the other Party other than to such Party's
attorneys, advisors, representatives, members or investors. No press release
or public announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein shall be issued or made by any Party without the approval
of the other Parties, unless required by Law (in the reasonable opinion of
counsel) in which case the other Parties shall have the right to review such
press release, announcement or communication prior to its issuance,
distribution or publication; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing,
after the Closing, the Buyers may issue a press release or public announcement
related to this Agreement in the form and substance substantially similar to
Exhibit I attached hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 10.13 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation or in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or a final arbitration award rendered by the
arbitrators pursuant to Section 10.9 declares that any term or provision
hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court or
arbitrators making such determination or award shall have the power to limit
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court or arbitrators do not
exercise the power granted to them in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

  

  

Section 10.14 No Third Party Beneficiaries; Indemnification for the Protection
of the Buyers. Other than as set forth in Article VIII, nothing expressed or
implied in this Agreement is intended, or will be construed, to confer upon or
give any Person, other than the signatories hereto, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, or result in
such other Person being deemed a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the prime Person
indemnified hereunder pursuant to Article VIII is the Buyers. In furtherance
of the foregoing, none of the Buyer Indemnified Parties (other than the
Buyers) may proceed against the Sellers, except through the Buyers and their
counsel, who shall be the sole party who may bring any enforcement action
against the Sellers on behalf of any and all of the other Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Buyers shall have the sole and absolute discretion to decide
whether any claims, if asserted, should be dismissed, settled, compromised or
pursued to their conclusion. Persons, other than the Buyers, stated as being
Buyer Indemnified Parties hereunder, are so stated solely in order to ensure
that, in the event that arbitral claims are asserted by the Buyers, on behalf
of such other Persons in accordance with the terms hereof, they are not met
with objections as to standing. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no
independent right in favor of any Buyer Indemnified Party, other than the
Buyers, to decide that any claim for indemnification against the Sellers may
be asserted under this Agreement.
