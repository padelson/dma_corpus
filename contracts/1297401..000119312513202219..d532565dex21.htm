iv.  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is entered into as of May 1, 2013 by and
among DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
ATV Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), AwesomenessTV, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Target_ "), and Brian Robbins, as Stockholders
Representative. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined
in _Exhibit A_ hereto.

 

RECITALS

 

A. The Board of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Target have
determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders that Parent acquire Target through the merger of Merger Sub with
and into Target (the " _Merger_ "), and in furtherance thereof, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, have approved this Agreement and the
Merger in accordance with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of
Target Stock and Vested Target Stock Options shall be converted into the right
to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

C. A portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable by Parent to the
Non-Dissenting Stockholders and holders of Vested Target Stock Options (the "
_Escrow Participants_ ") at the Closing in connection with the Merger shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent by Parent as partial security for the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement.

D. Target, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and
warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree
as follows:

SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION.

1.1. Merger of Merger Sub into Target. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.2), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Target, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. Target shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions
of the DGCL.

1.2. Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Cooley LLP, 1333 2nd Street, Suite 400, Santa Monica, California,
90401 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on a date to be designated by Parent and
Target, which shall be no later than the second (2nd) business day after the

 



1\.  satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than those conditions that by
their nature would be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such time and date as Parent
and Target may designate. The failure to consummate the Merger on the date and
time and at the place specified herein will not relieve any party to
this Agreement of any obligation under this Agreement. The date on which the
Closing actually takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_." Contemporaneously with or as promptly as practicable after
the Closing, a properly executed certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") conforming to the requirements of the DGCL shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective as of the time that the Certificate of Merger is filed and
accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other
time as Parent and Target shall agree and as shall be specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to read as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that Article I of the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is AwesomenessTV, Inc.";

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that each
reference to "ATV Acquisition Corp.," shall be changed to "AwesomenessTV,
Inc."; and

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be those Persons designated by Parent in its sole
discretion.

 

1.4. Conversion of Shares.

(a) _Conversion_. Subject to Sections 1.4(d), 1.6 and 1.10, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, Target or any stockholder of Target, each share of Target
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive from Parent, following the surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Target Stock in accordance with
Section 1.7, the following consideration:

(i) each share of Target Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub, Target or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or Target
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be canceled without payment of any consideration with respect to
such share;

(ii) each share of Target Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, for each share
of Target Common Stock into which such share of Target Preferred Stock is
convertible, the sum of: (A) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Amount
_plus_ (B) any cash disbursements required to be

 



2\.  paid in respect to Contingent Consideration, if any, pursuant to Section
1.9, plus (C) any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund
with respect to such share to the former holder thereof in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as and when such
disbursements are required to be made;

(iii) each share of Target Common Stock (other than shares of Target
Restricted Stock) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive, the sum of: (A) an amount in cash equal
to: the Per Share Amount _plus_ (B) any cash disbursements required to be paid
in respect to Contingent Consideration, if any, pursuant to Section 1.9, plus
(C) any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with
respect to such share to the former holder thereof in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as and when such
disbursements are required to be made; and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

The amount of cash, if any, that each stockholder of Target is entitled to
receive for the shares of Target Stock held by such stockholder shall be
rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed
after aggregating the cash amounts payable for all shares of each class
and series of Target Stock held by such stockholder.

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) The " _Closing Payment_ " shall mean an amount equal to: (A) $33,460,000;
_plus_ (B) the aggregate exercise price for all Vested Target Stock Options;
_minus_ (C) the Escrow Amount _minus_ (D) the aggregate amount of all
estimated Transaction Expenses as set forth in the Merger Consideration
Certificate.

 

(ii) The " _Escrow Amount_ " shall mean $4,125,000.

 

(iii) The " _Escrow Contribution Amount_ " means, with respect to each share
of Target Stock or each share of Target Stock subject to Vested Target Stock
Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount
determined by _dividing_ : (A) the Escrow Amount; _by_ (B) the Fully Diluted
Company Share Number.

 

(iv) The " _Fully Diluted Company Share Number_ " shall mean the _sum_ of,
without duplication: (A) the aggregate number of shares of Target Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including: (1) any
such shares issued pursuant to Target Stock Options exercised prior to the
Effective Time; and (2) any such shares issued pursuant to any Target
Preferred Stock converted prior to the Effective Time); _plus_ (B) the
aggregate number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
Target Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_plus_ (C) the aggregate number of shares of Target Common Stock purchasable
under or otherwise subject to Vested Target Stock Options outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(v) The " _Per Share Amount_ " shall be determined by _dividing_ : (A) the
Closing Payment;  _by_ (B) the Fully Diluted Company Share Number.

 



3\. (c) _Escrow Contribution_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be delivered to the Escrow Agent in cash:

(i) as a contribution to the Escrow Fund with respect to each share of
Target Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount
equal to the Escrow Contribution Amount applicable to such share of Target
Stock; and

(ii) as a contribution to the Escrow Fund with respect to each share of Target
Common Stock that is subject to a Vested Target Stock Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal to the
Escrow Contribution Amount applicable to such share of Target Common Stock.

The Escrow Fund: (A) shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement; (B) shall be
held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee
process or other judicial process of any creditor of any Person; and (C)
shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event that Target, at any time or from time to time
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, subject to Sections
4.2(e) and (f), declares or pays any dividend on Target Stock payable in
Target Stock or in any right to acquire Target Stock, or effects a subdivision
of the outstanding shares of Target Stock into a greater number of shares of
Target Stock, or in the event the outstanding shares of Target Stock shall be
combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser
number of shares of Target Stock, then the amounts payable in respect of
shares of Target Stock pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and the amounts payable in
respect of shares of Target Stock subject to Target Stock Options pursuant to
Section 1.5 shall be appropriately adjusted.

(e) _Effect on Target Stock_. Upon the Effective Time, each share of Target
Stock, shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing shares of
Target Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto.

1.5. Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock.

(a)  _Target Stock Options_. Prior to the Closing, Target shall cause each
unexercised Target Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) to be cancelled, terminated and
extinguished as of the Effective Time. Each unexercised Target Stock Option
that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after
giving effect to any acceleration of vesting set forth in the applicable stock
option agreement, including any amendments thereto, or other applicable
Target Employee Agreement or action taken by Targets Board of Directors prior
to the date hereof) (a " _Vested Target Stock Option_ ") shall be cancelled as
of the Effective Time, and converted into the right to receive, in respect of
each vested share of Target Common Stock then subject to such Vested Target
Stock Option, the sum of: (i) an amount in cash equal to: (A) the Per Share
Amount; _less_ (B) the exercise price per share of Target Common Stock
subject to such Vested Target Stock Option; _plus_ (ii) any cash disbursements
required to be paid in respect of Contingent

 



4\.  Consideration, if any, pursuant to Section 1.9, _plus_ (iii) any cash
disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with respect to such
share to the former holder of such Target Stock Option in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as and when such disbursements are
required to be made. All payments made pursuant to this Section 1.5(a) shall
be subject to withholding pursuant to Section 1.10. Target Stock Options that
are not Vested Target Stock Options shall be cancelled, terminated and
extinguished as of the Effective Time for no consideration. The installment
payments received by a holder of a Vested Target Stock Option under this
Section 1.5(a) are intended to be separate "payments" for purposes of Section
409A of the Code and the guidance and regulations thereunder (" _Section 409A_
"). Each holder of an outstanding Target Stock Option cancelled as provided
in this Section 1.5(a) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration specified in this Section 1.5(a)
without interest.

 

(b) _Target Restricted Stock_. Each share of Target Common Stock subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions (" _Target Restricted Stock_ ")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (which does not vest as a
result of the consummation of the Merger) shall be cancelled by Parent and
converted into the right to receive the amounts payable to a holder of a
share of Target Common Stock as provided in Section 1.4(a)(iii); provided,
however, that such amounts shall be (i) subject to substantially the same
terms, including the same vesting schedule, repurchase option and risk of
forfeiture and other conditions, and (ii) payable to the former holder of such
Target Restricted Stock in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to
such Restricted Stock, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Further Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall take all
necessary action, including amending the Target Stock Plan and/or obtaining
any necessary consents, to effect the provisions of this Section 1.5.

1.6. Dissenting Shares.

(a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Target Stock held by a holder who has
demanded and perfected such demand for appraisal of such holders shares of
Target Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and as of the Closing
has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holders right to such
appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
applicable Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by the DGCL. Parent shall be entitled to retain any Merger
Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending resolution
of the claims of such holders, and such holders shall not be entitled to any
portion thereof.

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 1.6(a), if any holder of shares of Target Stock who demands appraisal
of such holders shares under the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders right
to appraisal, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event,
whichever later occurs, such holders shares of Target Stock shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, promptly following the surrender of
the certificate or certificates, or the delivery of an affidavit of lost
certificate as described in Section 1.7(e), representing such shares of Target
Stock.

 



5\. (c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. Target shall give Parent: (i)
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Target Stock received
by Target, withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by Target; and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
appraisal. Target shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of shares of Target
Stock or offer to settle any such demands other than by operation of law or
pursuant to a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

1.7. Exchange of Certificates and Target Stock Options.

(a) _Payment Agent_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate
itself or designate a third-party to act as payment agent in the Merger (the "
_Payment Agent_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the cash consideration payable
pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.5 (excluding the Escrow Amount and any amounts
due after the Closing in respect of any Contingent Consideration). The cash
amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_." The Payment Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund
in the manner directed by Parent. Any interest or other income resulting from
the investment of such funds shall be the property of, and will be paid to,
Parent.

(b) _Letter of Transmittal  Capital Stock and Vested Target Stock
Options_. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall cause the
Payment Agent to mail to each record holder of Target Stock and to each holder
of outstanding unexercised Vested Target Stock Options, in each case
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of
Target Stock Certificates or unexercised Vested Target Stock Options for the
Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such Target Stock or
Target Stock Options. Upon the surrender to the Payment Agent of a Target
Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as described in
Section 1.7(e)), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably request, a
holder of such Target Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, if any,
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.4(a), and the
Target Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Upon the delivery to the Payment Agent of a duly executed and properly
completed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as Parent or the
Payment Agent may reasonably request, a holder of unexercised Vested Target
Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, if any, which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5, which Parent may
cause to be paid through the Surviving Corporations payroll agent in the
case of payments in respect of Vested Target Stock Options. From and after the
Effective Time, each Target Stock Certificate which prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Target Stock shall be deemed to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to
such shares, and a holder of each such Target Stock Certificate shall cease to
have any rights with respect to the shares of Target Stock
formerly represented thereby.

 



6\. (c) _Payments to Others_. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect
of shares of Target Stock converted pursuant to Section 1.4 is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Target Stock
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that Target
Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of Target
Stock Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of Target shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration of
transfers of shares of Target Stock thereafter on the records of Target. If,
after the Effective Time, certificates for shares of Target Stock (" _Target
Stock Certificates_ ") are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with
respect to such shares as provided for in Section 1.4. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on any Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of a
Target Stock Certificate which immediately before the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Target Stock.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Target Stock Certificate
representing shares of Target Stock converted in connection with the Merger
pursuant to Section 1.4 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Target Stock previously
represented by such Target Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Target Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit of loss and to deliver a bond (in such amount, form and with such
surety as the Payment Agent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliated party with respect to such Target Stock
Certificate.

(f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains undistributed as of the date that is 180 days after the Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and Persons who have not
theretofore completed Letters of Transmittal and, if applicable, surrendered
their Target Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the
portion of the Payment Fund payable with respect to the shares of Target Stock
previously represented by such Target Stock Certificates or the shares of
Target Stock subject to such Target Stock Options, without any interest
thereon.

(g)  _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Target Stock or Target Stock Options or to any other Person for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property law,
escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Target Stock or Target Stock Options three years after
the Effective Time, the expiration of the Escrow Period or the Contingent
Consideration Determination Date, as applicable (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent free and clear
of any Encumbrance.

 



7\. 1.8. Reserved.

 

1.9. Contingent Consideration. As contemplated in Section 1.4(a), each Escrow
Participant shall be entitled to receive, subject to Section 1.10, such
Escrow Participants Pro Rata Portion of each of the 2014 Contingent Amount
and the 2015 Contingent Amount, in each case payable in cash (such
consideration, collectively, the " _Contingent Consideration_ ").

(i) " _2014 Contingent Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the sum of (A)
$5,500,000, _plus_  (B) the product of the amount by which Adjusted EBITDA
for the calendar year 2014 exceeds $5,500,000 multiplied by eight (8), but
such product not to exceed $36,000,000, _plus_ (C) the product of the amount
by which Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year 2014 exceeds $10,000,000,
multiplied by four (4); _provided_ that (x) the 2014 Contingent Amount shall
be $0 (zero dollars) if the Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year 2014 is less
than $5,500,000 and (y) the 2014 Contingent Amount shall not exceed
$109,500,000.

(ii) " _2015 Contingent Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the sum of (A)
if the Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year 2014 equaled or exceeded
$5,500,000 _and_ the Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year 2015 equals or
exceeds $5,500,000, $5,500,000, _plus_ (B) if the Adjusted EBITDA for the
calendar year 2014 exceeded $10,000,000 _and_ the Adjusted EBITDA for the
calendar year 2015 is at least twenty percent (20%) higher than the Adjusted
EBITDA for calendar year 2014, the product of the amount by which the
Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year 2014 exceeded $10,000,000 multiplied by
four (4), _plus_ (C) if the Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year 2014 was at
least $4,000,000 but less than $5,500,000 _and_ the Adjusted EBITDA for the
calendar year 2015 is at least thirty percent (30%) higher than the Adjusted
EBITDA for the calendar year 2014, $11,000,000; _provided_ that the sum of the
2014 Contingent Amount and the 2015 Contingent Amount shall not
exceed $117,000,000.

(iii) " _Adjusted EBITDA_ " shall mean, for any applicable period, the amount
equal to (A) the consolidated net income attributable to the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries for such applicable period determined in
accordance with GAAP, _plus_ (B) without duplication and only to the extent
deducted in determining such consolidated net income of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the sum of (in each case, the applicable
amount for such applicable year to be determined in accordance with GAAP (1)
consolidated interest expense, (2) consolidated income Tax expense, (3)
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense, (4) all extraordinary non-
operating charges (including all Transaction Expenses and all charges
resulting from payments made in respect of Target Stock and Target Stock
Options pursuant to this Agreement), (5) non-cash foreign exchange,
translation or performance losses relating to any foreign currency hedging
transactions, (6) any compensation expense associated with the Target
Employee Bonus Plan, and (7) any expenses incurred by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Loss for which Parent
or any of its Affiliates has received indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2,  _minus_ (C) without duplication and only to the extent included in
determining such consolidated net income of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries for such applicable period, the sum of (in each case, the
applicable amount for such applicable year to be determined in accordance
with GAAP) (1) consolidated interest income, (2) consolidated income Tax
credits or refunds, (3) any

 



8\.  extraordinary non-operating gains, (4) any non-cash gains for such year that

(5) non-cash foreign exchange, translation or performance gains relating to
any foreign currency hedging transactions, and (6) any non-cash income or
gains resulting from fair value adjustments to contingent payment liabilities
recognized in connection with the Merger; provided, however, that in
calculating Adjusted EBITDA, no portion of any production funding received
from Google Inc. or any of its Affiliates that is unused shall be treated as
revenue or income to the extent inclusion of such funding would increase any
Contingent Amount; _provided, further_ , that in calculating Adjusted EBITDA,
that any revenue received by the Surviving Corporation in connection with
the agreements and/or projects set forth in _Schedule 1.9(a)(iii)(A)_ shall
not be counted as revenue whether or not such treatment would be consistent
with GAAP.

In addition, the following guidelines shall be applied when determining
Adjusted EBITDA:

a. No deduction shall be made for any intercompany charges (including
management fees), or for expenses or expense categories directly attributable
to Parents control of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, use of technology systems of Parent and its
Affiliates, implementation of Parents benefits plans and SEC reporting),
other than (A) expenses directly attributable to operating the business of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course as
reasonably determined by Parent, (B) any expenses or expense allocations for
general corporate services rendered by Parent or any of its Affiliates
consistent with Parents standard practices and agreed to by Brian Robbins
(acting in good faith), or (C) charges, expenses or expense categories that
have been agreed to by the Stockholders Representative (acting in
good faith).

b. No deduction shall be made for (i) compensation or other benefits paid to
the Persons set forth on  _Schedule 1.9(a)(iii)(B)_ under their employment
agreements with Parent in excess of the compensation expense for such Persons
set forth on budget for 2013, 2014 and 2015 previously provided to Parent, or
(ii) compensation or other benefits paid to any other employees or
contractors of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries), in any case unless such costs or
allocations have been agreed to by Brian Robbins (acting in good faith). 

c. No deduction shall be made for expenses associated with any employee of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries performing services substantially
for the benefit of Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) (e.g., travel expense related to services
provided substantially for the benefit of Parent and not the Surviving
Corporation).

d. No deduction shall be made for office rents or related expenses in excess
of those reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to support its operating requirements, unless such costs or
allocations have been agreed to by the Stockholders Representative (acting in
good faith).

 



9\. e. No deduction shall be made for amounts recovered by or expenses reimbursed
to any of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the indemnification provisions
of Section 9, or for expenditures by in connection with enforcement of or
otherwise related to this Agreement.

 

f. Parent may, after prior consultation with the Stockholders Representative
and upon at least ten (10) days prior notice, require the Surviving
Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary to use such resources, services
providers and/or insurance policies as Parent directs in substitution of, or
supplement to, such resources, service providers and/or insurance policies
being used at the time by the Surviving Corporation or the applicable
Subsidiary; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in
subsection a. above, the amount of such expenses included in the calculation
of Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period shall not exceed the historical
amount of the relevant eliminated expenses as set forth in Targets unaudited
statement of income for the most recently completed fiscal year plus three
percent (3%) per year commencing from the date of such action (pro-rated for
partial years).

(iv) " _Contingent Amounts_ " shall mean the 2014 Contingent Amount and the
2015 Contingent Amount, collectively.

(b) _Determination of Contingent Amounts_.

(i) _Contingent Consideration Statement_. Not later than 90 calendar days
following the last day of each of the calendar years 2014 and 2015, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare and deliver to the
Stockholders Representative a statement (each, a " _Contingent Consideration
Statement_ ") setting forth Parents calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA and
the resulting Contingent Amount for such calendar year, which shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable to individual
account balances used to determine such amounts) with such adjustments
thereto set forth in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and as set forth in
this Section 1.9, and including reasonable detail of the components thereof
and appropriate supporting documentation for each of the foregoing. During
the 60 calendar day period following receipt by the Stockholders
Representative of a Contingent Consideration Statement, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, provide reasonable access during normal business hours to and otherwise
make available to the Stockholders Representative and its Representatives the
relevant books and records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries,
including the accounting records, work papers, schedules and calculations
that were used in or otherwise applicable to a determination of the Adjusted
EBITDA and the Contingent Amount for such year, any of Parents independent
auditors work papers related to the calculation of such amounts (subject to
execution of standard release and/or other agreements required by Parents
independent auditors), and any other documents that may be reasonably
requested by the Stockholders Representative and its Representatives to
determine whether the calculations of the Adjusted EBITDA and the Contingent
Amount set forth in such Contingent Consideration Statement were made in
accordance with this Section 1.9, and reasonable access during
normal business hours to the employees and representatives of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent to respond to questions arising in such determination.

 



10.  (ii) _Contingent Consideration Notice of Disagreement_. The
Contingent Consideration Statement shall become final and binding upon
Parent, the Escrow Participants and the Stockholders Representative on the
earlier of (i) the Stockholders Representatives written acceptance thereof
and (ii) the 60th day following delivery thereof, unless the Stockholders
Representative gives written notice of its disagreement with the Contingent
Consideration Statement (a " _Contingent Consideration Notice
of Disagreement_ ") to Parent prior to such date. Each Contingent
Consideration Notice of Disagreement shall specify all items with which the
Stockholders Representative disagrees in sufficient detail for Parent to
understand the nature of the disagreement. Except as set forth in a
Contingent Consideration Notice of Disagreement, the Stockholders
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Contingent Consideration Statement. If the Stockholders
Representative does not deliver a Contingent Consideration Notice of
Disagreement within such 60 calendar day period, then the Contingent
Consideration Statement shall be deemed to be finally determined as set forth
in Parents calculation thereof. If a Contingent Consideration Notice of
Disagreement is received by Parent in a timely manner, then the Contingent
Consideration Statement (as revised in accordance with this Section 1.9) shall
become final and binding upon Parent, the Escrow Participants and the
Stockholders Representative on the earlier of (A) the date the Stockholders
Representative and Parent resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Contingent Consideration Notice of
Disagreement or (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in
writing by the Independent Auditors (subject to the right of Parent and the
Stockholders Representative to dispute any Non-Calculation Issues pursuant
to Section 10.7). During the 20 calendar day period following the delivery of
a Contingent Consideration Notice of Disagreement, the Stockholders
Representative and Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences
that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Contingent
Consideration Notice of Disagreement. All determinations and payments made
pursuant to any Contingent Consideration Statement shall be subject to
Section 1.9(i).

(iii) _Independent Auditors_. If Parent and the Stockholders Representative
are not able to resolve their differences during such 20 calendar day period
following the delivery of a Contingent Consideration Notice of Disagreement,
then at the end of such period, the Stockholders Representative and
Parent shall submit to the Independent Auditors for determination any and all
matters that remain in dispute solely with respect to the calculation of the
Adjusted EBITDA and the resulting Contingent Amount for the applicable year as
calculated from the Surviving Corporations books and records with such
adjustments thereto set forth in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and as set
forth in this Section 1.9, which matters shall be described in a written brief
delivered to the Independent Auditors. For the sake of clarity, unless
mutually agreed otherwise, Parent and the Stockholders Representative will
not submit to the Independent Auditors disputes relating to breaches of the
parties covenants and agreements in this Agreement (including this Section
1.9) other than Section 1.9(a)(iii) (collectively, the " _Non-Calculation
Issues_ "), and no determinations by the Independent Auditors will affect the
validity, timeliness or potential effect of any claims or assertions with
respect to Non-Calculation Issues. Parent and the Stockholders Representative
shall cooperate in good faith to agree upon the specific disagreements to be
submitted to the Independent Auditors, the method for submitting such
disagreements, applicable guidelines to govern communications with the
Independent Auditors and other procedural rules with respect to the
arbitration. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholders Representative shall make readily available to the

 



11.   Independent Auditors all relevant accounting books and records and any
accounting work papers (subject to execution of standard release and/or other
agreements required by Parents independent auditors) relating to the
Contingent Consideration Statement or the Contingent Consideration Notice of
Disagreement, the employees, accountants and other representatives of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders Representative, and all other
items reasonably requested by the Independent Auditors. In resolving the
differences with respect to matters specified in the Contingent Consideration
Notice of Disagreement, the Independent Auditors shall (A) consider only
those items or amounts disputed by the Stockholders Representative in the
Contingent Consideration Notice of Disagreement which remain in dispute; (B)
shall not assign a value to any item or amount in dispute greater than the
greatest value for such item or amount assigned by the Stockholders
Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, or less than
the smallest value for such item or amount assigned by the
Stockholders Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand;
and (C) shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Independent
Auditors shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative and Parent as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within 30 days of its retention) a
report setting forth its determination. Such report shall, upon delivery to
the Stockholders Representative and Parent and absent manifest error, be
final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders Representative, the
Escrow Participants and Parent with respect to the disputes resolved. The
costs, fees and other expenses of the Independent Auditors in connection with
the dispute resolution process set forth in this Section 1.9 shall be borne
by Parent, on the one hand, and Escrow Participants, on the other hand, based
on the percentage which the portion of the disputed amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually disputed by such party, with the amount to
be paid by the Escrow Participants to be deducted from the Escrow Fund or, if
the Escrow Fund has been reduced to $0 (zero dollars), from any future
Contingent Amount payable to the Escrow Participants. All other fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the dispute resolution process set forth
in this Section 1.9, including fees and expenses of attorneys and accountants,
shall be borne and paid by the party incurring such expenses.

 

(c) _Payment of Contingent Consideration_. Subject to Section 1.9(f), no later
than five (5) business days following the earlier of the date on which a
Contingent Consideration Statement for a particular year becomes final and
binding upon the Parties (a " _Contingent Consideration Determination Date_
"), Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent for distribution to each
Escrow Participant its Pro Rata Portion of a cash amount equal to the
Contingent Amount for such year, _minus_ any Transaction Expenses payable to
any broker, finder or investment banker or attributable to payments that may
arise under the Target Employee Bonus Plan in respect of such Contingent
Amount, _minus_ any amounts subject to any right to setoff expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or any Letter of Transmittal, _minus_
any unreimbursed Stockholders Representative Expenses (the " _Net Contingent
Payment_ "), which amount may be subject to withholding in accordance with
Section 1.10. Parent shall pay the Stockholders Representative any
unreimbursed Stockholders Representative Expenses and shall cause the Payment
Agent to distribute the Net Contingent Payment to each Escrow Participant as
promptly as possible.

 

(d) _Parent Covenants_. From the Effective Time through December 31, 2015,
except to the extent the Stockholders Representative has granted its prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed):

 

(i) Parent, or its successor in the event of a merger or similar transaction
of Parent in which Parent is not the surviving corporation, shall not cease,
directly or indirectly, to be the beneficial owner of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 



12.  (ii) Parent shall not, unless required by applicable law, commence a
dissolution, winding up or other insolvency procedure with respect to the
Surviving Corporation;

(iii) Brian Robbins shall continue to remain responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (unless he is
unable due to his death or disability or he is terminated for Cause (as
defined in the applicable Employment Agreement) or voluntarily terminates his
employment with the Surviving Corporation without Good Reason (as defined in
the applicable Employment Agreement)) and shall have authority to direct the
day-to-day operations of the Surviving Corporation consistent with the
authority of similarly situated executives of Parent or its Affiliates;

(iv) Neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
enter into any agreement or transaction with Parent or any of its Affiliates
which provides for any payment for goods or services on terms less favorable
in the aggregate to the Surviving Corporation or relevant Subsidiary than
such terms as would reasonably be obtained from a third party on an arms
length basis.

(v) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall charge any management fees
or other similar charges to Surviving Corporation provided that the Surviving
Corporation may be allocated a charge for services rendered by Parent or any
of its Affiliates consistent with Parents standard practices;

(vi) Parent shall maintain the business conducted by Target and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, together with any new business developed
or acquired by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date, in all material respects as a separate business unit of Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent with distinct books and records to the extent
necessary to allow the determination of the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries; and

 

(vii) Parent and its Affiliates shall not relocate the headquarters of the
Surviving Corporation to a location outside of the County of Los Angeles,
California (" _LA County_ "), and shall maintain sufficient functionality in
such LA County office(s). Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall require,
directly or through the Surviving Corporation, as a condition to continued
employment or the maintenance or receipt of any employment-related benefit,
that the workplace of any employee of the Surviving Corporation located in LA
County as of the Closing Date be located outside of LA County. 

(e) _Artificial Actions_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates shall voluntarily do or omit to do any act to deliberately
frustrate or prejudice the amount of revenues or profits which the Surviving
Corporation would otherwise achieve through December 31, 2015 or to otherwise
intentionally manipulate Adjusted EBITDA to increase or decrease Contingent
Consideration contrary to the spirit and intent of this Section 1.9.

 



13.  (f) _Parent Control_. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in
this Section 1.9 shall restrict Parents right to control the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries in any respect, including the following: the
hiring or termination of employees, consultants or other service providers;
the license of content, technology or intellectual property; the entering
into, modifying or terminating of agreements relating to distribution and
exploitation of content, the offering or ceasing to offer particular products,
services, lines of business, promotions, payment methods, or other aspects of
Targets current business or operations; the incurrence of expenses and
requiring compliance with Parents and its Affiliates internal controls,
corporate governance policies and procedures, legal and regulatory compliance
standards (including with respect to any changes in Legal Requirements that
may affect the websites and means of distribution utilized by the Surviving
Corporation) and consumer data guidelines and privacy rules and regulations;
or changes to the Surviving Corporations capital structure or debt structure;
provided, however, that the Parties understand that the Escrow Participants
shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available to such Escrow
Participants at law or in equity in the event that Parent or any of its
Affiliates breaches the covenants and agreements of Parent in this Section
1.9.

(g) _Breaches of Parent Covenants_.

(i) In the event that Parent materially breaches any of the covenants set
forth in Section 1.9(d) from the Effective Time through December 31, 2015 and
such breach, if capable of cure, is not cured within 30 days of Parent
becoming aware of such breach (a " _Parent Breach_ "), Adjusted EBITDA for
calendar 2014 and calendar 2015 shall equal the greater of (A) the actual
Adjusted EBITDA for the given year and (B) the Alternate Adjusted EBITDA (as
defined below) for the given year. In addition to the foregoing, the Parties
understand that the Escrow Participants shall be entitled to all rights and
remedies available to such Escrow Participants at law or in equity in the
event that Parent or any of its Affiliates breaches the covenants and
agreements of Parent in this Section 1.9.

(ii) " _Alternate Adjusted EBITDA_ " means, for any calendar year, (A) if the
Parent Breach occurred during such year, an amount equal to the Adjusted
EBITDA for the year to date at the time of such Parent Breach, prorated for
the entirety of such year based on the number of days elapsed in such year
relative to the number of days remaining in such year and (B) if the Parent
Breach did not occur during such year, the Adjusted EBITDA (or the Alternate
Adjusted EBITDA, if greater) for the prior calendar year _multiplied by_ one-
hundred and thirty percent (130%).

(h) _Limited Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (A) will be under
any obligation or have any duty to act in such a manner that the Contingent
Amounts are paid or, if payable, maximized, (B) will owe any Escrow
Participant any fiduciary or other similar duty in respect of this Section 1.9
or (C) will have any obligation or be bound by any agreement or covenant of
any kind in respect of this Section 1.9, other than, for each of clauses
(A)-(C), an obligation to comply with (x) the covenants and agreements
expressly set forth in this Section 1.9 and (y) the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing implied in all contracts governed by Delaware Law, it being the
intention of Parent, Target, the Escrow Participants and the Stockholders
Representative that all other covenants, agreements and/or obligations related
to the subject

  



14.   matter of this Section 1.9 are expressly waived and disclaimed. Without
limiting the obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholders Representative set forth in this Section 1.9, the parties to
this Agreement expressly acknowledge that (I) Parent currently operates a
diverse entertainment content production, operation and distribution business,
(II) Parent intends to continue operating its existing business and may
acquire and/or develop other offline and online businesses in the future, and
(III) such actions shall not be deemed to interfere with or impede the ability
of the Escrow Participants to achieve or maximize the
Contingent Consideration.

(i) _Non-Assignability_. The interests, if any, of any Escrow Participant in
such Escrow Participants portion of the Contingent Amounts pursuant to this
Section 1.9 shall not be assignable or transferable, except by operation of
law; _provided_ that any Escrow Participant which is an entity may assign its
rights to its equityholders in proportion to their equity interests in the
entity (it being understood that any attempted assignment or transfer in
violation of this Section 1.9(h) shall be null and void). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Contingent Amount that becomes payable at or after the death
of a Escrow Participant who is an individual shall be paid to the Escrow
Participants beneficiary or beneficiaries named in the most recent
designation that the Escrow Participant filed with the Stockholders
Representative prior to the Escrow Participants death or, if not so
designated, to the Escrow Participants estate.

(j) _Clawback for Fraud or Intentional Misconduct_. For a period of one year
after a Contingent Consideration Determination Date, the Net Contingent
Payment determined as of such date and paid to any Escrow Participant shall
be subject to clawback by Parent if (i) the calculation of such Net Contingent
Payment was based on a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA that was inaccurate and
(ii) such inaccuracy is attributable to fraud or intentional misconduct of
any employee of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. Upon any
such determination, Parent shall be entitled to (x) cause each Escrow
Participant that both is a current employee of Target as of the date hereof
and was involved in such fraud or intentional misconduct to return to Parent
the cash received by such Escrow Participant for the portion of the Net
Contingent Payment attributable to the inaccuracy giving rise to Parents
request and (y) offset against any future Net Contingent Payments payable to
any Escrow Participant (irrespective of a Escrow Participants involvement in
such fraud or intentional misconduct), a portion of the Net Contingent Payment
attributable to the inaccuracy giving rise to Parents request.

1.10. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Target Stock or
Target Stock Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

1.11. Transaction Expenses. At Closing, Parent shall pay or cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay all Transaction Expenses specified in the Merger
Consideration Certificate.

 



15.  1.12. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and Target, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of Target and otherwise) to take such action.

controls and an assignment in gross without the accompanying goodwill) has
occurred or exists that has resulted in the abandonment of any
trademark (whether registered or unregistered) owned, used, or applied for by
Target or any of its Subsidiaries. None of the goodwill associated with or
inherent in any trademark (whether registered or unregistered) in which Target

and through the date of this Agreement.

Subsidiaries as an employee. Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has
ever had any temporary or leased employees. No independent contractor of

including (without limitation) ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to
such Target Employee Plan or Target Employee Agreement. All
contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be made or accrued as
of the date hereof to the Target Employee Plans have been timely made or
accrued. Each Target Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of
the Code has obtained a currently effective favorable determination
notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its
qualified status (or the qualified status of the master or prototype form on
which it is established) from the IRS covering the amendments to the Code
effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and all subsequent legislation for
which the IRS will currently issue such a letter, and nothing has occurred
since the date of such letter covering such Target Employee Plan that would
adversely affect such favorable determination.

(d) No plan currently or ever in the past maintained, sponsored, contributed
to or required to be contributed to by Target or any of its current or former
ERISA Affiliates is or

standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, or (v) a plan
maintained in connection with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code. The term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any Person that, together with
Target, would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

 

(e) No Proceeding (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary

of Labor, or other Governmental Authority with respect to any Target Employee
Plan. No "Prohibited Transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the

408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Target Employee Plan.

(f) No Target Employee Plan or Target Employee Agreement provides, or
reflects or represents any liability to provide, benefits (including, without
limitation, death or medical benefits), whether or not insured, with respect
to any former or current employee, or any spouse or dependent of any such
employee, beyond the employees retirement or other termination of employment
with Target other than coverage mandated by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4980B of the Code or similar law.

 

(g) Except as set forth in _Part 2.18(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the transactions
contemplated herein (either alone or in combination with any other event) will
(i) result in any payment becoming due to any Target Employee under any Target
Employee Plan or Target Employee Agreement, (ii) increase any benefits under
any Target Employee Plan or Target Employee Agreement; or (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit
under any Target Employee Plan or Target Employee Agreement.

the jurisdiction of the United States, or covers any employee residing or
working outside the United States.

all times have been in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws (as defined below), which compliance includes the
possession by Target or its Subsidiaries of all permits and

that all such written consents are solicited and obtained in full compliance
with all applicable Legal Requirements and with the fiduciary duties of
Targets Board of Directors.

 

5.3. Public Announcements. From and after the date of this Agreement, except

co-payment amounts paid under Targets medical, vision and dental plans in
respect of the plan year in which the Closing occurs. Nothing in this Section
5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall (x) constitute or be deemed to be an
amendment to any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, or prevent

Employee Bonus Plan, (ii) make all payments required by the Target Employee
Bonus Plan concurrently with the corresponding payments required to be made to
the Escrow Participants hereunder and (iii) comply with the terms of the

satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code, Parent

47.   payment by such holders of Target Stock of a portion of the Merger
Consideration to which they are otherwise entitled to such party set forth on
_Schedule 5.7_ , in the circumstances, and subject to the conditions, set
forth therein. Target and, upon delivery of their respective Letters of
Transmittal, such holders of Target Stock, hereby direct Parent to pay or
cause to be paid on behalf of such holders of Target Stock all
amounts required to be paid to the party set forth on _Schedule 5.7_ and to
deduct such amounts from the portions of the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to such holders of Target Stock hereunder in accordance with such
agreement with the party set forth on _Schedule 5.7_ in the event it is
entered into.

5.8. Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of Target and its Subsidiaries against any Losses incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that Target or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, would have
been permitted under its Charter Documents and Legal Requirements in effect on
the date hereof to indemnify such director or officer (including the
advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements), provided that, if required by Legal
Requirements, the director or officer to whom such expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to the Surviving Corporation to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. For seven (7) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect directors and
officers liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered
by the Surviving Corporations directors and officers liability insurance
policy on terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such existing
insurance coverage. Parent and Target shall each bear one-half of the cost
associated with obtaining such directors and officers liability insurance.

each an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall severally and _pro rata_ based upon
the amount of Merger Consideration payable to such Escrow Participant
(as compared with the Merger Consideration payable to all Escrow
Participants) indemnify and hold Parent and its officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, attorneys, agents and Affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and each
an " _Indemnified Party_ "), harmless from, against and in respect of, and
shall compensate and reimburse the Indemnified Parties for, any and all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, fees, fines, deficiencies, judgments,
settlements, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses of investigation and defense but excluding punitive or consequential
damages (individually, a " _Loss_ " and, collectively, " _Losses_ "),
incurred, sustained or accrued by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them,
directly or indirectly (whether or not arising from a third party claim), as a
result of, arising out of or relating to:

a. any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Target in this Agreement;

b. any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in

in accordance with Section 1.4 hereof.

(ii) For the purpose of this Section 9 only, when determining the amount of
any Losses incurred as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty, any representation or warranty given or made by Target that is
qualified in scope as to materiality (including "Material Adverse Effect")
shall be deemed to be made or given without such qualification and no effect
shall be given to any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule
made or purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement.
Such references shall be respected, and shall not be disregarded, for purposes
of determining whether there is any inaccuracy in, or whether any of the
Parties have breached, any representation, warranty or certificate.
The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution from, and
may not seek indemnification or advancement of expenses from, Target, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any Loss claimed by an
Indemnified Party.

 



54.  (b) _Cap_. The aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to
this Section 9.2 shall be limited to the Escrow Amount and, to the extent the
Escrow Amount is exhausted, up to twelve and one half percent (12.5%) of any
Contingent Amounts (collectively, the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Cap shall not apply to any and all Losses arising,
directly or indirectly (i) from any breach or inaccuracy in the Specified
Representations, in each case the aggregate liability of any Escrow
Participant for which shall be limited to the aggregate proceeds actually
received by such Escrow Participant, (ii) claims for indemnification pursuant
to paragraphs "b", "c" (except with respect to a breach of Section 4.3), "d"
or "e" of Section 9.2(a)(i), or (iii) from fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach of this Agreement. The total amount of
indemnification payments that each Escrow Participant that did not commit any
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach of this Agreement can
be required to make to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2 shall
be limited to the aggregate Merger Consideration such Escrow Participant
received (before deduction of any applicable Taxes) (it being understood that
there shall be no limitation on the liability of any Escrow Participant that
committed any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach of this
Agreement).

 

(c) _Threshold Amount_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover Losses with respect to
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty (other than any
Specified Representation) made by Target or any breach of Section 4.3 by
Target until the total of all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Parties
exceeds, on a cumulative basis, $500,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in
which case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover only the
Losses that exceed the Threshold Amount.

 

(d) _Officer s Certificate_. For purposes hereof, " _Officer s Certificate_"
shall mean a certificate signed by any Indemnified Party (i) stating that the
Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred or accrued, or reasonably
anticipates that it will be required to pay, sustain, incur or accrue Losses,
and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the individual
items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was
paid, sustained, incurred or accrued (or the basis for such anticipated
liability), and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any Indemnified
Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss pursuant to this
Section 9 notwithstanding the fact that such Indemnified Party had Knowledge
of (or was capable of obtaining Knowledge of) the breach, event or
circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing.

 

9.3. Tax Indemnification.

(a) _Indemnification_. Each Escrow Participant shall severally and _pro rata_
based upon the amount of Merger Consideration payable to such Escrow
Participant (as compared with the Merger Consideration payable to all Escrow
Participants) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from, against
and in respect of any and all Losses attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the
non-payment thereof) of Target for all Taxable periods ending on or before

 



55.   the Closing Date and for the portion of any Straddle Period through the end
of the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which
Target is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local, or foreign Legal Requirement, (iii) any Taxes as a result of being a
transferee of or successor to any Person or as a result of any express or
implied obligation to assume such Taxes or to indemnify any other Person, (iv)
any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on Target or the Merger Sub as a
result of any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement, arrangement, or
understanding entered into on or prior to the Closing Date, (v) all employment
and other payroll Taxes incurred by Target or the Surviving Corporation in
respect of Target Employee Bonus Plan payments and payments to holders of
Vested Target Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.5(a), and (vi) their share
of transfer and similar Taxes described in subsection "(d)."

(b) _Straddle Period_. For any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), with respect to Taxes
measured by net income or gain, revenues or gross receipts, the Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of such Straddle Period
will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date. The amount of Taxes for a Straddle Period not
described in the preceding sentence which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
portion of such Straddle Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire taxable period (excluding any additional amounts resulting from
reassessments made with respect to transactions occurring on or after the
Closing Date) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements, Tax allocation
agreements or similar agreements and all powers of attorney with respect to or
involving Target will be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date and,
after the Closing, Target will not be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

 

(d) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording
charges incurred in connection with the Merger, will be borne equally by the
Escrow Participants, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. The
Escrow Participants, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will, at their own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Taxes, fees and charges if and as required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Escrow Participants will cooperate fully and promptly, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any of the other parties, in connection with any Tax
matters relating to Target and the Surviving Corporation including by the
provision of information and assistance, and access to books and records in
such partys possession, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns by Parent or the Stockholders Representative, the making of any
election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Tax authority
and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to
any Tax. Within thirty (30) days prior to the applicable filing deadline,
Parent will (i) provide to the Stockholders Representative a copy of each Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Escrow Participants would
have any liability pursuant to Section 9.3(a) above, and (ii) consider in good
faith and make any reasonable changes requested by the Stockholders
Representative.

 



56.  9.4. Set-Off. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 9, in addition
to any rights of setoff or other similar rights that any of the other
Indemnified Parties may have at common law or otherwise, Parent shall have the
right to withhold and deduct any sum that may be owed to any Indemnified Party
under this Section 9 from any amount otherwise payable by any Indemnifying
Party to any Indemnified Party.

9.5. Escrow Arrangements.

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and as
partial security for the indemnity obligations provided for in Section 9.2
and Section 9.3, on the Closing Date, the Escrow Amount shall be deposited
with the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 1.4(c). The Escrow Amount
shall constitute an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ "), to be governed by
the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall
be available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Parties for any claims by
such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they
are entitled to recovery under this Section 9\. Parent (on behalf of itself or
any other Parent Indemnified Party) agrees that it shall seek recovery first
from the Escrow Fund for any Losses for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, and if the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy such Losses or if a claim for indemnification is
validly made after the Survival Date, then Parent (on behalf of itself or
any other Parent Indemnified Party) shall be entitled to seek recovery
against up to twelve and one half percent (12.5%) of any Contingent Amounts,
and if such funds are insufficient to satisfy the Losses, then Parent (on
behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Party) shall be entitled,
subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(b), to seek recovery against the
Indemnifying Parties directly severally and pro rata based upon the amount of
Merger Consideration payable to such Indemnifying Parties.

(b) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods_. Subject
to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Closing and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., local time
on the Survival Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "); provided, however, that the
Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount which Parent
informs the Escrow Agent in writing is necessary, in the reasonable judgment
of Parent, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers
Certificate delivered prior to the termination of the Escrow Period (such
claims, the " _Unsatisfied Claims_ ") and the Escrow Agent shall retain
possession of such amount. Promptly following the termination of the Escrow
Period, the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Escrow Fund, less any amount
required to satisfy any Unsatisfied Claims. Promptly following resolution of
all Unsatisfied Claims, Parent and the Stockholders Representative will
instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute the remainder of the Escrow Fund (if
any) to the Escrow Participants, based on each Escrow Participants Pro Rata
Portion.

 

(c) _Claims for Indemnification by Indemnified Parties_.

 

(i) In order to seek indemnification under this Section 9, an Indemnified
Party shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the Stockholders
Representative prior

 



57.   to the expiration of the Escrow Period and promptly after the Indemnified
Party acquires actual knowledge of the basis for a claim for indemnification
hereunder (provided that the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to
provide an Officers Certificate promptly shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure). With respect to each
Officers Certificate, upon compliance with the provisions of Sections 9.5(d)
and 9.5(e), a portion of the Escrow Fund with value equal to the amount of
Losses claimed in such Officers Certificate shall be withheld by the Escrow
Agent, and following compliance with Sections 9.5(d) and (e), any amounts
agreed upon by an Indemnified Party and the Stockholders Representative
pursuant to Sections 9.5(d) and 9.5(e) shall be delivered to Parent.
The amount withheld by the Escrow Agent and/or delivered to Parent pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall be deemed to reduce each applicable
Indemnifying Partys interest in the Escrow Fund on a _pro rata basis_ in
accordance with his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund, with all
such reductions to be calculated and deemed made immediately prior to any time
at which amounts are to be distributed from the Escrow Fund pursuant to
Section 9.5(c).

 

(d) _Objections to Claims against the Escrow Fund; Resolution of Conflicts_.
If the Stockholders Representative does not object to Parent in writing
within the 30-day period after delivery by any Indemnified Party of any
Officers Certificate, such failure to so object shall constitute an
irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholders Representative
and Indemnifying Parties that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate. In
case the Stockholders Representative shall object in writing to Parent to any
claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate to recover Losses within
the 30-day period after delivery of such Officers Certificate, the
Stockholders Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Stockholders Representative and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth any agreement reached by Parent and the Stockholders
Representative and with respect to such claim shall be prepared and signed by
Parent and the Stockholders Representative, and the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to the amount set forth in such memorandum.

 

(e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a
third-party claim which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result
in a demand against the Escrow Fund for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 9, such Indemnified Party shall notify the Stockholders
Representative of such claim, and the Stockholders Representative shall be
entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, at its expense, to participate
in (upon consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), but not
to determine or conduct, the defense of such claim. If there is a third-party
claim that, if adversely determined could give rise to a right of recovery for
Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or accrued by the Indemnified
Parties in defense of such third-party claim, regardless of the outcome of
such claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder. Parent shall have the right in
its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim;
provided, however, that except with the consent of the Stockholders
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event
that the Stockholders Representative has consented to any such settlement,
the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Section 9 to the amount of any claim by Parent against the
Escrow Fund with respect to such settlement. 

 



58.  9.6. Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereto agree that the provisions of
this Section 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for breaches of this
Agreement, other than any rights, claims or causes of action arising out of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation by a party and except that the parties
hereto may seek specific performance of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

9.7. Stockholders Representative.

 

(a) Each of the Indemnifying Parties (by execution of a Letter of Transmittal,
and by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and/or the surrender of
vested Target Stock Options in exchange for Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement, as applicable), hereby appoints Brian Robbins as its agent and
attorney-in-fact (the " _Stockholders  Representative_") for and on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties to give and receive notices and communications
(including to Parent), to authorize payment to Parent from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such payments, to consent to
or object to calculations of the Contingent Consideration, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders
of courts with respect to such matters, and to take all other actions that
are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by
the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior
written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the Stockholders
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a majority interest of the
Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholders Representative may be filled
by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholders Representative. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholders Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholders Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Indemnifying Parties on whose
behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall indemnify
the Stockholders Representative and hold the Stockholders Representative
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Stockholders Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable
fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholders
Representative (" _Stockholders  Representative Expense_"). Following the
Survival Date and the resolution of all pending claims made by the
Indemnified Parties for Losses, and from time to time thereafter, the
Stockholders Representative shall have the right to recover the Stockholders
Representative Expenses from any remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, prior
to any distribution to the Indemnifying Parties, or if the remaining portion
of the Escrow Fund is insufficient, from any Contingent Amount that may be
payable, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to Parent a
certificate setting forth the Stockholders Representative Expenses actually
incurred. Upon receipt of such certificate, Parent shall pay

 



59.   such Stockholders Representative Expenses to the Stockholders
Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders
Representatives right to recover Stockholders Representative Expenses shall
not prejudice Parents right to recover the full amount of indemnifiable
Losses that Parent is entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund or otherwise.

 

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders
Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or
waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.11 and Section 10.13 hereof,
shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties; and Parent may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Indemnifying Parties. Parent is hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative.

9.8. Ratification of this Agreement and the Indemnification Provisions. Each
Escrow Participant, by execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal
hereby agrees that he, she or it will be bound by the terms of this Agreement
applicable to Escrow Participants, as applicable, and will indemnify and hold
harmless the Indemnified Parties as set forth in Section 9 hereof. Each Escrow
Participant agrees, by execution of a Letter of Transmittal, that the
Indemnified Parties will be third party beneficiaries of the applicable
Letter of Transmittal, with the right to enforce the provisions thereof as if
they were a party to such Letter of Transmittal.

Agreement.

 



61.  10.5. Headings. The bold-faced and underlined headings contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed a part
of this Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

10.6. Counterparts and Exchanges by Electronic Transmission or Facsimile. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall
constitute an original and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute
one agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

10.7. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

(a) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

(b)  _Venue_. Except as otherwise set forth in the Escrow Agreement, any
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of
this Agreement may be brought or otherwise commenced in any state or federal
court located in the County of Los Angeles, California. Each party: (i)
expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of each
state and federal court located in the County of Los Angeles, California (and
each appellate court located in the State of California) in connection with
any such legal proceeding; (ii) agrees that each state and federal court
located in the County of Los Angeles, California shall be deemed to be a
convenient forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise), in any such Proceeding commenced in any state or
federal court located in the County of Los Angeles, California, any claim that
such party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of such Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject
matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court.

 

(c) _Indemnification Claims_. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 (and, at the option of any Indemnified
Party, any other claim for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim
based upon intentional misrepresentation, fraud or willful breach, relating to
this Agreement or the Merger after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved
exclusively in accordance with Section 9.5 (it being understood that, for the
avoidance of doubt and without limiting any portion of Section 10.7(b): (i) at
the option of any Indemnified Party, any claim based upon intentional
misrepresentation, fraud or willful breach may be brought and resolved in
accordance with Section 10.7(b) rather than in accordance with Section 9.5;
and (ii) nothing in this Section 10.7(c) shall prevent Parent from seeking
preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction).

10.8. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon: Target
and its successors and assigns (if any); Merger Sub and its respective
successors and assigns (if any); and Parent and its successors and assigns (if
any). This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of: Target; Merger Sub;
Parent; the other Indemnified Parties; and the respective successors and
assigns (if any) of the foregoing. Parent may freely assign any or all of its
rights under this Agreement (including its indemnification rights
under Section 9), in whole or in part, to any

 



62.   other Person without obtaining the consent or approval of any other party
hereto or of any other Person; _provided_ , that no such assignment shall
relieve Parent of any of its obligations hereunder. Target shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, assign or delegate any or all of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any other
Person, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such prior written
consent shall be void and of no force or effect.

10.9. Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. The rights and remedies of
the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The parties to
this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
any party to this Agreement of any covenant, obligation or other provision
set forth in this Agreement, for the benefit of any other party to this
Agreement: (a) such other party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it) to: (i) a decree or order of
specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant, obligation or other provision; and (ii) an injunction
restraining such breach or threatened breach; and (b) such other party shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action or
Proceeding.

10.10. Waiver.

(a) No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege
or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right,
privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of
any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

 

(b) No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have
any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. It is
understood that any waiver executed by the Stockholders Representative shall
be deemed to be delivered on behalf of each Escrow Participant and shall be
binding on such Person. 

10.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives any and all right to trial by jury in any Proceeding arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.12. Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered: (a) prior to the Closing Date, by all parties hereto; and (b) after
the Closing Date, by Parent and the Stockholders Representative (acting
exclusively for and on behalf of all of the Escrow Participants).

10.13. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any applicable jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or 

 



63.   enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity
or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or
in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

10.14. Parties in Interest. Except for the provisions of Section 9, none of
the provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies
to any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns (if any).

10.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall remain in effect
in accordance with its terms until the earlier of: (a) the Effective Time;
or (b) the date on which such Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

10.16. Construction.

(a) _Gender; Etc_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context
requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders.

(b) _Ambiguities_. The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to
the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party
shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Including_. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

(d) _References_. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections", "Exhibits" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement.
