withheld by the Escrow Agent, and following compliance with Sections 9.5(d) and (e), any amounts agreed upon by an Indemnified Party and the Stockholders&#146; Representative pursuant to Sections 9.5(d) and 9.5(e) shall be delivered to Parent. The

Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, at its expense, to participate in (upon consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such claim. If there is a
third-party claim that, if adversely determined could give rise to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or accrued by the Indemnified Parties in defense of such third-party claim, regardless of the outcome of such
claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; provided, however, that except with the consent of the Stockholders&#146; Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholders&#146; Representative has
consented to any such settlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this Section&nbsp;9 to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund with respect to such settlement.
