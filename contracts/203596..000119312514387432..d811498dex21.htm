vii _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 29,
2014, is made and entered into by and between Wesbanco, Inc., a West Virginia
corporation ("Buyer"), Wesbanco Bank, Inc., a West Virginia banking
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Buyer Sub"), ESB
Financial Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation and savings and loan
holding company ("Seller"), and ESB Bank, a Pennsylvania state-chartered stock
savings bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller ("Seller Sub"). Buyer and
Seller are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Constituent
Corporations."

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and Buyer Sub
have each determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
corporations and shareholders for Buyer to acquire Seller pursuant to a merger
of Seller with and into Buyer (the "Merger") and, immediately after the
Merger, a merger of Seller Sub with and into Buyer Sub (the "Bank Merger"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer and Buyer Sub
have each approved this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Seller will cease to have a separate corporate existence and the
shareholders of Seller will receive from Buyer in exchange for each share of
common stock, $0.01 par value, of Seller (individually "Seller Share" and
collectively "Seller Shares"), (a) $1.76 in cash, and (b) 0.502 of a share of
common stock, $2.0833 par value per share, of Buyer (individually, a "Buyer
Share" and collectively, the "Buyer Shares"), as may be adjusted as provided
herein, all as determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into this
Agreement, the directors and executive officers of Seller listed on _Exhibit
A_ hereto (the "Voting Agreement Shareholders") have each entered into a
Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Buyer (each a
"Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which each Voting Agreement Shareholder has
agreed, among other things, to vote such Voting Agreement Shareholders Seller
Shares in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Voting Agreement; and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and
the Bank Merger contemplated by this Agreement each qualify as a
"reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement is
intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; and

 

WHEREAS, Seller has previously provided to Buyer a schedule disclosing
additional information about Seller (the "Seller Disclosure Schedule"), and
Buyer has previously provided to Seller a schedule disclosing additional
information about Buyer (the "Buyer Disclosure Schedule"); and

 



1 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger and also to
prescribe certain conditions to the Merger and the Bank Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter
set forth, the parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows:

11.01(d)(iv), each Seller Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Seller Shares held directly or indirectly by
Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below)
(except for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in
Section 2.01(b) hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any

---|---|--- 



     | (b) | At the Effective Time, all Seller Shares that are owned
directly or indirectly by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than Seller Shares (x) held directly or indirectly in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity for the benefit of third parties (any such
shares, and shares of Buyer Common Stock which are similarly held, whether
held directly or indirectly by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, being
referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") or (y) held by Buyer or Seller
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, in respect of
a debt previously contracted (any such Seller Shares, and Buyer Shares which
are similarly held, being referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Buyer Shares, cash or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. At the Effective Time,
all Buyer Shares that are owned by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become treasury stock of Buyer
without any consideration therefor. 
---|---|---

     | (a) | Seller shall take all requisite action so that, at the
Effective Time, each option to acquire Seller Shares (each, a "Seller Stock
Option") granted under Sellers stock compensation and stock based incentive
plans (together with Sellers Amended and Restated Excess Benefit Plan, the
"Seller Stock Option and Benefit Plans") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer
Sub, Seller, Seller Sub, the holder of such Seller Stock Option or any other
person or entity, cancelled and converted into the right to receive
from Seller or from Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, at or immediately
following the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (x) the aggregate number of Seller Shares subject to such
Seller Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of $17.65 over the

(including obtaining any Seller or Seller Sub employee consents) that may be
necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 2.02. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.03. | _Exchange and Payment Procedures_ 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | _Exchange Agent_. Buyer shall designate Computershare
Investor Services, LLC or such other entity as shall reasonably be selected by
Buyer to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of conducting the
exchange and payment procedures as described in this Section 2.03. Seller
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably requested by
Buyer to be provided to the Exchange Agent in order for it to perform
as specified herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Deposit with Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. At least one business day prior
to the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide to the Exchange Agent the
aggregate number of Buyer Shares and an amount in cash representing the
aggregate cash component of the Merger Consideration, together with aggregate
cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(f)
hereto, all of which shall be held by the Exchange Agent in trust for the
holders of Seller Shares (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the Buyer Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except
that it shall receive and hold for the benefit of the recipients of the Buyer
Shares until distributed thereto pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
any dividends or other distributions paid or 

---|---|--- 
 



5 of the persons entitled thereto. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than as set forth in this paragraph. The Exchange Agent shall
invest cash in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Buyer, on a daily basis;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all such investments shall be in (1) obligations
of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, (2) commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or (3) certificates of
deposit of commercial banks (not including any Subsidiary (as defined in
Section 3.01(c)) or affiliate of Buyer) with capital exceeding $1.0 billion.
All interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Buyer. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

_Surrender of Seller Certificates_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in no event more than five business days
thereafter, Buyer shall send or cause to be sent to each former holder of
record of Seller Shares transmittal materials (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
theretofore representing the Seller Shares shall pass only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). Each holder of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which prior to the Effective Time
represented Seller Shares ("Seller Certificate"), who surrenders such Seller
Certificate to the Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (a) the Merger Consideration for each
Seller Share represented by the Seller Certificate surrendered, (b) any cash
in lieu of fractional shares into which the Seller Shares represented by the
Seller Certificate have been converted, (c) any other dividend or distribution
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
Buyer Shares issuable in the Merger, and (d) subject to compliance with
Section 7.08, any dividend or distribution with respect to Seller Shares with
a record date prior to the Effective Time, in each case without interest.
The Exchange Agent shall accept such Seller Certificate upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices and shall as promptly as practicable issue the certificates
representing Buyer Shares and cash in accordance with this Agreement. Each
Seller Certificate that is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein
provided, be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender (a) the Merger Consideration, (b) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the Seller Shares represented by
the Seller Certificate have been converted, (c) any other dividend or
distribution with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to Buyer Shares issuable in the Merger, and (d) subject to compliance
with Section 7.08, any dividend or distribution with respect to Seller Shares
with a record date prior to the Effective Time, in each case without 

---|---|--- 
 



6 date after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Shares shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Seller Certificate until the holder thereof
shall surrender such Seller Certificate in accordance with this Section
2.03(c). After the surrender of a Seller Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.03(c), the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to Buyer Shares represented by
such Seller Certificates. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of Seller of a Seller Certificate representing Seller
Shares and, if any such Seller Certificate is presented to Seller for
transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration
for each Seller Share represented by such Seller Certificate provided in
Article Two. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If there shall be
delivered to the Exchange Agent by any person who is unable to produce any
Seller Certificate for Seller Shares for surrender to the Exchange Agent
in accordance with this Section 2.03: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Seller Certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken, or
destroyed; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | such security or indemnity as reasonably may be requested
by the Surviving Corporation to save it harmless (which may include the
requirement to obtain a third party bond or surety); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | evidence, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation, that such person was the owner of the Seller Shares theretofore
represented by each such Seller Certificate claimed by him to be lost,
wrongfully taken or destroyed and that he is the person who would be entitled
to present such Seller Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 

then the Exchange Agent, in the absence of actual notice to it that any Seller
Shares theretofore represented by any such Seller Certificate have been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such person (a) the Merger
Consideration for each Seller Share represented by the lost, stolen or
destroyed Seller Certificate, (b) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
into which the Seller Shares represented by the Seller Certificate have been
converted, (c) any other dividend or distribution with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Buyer Shares issuable in the
Merger, and (d) subject to compliance with Section 7.08, any dividend or
distribution with respect to Seller Shares with a record date prior to the
Effective Time, in each case without interest, that such person would have
been entitled to receive upon surrender of each such lost, wrongfully taken
or destroyed Seller Certificate.

 



7 cash and Buyer Shares issued upon conversion of Seller Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Seller Shares; subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by Seller (but only in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement) on such Seller Shares prior to the Effective Time and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time, subject to compliance with Section 7.08. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | _No Fractional Buyer Shares_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | No certificates or scrip representing fractional Buyer
Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Seller Certificates
evidencing Seller Shares, and such fractional Buyer Share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the
Surviving Corporation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Each holder of Seller Shares who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fractional Buyer Share shall instead receive from the
Exchange Agent an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional Buyer Share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) interest to which such
holder (after taking into account all Seller Shares held at the Effective Time
by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (b) the Average Closing Price
(as defined in Section 11.01(d)(iv)). 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to the Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.03(b)
which remains undistributed to the shareholders of Seller for 12 months after
the Effective Time may be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon Buyers
demand, and any shareholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with
this Article Two shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Buyer
Share interest and any dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer Shares
issuable in the Merger, in each case without interest. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) | _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Seller, the Exchange Agent
or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Seller
Shares for any payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional Buyer Share interest or any dividends or distributions with
respect to Buyer Shares issuable in the Merger delivered to a public official
as and if required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. 
---|---|--- 
 



8 be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Seller Certificates such
amounts as Buyer or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other
provision of domestic or foreign (whether national, Federal, state,
provincial, local or otherwise) tax law. To the extent that amounts are
properly withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Buyer
or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Seller Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (j) | _Waiver_. The Surviving Corporation may from time to time,
in the case of one or more persons, waive one or more of the rights provided
to it in this Article Two to withhold certain payments, deliveries
and distributions; and no such waiver shall constitute a waiver of its rights
thereafter to withhold any such payment, delivery or distribution in the case
of any person. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 2.04. | _No Dissenters  Rights_ 
---|---|--- 

Anything contained in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, no outstanding Seller Shares or other shares of Sellers
capital stock shall have any dissenters rights of appraisal under the PBCL.

 



     | 2.05. | _Anti-Dilution Provisions_ 
---|---|--- 

In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding Buyer Shares are increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities (or
Buyer establishes a record date for effecting any such change to the
outstanding Buyer Shares) as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar changes in Buyers capitalization, excluding an acquisition by Buyer
involving an exchange of Buyer Shares not resulting in a recapitalization of
Buyer, appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to permit any action
which may be proscribed by this Agreement.



     | 2.06. | _Conversion of Seller Sub Capital Stock_ 
---|---|--- 

Immediately after the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share, and
each share held in the treasury, of capital stock of Seller Sub shall, by
virtue of the Bank Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer
Sub, Seller, Seller Sub or the holder thereof, be canceled without any
conversion or issuance of any shares of capital stock of Buyer or Buyer Sub
with respect thereto. No shares of Buyer or Buyer Sub shall be issued or
exchanged and no consideration shall be given for shares of Seller Sub, and
each then-issued and outstanding share, and each share then held in the
treasury, of capital stock of Buyer Sub shall, by virtue of the

 



9  Bank Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer Sub, Seller,
Seller Sub or the holder thereof, continue as one share of capital stock of
the Surviving Bank Corporation having the same designations, preferences,
limitations, and rights as such share of capital stock of Buyer Sub
immediately prior to the Bank Merger.

10 property and to carry on its business as presently conducted, and is qualified

of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on Seller.
Seller has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of the governing
instruments of Seller Sub, in each case as amended to the date of this
Agreement.

laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to be so organized,
existing, qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Seller. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

As used in this Agreement, (A) any reference to any event, change or effect
being "material" with respect to any entity means an event, change or effect
which is material in relation to the financial condition, properties, business
or results of operations of such entity and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
and (B) the terms "material adverse effect" or "material adverse change"
means, with respect to an entity, a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, properties, assets, liabilities, businesses or results of
operations of such entity and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the
ability of such entity to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the Merger or the Bank Merger and the other material transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than, in any case, any state of
facts, change, development, event, effect, condition or occurrence (i)
resulting from changes in the United States economy (including changes in
interest rates) or the United States securities markets in general; (ii)
resulting from changes in laws or regulations affecting banks or savings

Governmental Authorities; (iii) resulting from any litigation or loss of
current or prospective customers, employees or revenues arising from the
execution of this Agreement; (iv) resulting from any transaction costs of the
Merger generally; (v) resulting from payments made in the nature of severance

from changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political
conditions (including events of war or acts of terrorism); or (viii)
resulting from public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or
actions that are expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with
the prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that in no event
shall a decrease in the trading price of Seller Shares or Buyer Shares, absent
any other event, change or effect which has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect, or litigation relating thereto,
be considered a material adverse effect or material adverse change; and
_provided, further_ , that any state of facts, change, development, event,
effect, condition or occurrence referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (vi) or
(vii) immediately above shall be taken into account in determining whether a
material adverse effect or material adverse change has occurred to the extent
that such state of facts, change, development, event, effect, condition or
occurrence has a disproportionate effect on Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be, compared to other similarly situated community banking organizations
operating in the geographic regions in which the Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be, conduct their business. Any reference to "knowledge" or "actual
knowledge" of a party means the actual knowledge of the executive officers and

would not have a material adverse effect upon Seller. All such filings, at
the time of filing, complied in all material respects as to form and included
all exhibits required to be filed under the applicable rules of the SEC
applicable to such Seller SEC Documents. None of such documents, as
subsequently supplemented or amended prior to the date hereof, when filed,

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Seller. Seller (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure

information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves

officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Since December 31, 2010, (i) through the date hereof,

or claim that Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty

     | (h) |

     | (j) | _Loan Documentation_. The documentation ("Loan
Documentation") governing or relating to the material loan and credit-related
assets ("Loan Assets") included in the loan portfolio of the Seller
Subsidiaries is legally sufficient for the purposes intended thereby and

insufficiencies as would not have a material adverse effect on Seller. Except
as set forth in Section 3.01(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no debtor
under any of the Loan Documentation has asserted as of the date hereof any
claim or defense with respect to the subject matter thereof, which claim or
defense, if determined adversely to Seller, would have a material adverse
effect on Seller. All loans and extensions of credit that have been made by
the Seller Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with applicable
regulatory limitations and procedures.

of creditors rights generally, and by general equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law). Seller has previously made available to Buyer complete and correct
copies of its and the Seller Subsidiaries lending policies. The deposit and
loan agreements of Seller and each Seller Subsidiary comply in all material
respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The allowance for

regulatory requirements applicable to Seller or Seller Sub.

collectability or present other unfavorable features.

     | (ii) | Except in a manner that would not have a material adverse
effect on Seller, each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in accordance with its terms and with applicable law, including,
but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (the "Age Discrimination in
Employment Act"), or any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all
filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other
applicable law have been timely made. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which
is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (a "Seller Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter (including a determination that the related trust under such
Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the
Code) from the IRS, or is in the form of a prototype or volume submitter plan
that is the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS upon which
Seller is entitled to rely, and Seller is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter or
opinion letter. There is no material pending or, to the actual knowledge of
Seller, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to the Compensation
and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits thereunder. Neither
Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to
take any action, with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that would
reasonably be expected to subject Seller or any Seller Subsidiary to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA,
assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of
any such transaction expired as of the date hereof.

     | (iii) |

No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") which have been  

---|---|--- 
 



25 ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Seller or any subsidiary of
Seller with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity
(a "Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan") which is considered one employer with
Seller under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the
Code (a "Seller ERISA Affiliate"). During the six years prior to the Effective
Time, none of Seller, any Seller Subsidiary nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate
has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a multiemployer plan
under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (as defined in ERISA Sections 3(37)(A)
and 4001(a)(3)). No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived, has been required to be filed for any Compensation and Benefit Plan or
by any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending on the
date hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate
Plan and, to Sellers actual knowledge, no condition exists that presents a
material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending
investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the Department of Labor
("DOL"), the IRS or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any
Compensation and Benefit Plan and, to Sellers actual knowledge, no such
investigation or action is threatened or anticipated. Under each
Seller Pension Plan and Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the
most recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this Agreement,
the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of
the actuarial assumptions contained in such actuarial valuation of such Seller
Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate
Plan and since such date there has been neither an adverse change in the
financial condition of such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan
nor any amendment or other change to such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA
Affiliate Plan that would increase the amount of benefits thereunder which
reasonably could be expected to change such result and that, individually or
in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on Seller.

     | (iv) |

All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Compensation and
Benefit Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan or  

---|---|--- 
 



26 bargaining agreement to which Seller or any Seller Subsidiary is a party have
been timely made or have been reflected on the Seller Financial Statements.
Neither any Seller Pension Plan nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and all required payments to
the PBGC with respect to each Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate
Plan have been made on or before their due dates. None of Seller, any Seller
Subsidiary nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate (x) has provided, or would
reasonably be expected to be required to provide, security to any Seller
Pension Plan or to any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any
action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in the
imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect
on Seller.  
---|--- 



     | (v) | Except as disclosed in Section 3.01(t)(v) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has any
obligations to provide retiree health benefits, life insurance or other
retiree death benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than
benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or those derived from a Seller
Pension Plan. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries do not maintain any
foreign Compensation and Benefit Plans. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if

copies of the existing: (A) Compensation and Benefit Plan documents

most recent actuarial report and financial statement; (D) most recent summary
plan description; (E) forms filed with the PBGC within the past year (other
than for premium payments); (F) most recent determination letter issued by
the IRS; and (G) any Form 5310, Form 5310A, Form 5300 or Form 5330 filed
within the past year with the IRS.

     | (viii) |

Except as disclosed on Section 3.01(t)(viii) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result
of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time),
reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any Seller Employee, Seller Consultant
or Seller Director to any payment (including severance pay or similar
compensation) or any increase in compensation, (B) result in the

27 Compensation and Benefit Plan, or (C) result in any material increase in
benefits payable under any Compensation and Benefit Plan.  
---|--- 



     | (ix) | Except as disclosed on Section 3.01(t)(ix) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary maintains any
compensation plans, programs or arrangements, the payments under which would
not reasonably be expected to be deductible as a result of the limitations
under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | (x) | As a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of
any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time),
except as disclosed on Section 3.01(t)(x) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
none of Seller, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, will be obligated to make a payment that would be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code) of Seller
on a consolidated basis, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable
compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the
future. 
---|---|---

3.01(u) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or except with respect to

to comply with all applicable privacy policies, the Fair Credit Reporting Act
of 1970, as amended (the "Fair Credit Reporting Act"), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley

     | (c) | _Capitalization of Buyer_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

As of September 30, 2014, the authorized capital stock of Buyer consisted of
50,000,000 common shares, $2.0833 par value per share, of which 29,283,675
common shares were issued and outstanding and 83,836 common shares were held
in treasury by Buyer, and 1,000,000 preferred shares, no par value per share,
of which no shares were outstanding. The outstanding Buyer Shares have been
duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and
were not issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any person. As of
September 30, 2014, 276,726 Buyer  

---|---|--- 
 



36 outstanding stock options granted under Buyers stock option plans (the "Buyer
Stock Option Plans") and 442,428 Buyer Shares were available for future
grants of stock options under the Buyer Stock Option Plans. As of the date of
this Agreement, except for the Buyer Shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement and as disclosed in Section 4.01(c) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer has no other commitment or obligation to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any Buyer Shares. There are no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Buyer, and no securities or
other instruments or obligations of Buyer the value of which is in any way
based upon or derived from any capital or voting stock of Buyer, having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of Buyer may vote. Buyer,
Inc. Capital Trust II, Buyer, Inc. Capital Statutory Trust III, Buyer, Inc.
Capital Trust IV, Buyer, Inc. Capital Trust V and Buyer, Inc. Capital Trust VI
and Oak Hill Capital Trusts II, III and IV are all wholly-owned trust
subsidiaries of Buyer formed for the purpose of issuing "trust preferred
securities." The proceeds from the sale of the securities and the issuance of
common stock by the trusts were invested in Junior Subordinated Deferrable
Interest Debentures (the "Junior Subordinated Debt") issued by Buyer and the
formerly acquired Oak Hill Bank, which are the sole assets of the trusts. The
Junior Subordinated Debt (i) is not convertible into Buyer Shares, (ii)
carries no voting rights with respect to any Buyer Shares, and (iii) contains
no dividend limitation provisions upon Buyer Shares except in the event of
default in the payments due therein. Except as set forth above, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no material contracts, agreements,
commitments or arrangements of any kind to which Buyer is a party or by which
Buyer is bound (collectively, "Buyer Contracts") obligating Buyer to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or securities
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, Buyer. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding material contractual obligations of Buyer
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, Buyer. 
---|--- 



     | (ii) | The Buyer Shares to be issued in exchange for Seller Shares
in the Merger, when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, will
not be subject to any preemptive or other statutory right of Buyer
stockholders and will be issued in compliance with applicable United States
Federal and state securities laws. 
---|---|---

due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller and Seller Sub,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and Buyer Sub,
enforceable against Buyer and Buyer Sub in accordance with its terms, except
as the same may be limited by laws related to safety and soundness of insured
depository institutions as set forth in 12 U.S.C. §1818(b), the appointment
of a conservator, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally, by general equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law) and by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Each of
Buyer and Buyer Sub has the right, power, authority and capacity to execute
and deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Required Buyer Vote,
the expiration of applicable regulatory waiting periods, and required filings
under Federal and state securities laws, to perform its obligations under
this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Buyer has the corporate power and
authority to take the actions contemplated by Section 6.07 of this Agreement.

Schedule and subject to the receipt of the required approvals of Regulatory
Authorities and Governmental Authorities, the expiration of applicable
regulatory waiting periods, the approval of the issuance of the Buyer Shares
under this Agreement in connection with the Merger by the Required Buyer Vote,
the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Seller Vote and required
filings under Federal and state securities laws, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Buyer and Buyer Sub do not and will not (i)
conflict with, or result in a violation of, or result in the breach of or a
default (or which with notice or lapse of time would result in a default)
under, any provision of: (A) any Federal, state or local law, regulation,
ordinance, order, rule or administrative ruling of any Governmental Authority
applicable to Buyer or Buyer Sub or any of its or their properties; (B) the
certificates of incorporation or bylaws of Buyer or Buyer Sub; (C) any
material agreement, indenture or instrument to which Buyer or Buyer Sub is a
party or by which it or their properties or assets may be bound; or (D) any
order, judgment, writ, injunction or decree of any court, arbitration panel
or any Governmental Authority applicable to Buyer or Buyer Sub; (ii) result in
the creation or acceleration of any security interest, mortgage, option,
claim, lien, charge or encumbrance upon or interest in any property of Buyer
or Buyer Subsidiaries, other than such security interests, mortgages,
options, claims, liens, charges or encumbrances that, individually or in the

38 or (iii) violate the terms or conditions of, or result in the cancellation,
modification, revocation or suspension of, any material license, approval,
certificate, permit or authorization held by Buyer or any of the Buyer
Subsidiaries, other than such violations, cancellations, modifications,
revocations or suspensions that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. 
---|--- 



     | (f) | _SEC Filings; Sarbanes Oxley_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have filed all reports,
registration statements, proxy statements and information statements required
to be filed by Buyer or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries subsequent to December
31, 2010 under the Securities Act or under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d)
of the Exchange Act with the SEC (together with all information incorporated
therein by reference, the "Buyer SEC Documents"), except for any reports,
registration statements, proxy statements or information statements the
failure to file which would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer. All
such filings, at the time of filing, complied in all material respects as to
form and included all exhibits required to be filed under the applicable
rules of the SEC. None of such documents, when filed, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

The records, systems, controls, data and information of Buyer and the Buyer
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Buyer. Buyer (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information relating to Buyer, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of Buyer by others within those entities, and (y)
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,
to Buyers outside auditors and the audit committee of Buyers Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect  

---|---|--- 
 



39 financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyers
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act). These disclosures were made in writing by management to
Buyers auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Seller. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that
Buyers outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. 
---|--- 



      | (iii) | Since December 31, 2010, (i) through the date hereof,
neither Buyer nor any of the Buyer Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had
or obtained actual knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Buyer or any of
the Buyer Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Buyer
or any of the Buyer Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Buyer or any of the
Buyer Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Buyer or any of the Buyer
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Buyer or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Buyer
or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Buyer.

in Section 4.01(l)) is, and has been throughout the periods covered thereby,
"independent" within the meaning of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. Ernst and Young
LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as an independent public accountant of
Buyer as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with Buyer on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

have actual knowledge of any reason why the approvals set forth in Section
7.07 will not be received. 
---|--- 



     | (l) | _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth
in the Buyer SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement (the "Buyer Filed SEC Documents") (including the financial
statements included therein) or in Section 4.01(l) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule and except as arising hereunder, Buyer and its subsidiaries
(individually "Buyer Subsidiary" or collectively "Buyer Subsidiaries") have
no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) at June 30, 2014, other than liabilities and

---|---|--- 
 



     | (m) | _Absence of Changes_. Except (i) as set forth in the Buyer

the actual knowledge of Buyer, no fact or condition exists which Buyer
believes will cause such a material adverse change in the future. 
---|---|--- 



     | (n) |

_Loan Documentation_. The Loan Documentation and Loan Assets included in the
loan portfolio of the Buyer Subsidiaries is legally sufficient for the
purposes intended thereby and creates enforceable rights of the

an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, except for such
insufficiencies as would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Except
as set forth in Section 4.01(n) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, no debtor
under any of the Loan Documentation has asserted as of the date hereof any
claim or defense with respect to the subject matter thereof, which claim or
defense, if determined adversely to Buyer, would have a material adverse
effect on Buyer. All loans and extensions of credit that have been made by
the Buyer Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with applicable
regulatory limitations and procedures. 
---|--- 



     | (o) | _Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | To Buyers knowledge, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer, each Loan on Buyers or
Buyer Subs books and records, was made and has been serviced in accordance
with Buyers lending standards in the ordinary course of business; is
evidenced by appropriate and sufficient documentation; to the extent secured,
has been secured by valid liens and security interests which have been
perfected; and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance and other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally, and by general equitable principles (regardless
of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     | (iii) | Buyer shall reasonably promptly after the end of each

have filed all reports and maintained all records required to be filed or
maintained by them under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve, the
FDIC and the West Virginia Division of Banking, except for such reports and
records the failure to file or maintain would not have a material adverse
effect on Buyer. All such documents and reports complied in all material
respects with applicable requirements of law and rules and regulations in
effect at the time such documents and reports were filed and contained in all
material respects the information required to be stated therein, except for
such documents and records the failure to comply with such laws, rules and
regulations or contain such information would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Buyer. None of such documents or reports,
when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, other than such reports and documents which the
failure to file in such fashion would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyer. There is no material unresolved violation,
criticism or exception by any Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority
with respect to any report or letter relating to any examinations of Buyer or
any of the Buyer Subsidiaries.

Tax Returns, other than such Taxes that are adequately reserved as shown on
the Buyer Financial Statements or have arisen in the ordinary  

---|---|--- 
 



44 as set forth in Section 4.01(q) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither the
IRS nor any other taxing agency or authority, domestic or foreign, has
asserted, is now asserting or, to the actual knowledge of Buyer, is

claim for additional Taxes. There are no unexpired waivers by Buyer or
any Buyer Subsidiary of any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes. The
accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the Buyer Financial Statements
are adequate in all material respects for the periods covered. Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiaries have withheld or collected and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities or are properly holding for such payment
all Taxes required by law to be withheld or collected, except for such
failures to withhold or collect as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyer. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets
of Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary, other than liens for current Taxes not yet
due and payable and liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has agreed to make, or is required to make, any
adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code. Except as set forth in the Buyer
SEC Documents or in Section 4.01(q) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither

     | (r) | _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in the Buyer Filed
SEC Documents or Section 4.01(r) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, there are
no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or investigations pending or, to the

Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary which, if adversely determined against Buyer or
any Buyer Subsidiary, could have a material adverse effect on Buyer; or (ii)
against or by Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary which, if adversely determined
against Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary, could prevent the consummation of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or declare the same
to be unlawful or cause the rescission thereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | (s) |

_Regulatory Matters._ Except as set forth in Section 4.01(s) of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, none of Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries and the respective
properties of Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries is a party to or 

---|---|--- 
 



45 of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or
similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any
Regulatory Authorities that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has been advised by any Regulatory Authority
that such Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is
considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order,
judgment, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter,
supervisory letter or similar submission that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Buyer. Buyer and Buyer Bank are, and at the time of the Merger will be, "well
capitalized" as such term is defined in Regulation Y. 
---|--- 



     | (t) | _Employee Benefit Plans_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Section 4.01(t)(i) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule contains
a complete and accurate list of all bonus, incentive, deferred compensation,
pension (including, without limitation, Buyer Pension Plans, as
defined below), retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock
ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
severance, welfare (including, without limitation, "welfare plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, fringe benefit plans, employment, change in
control, retention or severance agreements, consulting agreements or
arrangements and all similar practices, policies and arrangements maintained
or contributed to (currently or within the last two years) by (A) Buyer or
any Buyer Subsidiary and in which any employee or former employee (the "Buyer
Employees"), consultant or former consultant (the "Buyer Consultants"),
officer or former officer (the "Buyer Officers"), or director or former
director (the "Buyer Directors") of Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary participates
or to which any such Buyer Employees, Buyer Consultants, Buyer Officers or
Buyer Directors are parties or (B) any Buyer ERISA Affiliate (as defined
below) (collectively, the "Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has any commitment to create any additional
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan, except to the extent required by law and as
otherwise contemplated by Sections 6.02 and 7.02 of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

Except in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Buyer, each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan has
been operated and administered in accordance with its terms and with
applicable law, including, but not limited 

---|---|--- 
 



46 the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices required by
ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely made. Each
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Buyer Pension
Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter (including a determination that
the related trust under such Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan is exempt
from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the IRS and Buyer is not aware
of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the actual knowledge
of Buyer, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to the Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits
thereunder. Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section
4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of
the date hereof. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iii) |

No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC which have been
made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been or
is expected to be incurred by Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer with respect to
any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (a "Buyer ERISA Affiliate
Plan") which is considered one employer with Buyer under Section 4001(a)(14)
of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code (a "Buyer ERISA
Affiliate"). None of Buyer, any Buyer Subsidiary or any Buyer ERISA Affiliate
has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a multi-employer plan
under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (as defined in ERISA Sections 3(37)(A)
and 4001(a)(3)) at any time since September 26, 1980. No notice of a
"reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the
30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be

Buyer. During the same period, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of (i) the
occurrence of any breach in any material respect of any of Sellers or Seller
Subs covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event
that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in this Agreement impossible
or unlikely in any material respect or (iii) the occurrence of any event that
is reasonably likely, individually or taken with all other facts, events or
circumstances known to Seller, to result in a material adverse effect with
respect to Seller.

 



59 ---|---|--- 

(a) Seller shall not and shall cause Seller Sub and the respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents of Seller and Seller Sub
(collectively, the "Seller Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
below); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any person
(other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to Seller or
the Seller Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) release any person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which Seller is a party;
(iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) take any action to render
the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable to any person (other than
Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries) or group in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Seller
Representatives, whether or not such Seller Representative is so authorized
and whether or not such Seller Representative is purporting to act on behalf
of Seller or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
Seller. Seller and Seller Sub shall, and shall cause each of the Seller
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any persons with
respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean
any inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any transaction or
series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Seller or Seller Sub; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any third party
or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or other
disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, twenty percent (20%) or more of
the assets of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (C)
any issuance, sale or other disposition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) of securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the votes attached to
the outstanding securities of Seller or the Seller Sub; (D) any tender offer
or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party or
group beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity
securities of Seller or the Seller Sub; or (E) any transaction which is
similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or
any combination of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.03(a), Seller may take any of
the actions described in clause (ii) of Section 5.03(a) if, but only if, (i)
Seller has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this Section

 



60  5.03; (ii) Sellers Board of Directors (the "Seller Board") determines in
good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of its
outside legal counsel and Sellers Financial Advisor, that failure to take
such actions would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Pennsylvania
law; (iii) Seller has provided Buyer with at least two (2) business days prior
notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording
access to any information or data with respect to Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Seller receives
from such person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to
Seller than those contained in the confidentiality agreement between Seller
and Buyer. Seller shall promptly provide to Buyer any non-public information
regarding Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries provided to any other person
which was not previously provided to Buyer, such additional information to be
provided no later than the date of provision of such information to such other
party.

 

(c) Seller shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Buyer in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Seller or the Seller Representatives, in
each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice
shall indicate the name of the person initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, such notice shall include copies of such materials
(including e-mails or other electronic communications) unless (i) such
materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer
or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement, (ii) disclosure of
such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or (iii) disclosure
of such materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree). Seller shall keep Buyer informed, on a current basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such
proposal, offer or request).

(d) Neither the Seller Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
withhold, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), the
Seller Board Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.06(f)), or make any
statement, filing or release, in connection with the Seller Meeting (as
defined in Section 7.06(e)) or otherwise, inconsistent with the Seller Board
Recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification of the Seller Board Recommendation); (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;
or (iii) enter into (or cause Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries to enter
into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction or (B) requiring
Seller to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger, the Bank
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Seller or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such rules will in no
way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



61 (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.03(d), prior to the date of
the Seller Meeting (as defined in Section 7.06(e)), the Seller Board may
approve or recommend to the shareholders of Seller a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) and withdraw, qualify or modify the Seller Board Recommendation
in connection therewith (a "Seller Subsequent Determination") after the third
business day following Buyers receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from Seller advising Buyer that the Seller Board has decided that a
bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did
not result from a breach of this Section 5.03) constitutes a Superior Proposal
(it being understood that Seller shall be required to deliver a new Notice of
Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third
party or its affiliates that Seller proposes to accept) if, but only if, (i)
the Seller Board has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation
with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and Sellers
Financial Advisor, that failure to take such actions would violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Pennsylvania law, (ii) during the three (3)
business day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by
Buyer, Seller and the Seller Board shall have cooperated and negotiated in
good faith with Buyer and give due consideration to such adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
may be proposed by Buyer in making a determination whether Seller will proceed
with the Seller Board Recommendation without a Seller Subsequent
Determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer nor Seller
shall have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the end
of such three (3) business day period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by Buyer since
its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Seller Board has again in
good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 5.03(f)
and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
Seller Board Recommendation or the making of a Seller Subsequent Determination
by the Seller Board shall not change the approval of the Seller Board for
purposes of causing any Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement and
the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger and the Bank Merger.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on
terms that the Seller Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel
and Sellers Financial Advisor of nationally recognized reputation (i) would,
if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of
the issued and outstanding shares of Seller common stock or all,
or substantially all, of the assets of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that (A) involves
consideration to the holders of the Seller Shares that is more favorable, from
a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to Sellers
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the
nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory
approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed
transaction beyond or in addition to those specifically contemplated hereby,
and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining additional financing and
(B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to
Sellers shareholders than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal.

 



62 ---|---|--- 

Seller shall furnish to Buyer promptly after such documents are available:
(a) all reports, proxy statements or other communications by Seller to its
shareholders generally; and (b) all press releases relating to any
transactions.

Seller shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued
exemption of) this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Merger and the Bank
Merger from the requirements of any Takeover Law applicable to it and
comparable provisions in the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Seller or
Seller Sub, and (b) assist in any challenge by Buyer to the validity, or
applicability to the Merger or the Bank Merger, of any Takeover Law.



     | 5.06. | _No Control_ 
---|---|--- 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of Seller or the Seller
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Seller and Buyer shall exercise, consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries respective
operations.



     | 5.07. | _Exchange Listing_ 
---|---|--- 

Seller shall take all necessary actions, and Buyer shall provide reasonable
cooperation in connection with same, in order to effect the delisting of the
Seller Shares from the Nasdaq effective contemporaneously with the Effective
Time.

 



     | 5.08. | _Section 16 Votes_ 
---|---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall approve in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12,
1999) any disposition of equity securities of Seller (including derivative
securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each officer and director of Seller who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act.

 



     | 5.09. | [Reserved] 
---|---|--- 
 



63 ---|---|--- 

Seller shall take all such necessary action to suspend the acceptance of
dividends and other contributions of participants in the Sellers Dividend
Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP") effective promptly after the date of this Agreement
(taking into account any Seller dividends that have been declared but not yet
paid as of the date hereof). In addition, prior to the Effective Time, Seller
shall take such action as is necessary to terminate the DRIP and shall
distribute all Seller Shares and the value of all cash held in participants
plan accounts in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.



     | 5.11. | _ESOP and 401(k) Matters_ 
---|---|--- 

(a) _ESOP Matters_. Sellers ESOP shall be terminated by Seller in accordance
with its terms effective as of the Effective Time and Seller shall make all
other appropriate amendments thereto necessary to effectuate such ESOP
termination. Seller shall continue to make contributions to the ESOP in
accordance with applicable accruals and in the ordinary course of business as
disclosed in Section 3.01(t) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The accounts
of all participants and beneficiaries in the ESOP as of the Effective Time
shall become fully vested as of the Effective Time. Each Seller Share held in

Consideration received with respect to the unallocated Seller Shares held in
the ESOP shall first be used to repay the then outstanding balance of the
ESOP loan in its entirety, with the excess amount of the Merger Consideration
received with respect to the unallocated Seller Shares to be allocated
proportionately to all holders of ESOP accounts based on their account
balances as of the beginning of the plan year in which the ESOP is terminated.
As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall prepare and file or
cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination
letter with respect to the termination of the ESOP. Prior to the Effective
Time, Seller and, following the Effective Time, Buyer shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination letter as
promptly as practicable (including, but not limited to, adopting such
amendments to the ESOP as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its
issuance of a favorable determination letter). As soon as practicable
following the later of the Effective Time or the receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of the ESOP
upon its termination, the account balances in the ESOP shall be either
distributed to participants and beneficiaries or rolled over to an eligible
tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct. Buyer shall permit Continuing Employees
to rollover their account balances in the ESOP to the Buyers Employee Stock
Ownership and 401(k) Plan.

(b) _401(k) Plan Matters_. Seller and Seller Sub shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Sellers Retirement Savings Plan (the "401(k)

account as a participant or beneficiary may direct. Buyer agrees to permit

the Buyers Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan.

other than as employees at will under Pennsylvania law. From and after the
Effective Time, the Employees of Seller and Seller Sub who remain employees of

agreements and any applicable payment elections made thereunder.

     | (d) | As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall succeed Seller as
sponsor and administrator of the Compensation and Benefit Plans and shall take
such action as necessary to effectuate such changes. Subject to Sections
6.02(a) and 6.02(c), Buyer may terminate, merge or amend any Compensation and
Benefit Plan or may cease contributions to any Compensation and Benefit Plan
to the extent permitted by applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer

insurance contract or any laws, statutes or regulations requiring any
continuation of benefit coverage upon the happening of certain events, such as
the termination of employment or change in beneficiary or dependent status,

the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Buyer, the Retention
Employees eligible to receive retention awards from the Retention Pool (each,
a "Retention Bonus") and any criteria for payment of the Retention Bonus, and
shall determine the final allocation of payments from the Retention Pool. Any
Retention Bonus shall be intended to retain the services of the recipient
through, and shall be payable (if such recipient still remains employed by the

prescribed by applicable rules and regulations of the Nasdaq, and shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Shares to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer
will use its best efforts to maintain its listing on the Nasdaq.

 



     | 6.04. | _Notification_

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller in writing if Buyer becomes aware of any fact or condition that
(i) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of any of Buyers
or Buyer Subs representations and warranties or (ii) would (except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach in any
material respect of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or
discovery of such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition
require any change in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer shall promptly
deliver to Seller a supplement to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule specifying
such change ("Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule"); _provided, however_ , that
the disclosure of such change in the Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to constitute a cure of any breach of any representation or
warranty made pursuant to this Agreement unless consented to in writing by
Seller. During the same period, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of (i) the
occurrence of any breach in any material respect of any of Buyers or Buyer
Subs covenants contained in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event
that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in this Agreement impossible
or unlikely in any material respect or (iii) the occurrence of any event that
is reasonably likely, individually or taken with all other facts, events or
circumstances known to Buyer, to result in a material adverse effect with
respect to Buyer.



     | 6.05 _._  | _Takeover Laws_ 
---|---|--- 

Buyer shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued
exemption of) this Agreement, the Merger and the Bank Merger from the
requirements of any Takeover Law and from any provisions under its Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, as applicable, by action of the Board of
Directors of Buyer or otherwise, and (b) assist in any challenge by Seller to
the validity, or applicability to the Merger or the Bank Merger, of any
Takeover Law.



     | 6.06. | _Officers  and Directors Indemnification and Insurance_ 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

From and after the Effective Time, each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of Seller and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (each an "Indemnified Party") against any costs 

---|---|--- 
 



68 judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively,
"Costs") incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out
of the fact that such person is or was as director or officer of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by Seller pursuant to applicable law as effect on the date of
this Agreement, the Sellers Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws or the
governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Seller; and Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by such
Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to
the Sellers Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws or the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Seller; _provided_ , that the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law as effect on the
date of this Agreement or the Sellers Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) | For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Seller
( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend an amount in excess of $250,000
(the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good
faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an amount
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Seller, in consultation
with, but only upon the consent of Buyer, may obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under Sellers existing directors
and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described
in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained
for an amount that does not exceed the Premium Cap. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or

69 its properties and assets to any person or (iii) transfers, by means of a
distribution, sale, assignment or other transaction, all of the stock of the
Surviving Corporation or all or substantially all of its assets, to any
person, then, and in each such case, Buyer shall cause proper provision to be
made so that the successor and assign of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this Section and in such
event all references to the Surviving Corporation in this Section shall be
deemed a reference to such successor and assign. 
---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.06(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof;
provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of
Buyer under Section 6.06(a) unless and only to the extent that Buyer is
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | The provisions of this Section 6.06 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

---|---|---

or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | if (i) the Seller Board (A) modifies, qualifies, withholds
or withdraws the Seller Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it
being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect

---|---|--- 



     | (d) | By Seller, if its Board of Directors so determines, by

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | if prior to the Closing Date, any representation and
warranty of Buyer or Buyer Sub shall have become untrue such that the
condition set forth at Section 8.02(a) would not be satisfied and which breach
has not been cured within 30 calendar days following receipt by Buyer of
written notice of breach or is incapable of being cured during such time
period; 
---|---|--- 
 



82 any material respect with any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer or
Buyer Sub contained in this Agreement required to be complied with prior to
the date of such termination, which failure to comply shall not have been
cured within 30 calendar days following receipt by Buyer of written notice of
such failure to comply or is incapable of being cured during such time period; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | in connection with entering into a definitive agreement to

accordance with Section 5.03(f); or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | at any time during the five-day period commencing on the
Walkaway Determination Date (the "Seller Walkaway Right"), if: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (1) | the Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall be less
than the product of 0.85 and the Starting Price (as defined below); _and_ 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | (a) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing
Price by the Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the
"Buyer Ratio") shall be less than (b) the number obtained by dividing the
Index Price (as defined below) on the Walkaway Determination Date (as defined
below) by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined below) (the "Index
Ratio") and subtracting 0.15 from such quotient;  
---|---|--- 

subject to the following. If Seller elects to exercise its termination right
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written
notice to Buyer; provided that such notice of election to terminate may be
withdrawn by Seller at any time within the aforementioned five-day period.
During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Buyer
shall have the option of paying additional Merger Consideration by increasing
the Exchange Ratio to equal the number obtained by dividing $15.89 by the
greater of (i) the product of 0.85 and the Starting Price or (ii) the product
obtained by multiplying the Index Ratio by the Starting Price (the "Buyer Top-
up Notice"). If Buyer makes this election, within such five-day period, it
shall give prompt written notice to Seller of such election and the revised
Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 11.01(d)(iv) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified),
and any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be
deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio after giving effect to any adjustment
made pursuant to this Section 11.01(d)(iv). For purposes of this Section
11.01(d)(iv), the following terms shall have the following meanings:

"Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported sale price per
share of the Buyer Shares as reported on the Nasdaq (as reported in The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed upon
authoritative source) for each of the 10 consecutive trading days ending on
the Walkaway Determination Date.

 



83 "Walkaway Determination Date" means the later of (i) the first date on which
all necessary bank regulatory approvals or non-objections have been received
(disregarding any waiting period), which list of such approvals and non-
objections shall be mutually agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller within
30 days of the date of this Agreement or (ii) the date on which the Sellers
shareholders approve this Agreement.

"Index Price" on a given date means the closing value of the Nasdaq Bank
Index as reported on Bloomberg.com, or if not reported therein, in another
mutually agreed upon authoritative source.

 

"Per Share Consideration" shall mean the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the
Average Closing Price.

 

"Starting Price" shall mean the average of the last reported sale price per
share of Buyer Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq (as reported in The
Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed
upon authoritative source) for each of the 10 consecutive trading days ending
on the Starting Date.

 

"Starting Date" shall mean the last full trading day prior to the announcement
by press release of the Merger or, if such announcement occurs after the
close of trading on any trading day, such trading day.

If Buyer declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, non-acquisitive exchange of shares or
similar transaction between the Starting Date and the Walkaway Determination
Date (or establishes a record date in respect thereof), the prices for the
common stock of Buyer shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of
applying this Section 11.01(d)(iv).

 



84 ---|---|--- 



     | (a) | If this Agreement is validly terminated by either Seller or
Buyer pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement will forthwith become null and
void and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of
Seller, Seller Sub, Buyer or Buyer Sub, except (i) that the provisions of
Sections 7.01, 12.06, 12.07, 12.11 and this Article Eleven will continue to
apply following any such termination, (ii) that nothing contained herein shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for any liabilities or damages
arising out of its fraud or knowing breach of any provision of this Agreement
and (iii) as provided in paragraphs (b)-(f) below. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer a termination fee of
$11,354,000 (the "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated by (i)
Buyer pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(iii) or (ii) Seller pursuant to Section
11.01(d)(iii). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or
Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(b)(i) without the Required Seller Vote having
been obtained, or Section 11.01(b)(ii), and (i) an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to Seller shall have been publicly announced, disclosed or otherwise
communicated to the Seller Board prior to the date specified in Section
11.01(b)(i) or prior to the Seller Meeting, and (ii) within twelve (12)
months of such termination, Seller shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or Seller shall have consummated, an Acquisition
Transaction, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Termination
Fee.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
pursuant to Sections 11.01(c)(i) or (ii) and (A) an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to Seller shall have been publicly announced, disclosed or otherwise
communicated to the Seller Board prior to any breach by Seller of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement giving rise to such
termination by Buyer or during the cure period therefor provided in Sections
11.01(c)(i) or (ii) and (B) within twelve (12) months of such termination,
Seller shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
Seller shall have consummated, an Acquisition Transaction, then Seller shall
pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Termination Fee. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

Any payment of the Termination Fee required to be made pursuant to this
Section 11.02 shall be made not more than two (2) business days after the
date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment, unless
the Termination Fee is payable as a result of the termination of this
Agreement by Seller pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii), in which case, the
Termination Fee shall be payable concurrently with such termination. All
payments under this Section 11.02 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer. No payment of
the Termination Fee under this Section 11.02 shall limit in any respect any
rights or remedies available to Buyer relating to any breach or 

---|---|--- 
 



85 covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement resulting, directly or
indirectly, in the right to receive the Termination Fee under this Section
11.02. 
---|--- 



     | (f) | Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 11.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into
this Agreement. The Termination Fee amounts payable by Seller pursuant to this
Section 11.02 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the
sole monetary remedy of Buyer except in circumstances where no Termination Fee
is payable. Accordingly, if Seller fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 11.02 and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Seller for the amount set
forth in this Section 11.02, Seller shall pay to Buyer its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at a rate
per annum equal to three-month LIBOR (as reported in The Wall Street Journal
(Northeast edition), or if not reported therein, in another authoritative
source selected by the party to which the payment is due) plus 200 basis
points as in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
