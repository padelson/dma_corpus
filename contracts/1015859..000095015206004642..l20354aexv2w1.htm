that under applicable standards of professional conduct such counsel would
have a conflict representing such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties or

Confidentiality Agreement executed by Parent, provide any non-public
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries to any third party or
engage in any negotiations or substantive discussions with such Person
regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, in each case only if the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation

shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by the

was not solicited by the Company or any of its Affiliates or advisors, the
Board of Directors of the Company and the Partnership may terminate this
Agreement and cause the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to
any Company Superior Proposal, but only if the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with counsel, that failing to
take any such action would result in a breach of the directors duties and
only at a time that is after the fifth business day following the
Companys delivery to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the Board
of Directors of the Company is prepared to accept a Company Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company

action would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Companys
Board of Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement
and the Board of Directors shall not recommend a Company Superior Proposal to
the Common Shareholders or withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent

such action with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, specifying in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the Company Superior
Proposal, such notice to be delivered not less than five Business Days prior
to the time the action is taken, and, during this five Business Day
period, the Company and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such Company Takeover Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal. 

   

 (iii) The Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and within 24 hours in writing of the receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal or the request for any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary by any Person that informs the Board of Directors of the Company or such Subsidiary that it is considering making or has made a Company Takeover Proposal.

 (a) If prior to May 26, 2006, the purchaser of the Radisson Suite Beach Resort  Marco Island (the " _Marco Purchaser_ " and the hotel, the " _Marco Hotel_ ") pursuant to the Hotel Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2006, between the Marco Purchaser and Boykin Marco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Marco Agreement_ "), has not made the Additional Deposit (as defined in the Marco Agreement) with the escrow agent under the Marco Agreement, Parent shall have the right to (i) deliver a notice of termination to the Company (the " _Marco Termination Notice_ ") on or prior to June 8, 2006, or (ii) remain obligated under the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and, if the Effective Time occurs, retain any deposit made by the Marco Purchaser.

Following receipt from Parent of a Marco Termination Notice, the Company shall have the right, by written notice to Parent, to accept the Marco Termination Notice, in which case this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of such acceptance. So long as the Company has not accepted the Marco Termination Notice, the Company shall have until July 7, 2006 to enter into an agreement or other arrangement for the sale or other disposition of the Marco Hotel, and if the Company enters into such an agreement or arrangement within such time period, the parties will negotiate in good faith concerning any increase or decrease in the consideration payable by Parent pursuant to this Agreement based on the terms of such new agreement or arrangement. If, by the date that is the earlier of July 12, 2006 and five (5) days after the Company enters into such new agreement or arrangement, the parties are unable to agree on the increase or decrease in the consideration payable by Parent pursuant hereto, this Agreement shall terminate as of such earlier date.

 (b) During the Standstill Period (as defined below), without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries, Westmont USA Development Inc. or its Affiliates or Cadim, Inc. to, contact, discuss, negotiate with or enter into any agreement with, any Person (including, without limitation, any franchisor, lender, customer or vendor of the Company, its Affiliates or its hotel operators or any Affiliate of such parties) regarding any aspect of the transactions contemplated hereunder or the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except for discussions with any lender or ground lessor from whom a consent is required to be obtained as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby and except for discussions with any actual or potential equity partner, lender, other potential financing source or advisor of Parent.

If Parent breaches or violates the covenant in this Section 6.2(b), then notwithstanding a   ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(a), Parent shall not be
entitled under any circumstances to reimbursement of Expenses of any amount
pursuant to Section 6.3(a) or a Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.3(b). 

  

  

  

 6.3 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(d), 6.1(g) or 6.2(a) (but subject to the provisions of Section 6.2(b)), then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the sum of Parents Expenses (not to exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 6.1(d) or 6.1(g) and not to exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate with respect to a termination pursuant to Section 6.2(a)) for which Parent has not theretofore been reimbursed by the Company. " _Expenses_ " means all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of financing sources, counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing. Payment of Parents Expenses pursuant to this Section 6.3(a) shall be made not later than five Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment and a documented itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all Expenses of Parent (which itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time by Parent until the ninetieth day after Parent delivers such notice of demand for payment). 

   

 (b) In the event that (i) any Person makes a Company Takeover Proposal on or before the date of the Special Meeting and thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(d) and within 12 months of the date of such termination the Company or the Partnership enters into an agreement providing for, or consummates, a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(h), (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(e) or (iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 6.1(g) and within 12 months of the date of such termination the Company enters into an agreement providing for, or consummates, a Company Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $8,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), minus the amount, if any, previously paid pursuant to Section 6.3(a), which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of same day funds, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) or (iv), on the date of the consummation of such Company Takeover Proposal, and in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), on the date of termination of this Agreement. In no event shall the Termination Fee be paid to Parent pursuant to this Agreement if Parent delivers a Marco Termination Notice or if Parent breaches the covenant contained in Section 6.2(b). 

   

 (c) It is expressly agreed that the Termination Fee to be paid pursuant to this Section 6.3 constitutes liquidated damages negotiated at arms-length and does not constitute, and is not intended by the Parties to operate as, a penalty. Receipt of the Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, REIT Merger Sub, OP Holdco and OP Merger Sub under the events and circumstances giving rise to payment of the Termination Fee as specified in this Agreement, and none of Parent, REIT Merger Sub, OP Holdco or OP Merger Sub shall (i) seek to obtain any other recovery or judgment against the Company or the Partnership or any of their officers, directors, employees, partners, managers, members or 

    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

shareholders or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect or punitive damages. 

   

 (d) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 6.1 or 6.2(a), this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, REIT Merger Sub, OP Holdco, OP Merger Sub, the Company or the Partnership, other than the confidentiality provisions of Section 4.3(c), this Section 6.3 and Article VII, which provisions shall survive such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that such termination results from the willful and material breach by a Party of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement, from the material breach by a Party of any covenant set forth in this Agreement or a breach by Parent of the covenant in Section 6.2(b), then such Party shall be liable for any damages incurred or suffered by the other Parties as a result of such breach.

If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. 

 

  

  

 7.13 _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 6.3(a), each of the Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

 

  

  

 7.14 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Party. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context otherwise requires. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the context requires, words used in the singular shall be construed to mean or include the plural and vice versa, and pronouns of any gender shall be deemed to include and designate the masculine, feminine or neuter gender.
