ARTICLE II

 

 _PURCHASE AND SALE_

 

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing provided for in _Section 3.1_
hereof, Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and
Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from Seller, all of Sellers right,
title and interest in and to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens.

2.2 _Consideration_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment,
transfer



 

10  and delivery of the Shares at the Closing, Buyer shall pay, at the Closing,
to Seller an amount in cash equal to the Net Purchase Price.

 

2.3 _Adjustments to the Net Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Closing Date Adjustment_. The purpose of the purchase price adjustment
set forth in this _Section 2.3_ is to measure any changes in the Cash and
Cash Equivalents, Working Capital and Company Fees and Expenses of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries from the respective target and/or estimated
amounts to the final amounts on the same accounting basis consistently
applied to reflect transactions and/or events up to and conditions existing at
the Closing Date. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an estimated balance sheet for
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a computation of the Cash and Cash
Equivalents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Estimated Closing
Cash and Cash Equivalents_ ") and Working Capital of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") based upon
such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, as well as a listing (including amounts)
of the Company Fees and Expenses which will remain unpaid at the Effective
Time (the " _Estimated Unpaid Company Fees and Expenses_ "). The Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in a manner consistent with (i)
the definitions of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital set forth
herein, and (ii) the methodologies, practices and assumptions used in
preparing the Base Balance Sheet set forth on _Schedule_ I, as applicable and
(iii) GAAP (provided, that in the event of any conflict between GAAP and the
methodologies, practices and assumptions used in preparing the Base Balance
Sheet, the methodologies, practices and assumptions set forth on _Schedule I_
shall govern and control). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the
computations of Estimated Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents and Estimated
Closing Working Capital based upon such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, and
the Estimated Unpaid Company Fees and Expenses shall be conclusive for
purposes of the calculation of the Net Purchase Price payable at the Closing,
but shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing pursuant to this _Section
2.3_.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Determination_. Within sixty (60) calendar days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a balance sheet for
the Company as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), a
computation of the Cash and Cash Equivalents and the Working Capital of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries based upon such Closing Balance Sheet in
a manner consistent with (i) the definitions of Cash and Cash Equivalents and
Working Capital set forth herein, and (ii) the methodologies, practices and
assumptions used in preparing the Base Balance Sheet set forth on _Schedule
I_ , as applicable and (iii) GAAP (provided, that in the event of any conflict
between GAAP and the methodologies, practices and assumptions used in
preparing the Base Balance Sheet, the methodologies, practices
and assumptions set forth on _Schedule_ I shall govern and control) as well
as a listing (including amounts) of the Company Fees and Expenses it
determines were unpaid at the Effective Time. Buyer will make available to
Seller all records and work papers used in preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet, the computation of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital based
upon such Closing Balance Sheet and its listing (including amounts) of the 



 

11  Company Fees and Expenses unpaid at the Effective Time. Seller may, within
thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, deliver
a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Buyer setting forth in reasonable
detail Sellers calculation of the Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working
Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
and Sellers listing (including amounts) of the Company Fees and Expenses
unpaid at the Effective Time. If Seller does not deliver an Objection Notice
within such thirty (30) calendar day period, then Buyers calculations of the
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital based upon the Closing Balance
Sheet shall be deemed to be the Actual Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents and
the Actual Closing Working Capital (as defined below), Buyers listing
(including amounts) of the Company Fees and Expenses unpaid at the Effective
Time shall be deemed to be the Actual Unpaid Company Fees and Expenses (as
defined below). If Seller delivers an Objection Notice to Buyer, then Buyer
and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
any disagreement as to the computation of the Cash and Cash Equivalents and
Working Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time and the Company Fees and Expenses unpaid at the Effective Time,
in each case as soon as practicable, but if they can not reach a final
resolution within thirty (30) calendar days after Buyer has received the
Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller will jointly retain KPMG LLP or, if agreed
by Buyer and Seller, another internationally recognized accounting firm of
comparable stature acceptable to both Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). Buyer and Seller will direct the Accounting Firm to render a
determination within thirty (30) calendar days of its retention and Buyer and
Seller and their respective agents will cooperate with the Accounting Firm
during its engagement. The Accounting Firm will consider only those items and
amounts set forth in the Objection Notice that Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. In rendering its determination, the Accounting Firm shall act as an
expert and not as an arbitrator. The Accounting Firms determination will be
based on such review as the Accounting Firm deems necessary to make its
determination, the definitions of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Working Capital
and Company Fees and Expenses set forth in this Agreement and the
methodologies, practices and assumptions used in preparing the Base Balance
Sheet set forth on _Schedule I_ and the requirements of GAAP (provided, that
in the event of any conflict between GAAP and the methodologies, practices and
assumptions used in preparing the Base Balance Sheet, the methodologies,
practices and assumptions set forth on _Schedule I_ shall govern
and control). The determination of the Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working
Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
by the Accounting Firm, and the calculations by the Accounting Firm of the
Company Fees and Expenses unpaid at the Effective Time, shall be conclusive
and binding upon Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall bear the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm based on the percentage which the portion of
the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by or on behalf of such party. The Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ is referred to herein as the "
_Actual Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents_." The Working Capital of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective

 



 

12  Time as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ is referred to
herein as the " _Actual Closing Working Capital_." The amount of the Company
Fees and Expenses unpaid at the Effective Time as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.3(b)_, is referred to herein as the " _Actual Unpaid
Company Fees and Expenses_." The balance sheet that reflects the computation
of the Actual Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents and the Actual Closing
Working Capital is referred to herein as the " _Actual Closing Balance Sheet_
". The process set forth in this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be the exclusive
remedy of Buyer and Seller for any disputes related to items reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet or covered by the calculation of the Cash and Cash
Equivalents and Working Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and the Company Fees and Expenses unpaid at the Effective Time, whether or
not the underlying facts and circumstances constitute a breach of any
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement.

 

(c) _Payment from Adjustments_.

 

(i) _Payment by the Buyer_. If (A) the Actual Closing Working Capital, _plus_
the Actual Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, _minus_ the Actual Unpaid
Company Fees and Expenses, exceeds (B) the Estimated Closing Working Capital,
_plus_ the Estimated Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, _minus_ the Estimated
Unpaid Company Fees and Expenses (the amount of such excess being the "
_Excess Amount_ "), then the Net Purchase Price will be increased by such
Excess Amount, and Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination thereof, pay to Seller an amount equal to such Excess Amount.
Such payment shall be made to Seller in cash, by cashiers or certified check,
or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated by Seller.

 

(ii) _Payment by Seller_. If (A) the Actual Closing Working Capital, _plus_
the Actual Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, _minus_ the Actual Unpaid
Company Fees and Expenses, is less than (B) the Estimated Closing Working
Capital, _plus_ the Estimated Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, _minus_ the
Estimated Unpaid Company Fees and Expenses (the amount of such deficit being
the " _Deficit Amount_ "), then the Net Purchase Price will be decreased by
such Deficit Amount, and Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination thereof, pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Deficit Amount.
Such payment shall be made to Buyer in cash, by cashiers or certified check,
or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated by Buyer.

 

2.4 _Payoff Letters; Other Pre-Closing Matters_.

 

(a) Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer payoff letters from the lenders with respect to all
Indebtedness for Borrowed Money of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
that will remain unpaid at the Effective Time other than those obligations of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under leases required in accordance
with GAAP to be capitalized on a balance sheet of the lessee that Buyer has
elected to maintain in effect

 



 

13  after the Effective Time and of which Buyer has provided notice to Seller no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing (the " _Continuing
Capitalized Leases_ "). Simultaneously with the Closing, Buyer shall cause
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to repay the entire amount of
outstanding principal and interest with respect to any Indebtedness for
Borrowed Money of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, but excluding the
Continuing Capitalized Leases, in accordance with the payoff letter
instructions provided pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_ by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as directed by the holders of such Indebtedness
for Borrowed Money.

(b) Prior to the Closing, (i) Seller shall assign to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries all of its rights under each of the agreements listed in
_Section 2.4(b)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_ as to be assigned, and (ii)
Seller shall terminate each of the agreements listed in _Section 2.4(b)_
of the _Disclosure Letter_ as to be terminated.

2.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar transaction taxes and fees (including
any penalties and interest), if any, imposed solely and directly by reason of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer when
due, and Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other similar taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable law, Seller will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

2.6 _Parent Guaranty_. Parent, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and
prompt payment, performance or discharge when due of all obligations and
liabilities (including, without limitation, indemnities and fees) of Buyer
now existing or hereafter incurred under, arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). All
payments, performance and discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations by Parent
under this  _Section 2.6_ shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
as payments, performance and discharge of the Guaranteed Obligations by Buyer
under this Agreement. Parent hereby waives notice of any obligation or
liability to which this guaranty may apply, and waives presentment, demand of
payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or
liability, suit or taking of other action by Seller against, and any other
notice to any party liable thereon (including Parent). The obligations of
Parent under this _Section 2.6_ are absolute and unconditional in respect of
satisfying the Guaranteed Obligations and shall be enforceable against Parent
to the extent enforceable against Buyer under this Agreement. The provisions
of this _Section 2.6_ shall not be affected or impaired by any of the
following: (i) the occurrence or continuance of any event of bankruptcy,
reorganization or insolvency with respect to Buyer, or the dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of Parent or Buyer; (ii) the exercise, non-exercise
or delay in exercise, by Seller of any of its rights and remedies under this
_Section 2.6_ or this Agreement generally; (iii) any assignment by Seller or
Buyer of their respective rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement in accordance with the

 



 

14  terms hereof; or (iv) any sale, transfer or other disposition by Parent of
any direct or indirect interest it may have in Buyer.

Subsidiary are duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the ownership, lease or
operation of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than
where the failure to be so duly licensed or qualified has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. _Section 4.1_
of the _Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a list of each Company Subsidiary.
Other than capital stock or other equity interests of the Company
Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other equity interests in or of any Person.

4.2 _Certificates of Incorporation and By-Laws; Corporate Records_. Seller has

each Company Subsidiary its jurisdiction of organization; its authorized,

Company and any Company Subsidiary and the identity of such owner.
Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock or other equity interest
of each Company Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued, is
fully paid and nonassessable and is free of preemptive rights. All such shares
of capital stock or other equity interests of each Company Subsidiary that
are owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary are owned free and clear of
any and all Liens.

rights), agreements, arrangements or commitments to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
or

  

 

16  other equity interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant, issue or sell any
shares of the capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or subjecting any such share of capital stock or other
equity interest to any right of first refusal, right of first offer, tag-along
right, drag-along right or similar right; (ii) there are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the capital stock or

Subsidiary.

4.4 _Authority; Enforceability_. Seller has all requisite power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement
has been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action on
the part of Seller, including Sellers board of directors, and no other
action or corporate proceeding on the part of Seller will be necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller.
This Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Seller
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general equitable principles.

 

4.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement does not, and the
performance by Seller of this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or
violate in any material respect the Organizational Documents of Seller, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate in any
material respect any Laws applicable to Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or by or to which any of their respective properties or assets is
bound or subject or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or
an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default) under, any Material Contract or result in the creation of a Lien on
any of the assets or properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary other
than such breaches, defaults or Liens as would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement will
not require Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to obtain any
material consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing
with or notification to (" _Consent_ "), any Governmental Entity or any third
party, except for (i) applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "); and (ii)
as may be necessary as a result of any fact or circumstance relating solely
to Buyer (including, without limitation, its sources of financing).



 

17 4.6 _Permits; Compliance_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is, and has been since the
Compliance Date, in possession of all material franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents,
certificates, approvals and orders necessary to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business in all material respect as now being
conducted (collectively, the " _Permits_ ") (other than those required under
Environmental Laws, which are governed by _Section 4.14_ hereof), and there
is no material claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened regarding suspension or cancellation of
any such Permits. None of the Permits will lapse, terminate or expire as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have filed all necessary reports and maintained and retained all
necessary records pertaining to the Permits other than where the failure to do
so has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and have been since the
Compliance Date, in compliance in all material respects with all Laws
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section 4.6(b)_ does not apply to employee benefits matters

_Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the unaudited consolidated and fiscal
balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of August 31,

Subsidiaries for the eight-month period ended August 31, 2010 (collectively,

all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
the periods then ended, in each case in conformity with GAAP (except, in the
case of Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, as to normal and recurring
adjustments that were not or are not expected to be in a material amount and
for the lack of footnote disclosure).



 

18 (b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities of any
kind that would have been required to be reflected in or reserved against on
the Base Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP and were not so reflected or
reserved against, other than (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
of business after the date of the Base Balance Sheet, (ii) liabilities
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)
liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Balance Sheet, (a) the Company and each Company Subsidiary has conducted its
business in the ordinary course, consistent in all material respects with past
practice, and (b) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged

4.10 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

 

(a) _Section 4.10(a)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_ contains a list of each
employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (as
hereinafter defined), including but not limited to, each bonus, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option, severance
or termination pay, hospitalization or other medical, life or
other insurance, supplemental unemployment benefits, profit sharing, pension
or retirement plan, program, agreement or arrangement, and each other program,
agreement or arrangement, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required
to be contributed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by any trade
or business, whether or not incorporated (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), that
together with the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (" _ERISA_ "), for the benefit of any employee, retired
employee or terminated employee of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate, whether formal or informal (individually, a " _Plan_ " and,
collectively, the " _Plans_ "). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
nor any ERISA Affiliate has any formal plan or commitment, whether legally



 

19  binding or not, to create any additional Plan or modify or change any
existing Plan (except as required by applicable Law) in a way that would
materially affect any employee, retired employee or terminated employee of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate, nor has any
intention to do any of the foregoing been communicated to any employee,
retired employee or terminated employee of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any ERISA Affiliate.

(b) With respect to each of the Plans, Seller has heretofore made available to
Buyer copies of each of the following documents: (i) a copy of the Plan
(including all amendments thereto); (ii) a copy of the prior two years of

Service with respect to each Plan to the extent applicable; and (v) the most
recent summary plan descriptions with respect to each of the Plans, all of
which have been timely distributed to participants and beneficiaries.

(c) No Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No
liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
except where such failure to satisfy would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and no
condition exists that presents a risk to the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under Title IV of ERISA which
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. Each Plan which is an employee pension plan under
ERISA meets the requirements of a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of
the Code, has received within the last two years a favorable determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to its qualification and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected
to result in disqualification of such Plan.

(d) Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each Plan
has been operated and administered in accordance with its terms and applicable
Law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws
relating to Taxes. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened claims by or on behalf of any of the Plans, by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any such Plan or otherwise involving any such Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).

 

(e) Except as required by applicable Law, no Plan provides benefits, including
death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current
or former employees of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate beyond their retirement or other termination of service.

 

(f) The performance by Seller of this Agreement will not, in any respect, (i)
entitle any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company



 

20  or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
other payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due any such director, officer or employee.

(g) The requirements of COBRA, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, as
amended, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and
any amendment to each such act, and any similar provisions of state law have
been met in all material respects with respect to each Plan to which they have
application, as they relate to employees or former employees of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate.

(h) All contributions and/or premiums (including all Company, Company
Subsidiary and ERISA Affiliate contributions and employee salary reduction
contributions) that are due to have been paid to each such Plan have been paid
to each such Plan or accrued in accordance with the past custom and practice
of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate.

(i) No Plan has been completely or partially terminated or been the subject
of a reportable event under ERISA as to which notices were or would be
required to be filed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. No
proceeding by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to terminate any such
Plan has been instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened.

(j) There have been no prohibited transactions with respect to any such Plan
under ERISA. To the Knowledge of the Seller, no fiduciary has any liability
for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in
connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any such
Plan under ERISA. No action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation with
respect to the administration or the investment of the assets of any such Plan
is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened. No audit, inquiry
or procedure is pending or threatened by the Internal Revenue Service, U.S.
Department of Labor or other Governmental Entity.

 

(k) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any
other members of the controlled group (as defined in the Code) has ever
contributed to, or has ever been required to contribute to, any multiemployer
plan (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)) or has any liability (including
withdrawal liability as defined in ERISA Section 4201 under any multiemployer
plan.

(l) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is a
party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that would reasonably be
expected to result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or
any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Law) or in the payment
of any nonqualified deferred compensation subject to an additional tax under
Section 409A of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or
foreign Law).

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery by Buyer and Parent of this Agreement and the
performance by each of Buyer and Parent of this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action by Buyer and Parent and no other
corporate proceeding on the part of Buyer and Parent is necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and Parent. This
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Buyer and Parent, as
the case may be, enforceable against Buyer and Parent, as applicable, in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles.

 

5.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and Parent does not,
and performance by Buyer and Parent of this Agreement, including the
Financing in connection therewith, will not, (i) conflict with or violate in
any material respect the Organizational Documents of Buyer or Parent, (ii)
conflict with or violate in any material respect any Laws applicable to Buyer
or Parent or by or to which any of Buyers or Parents properties or assets is

agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation
to which Buyer or Parent is a party or by which Buyer or Parent or any of

reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially restrict or impede the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and Parent does not,
and the performance by Buyer and Parent of this Agreement will not, require
Buyer or Parent to obtain any Consent of any Governmental Entity or third

 



 

32  party except for applicable requirements of the HSR Act, and under any
applicable foreign Laws regulating competition.

 

5.4 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Buyer or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates.

action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending or, to
the knowledge of Buyer or Parent, threatened in writing, against Buyer or

aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

5.6 _Sufficient Funds_.

(a) _Exhibit B_ sets forth copies of executed commitment letters from Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse AG, UBS Securities LLC, UBS Loan
Finance LLC, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.
(collectively, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions of which, the lender parties thereto have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Buyer for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Financing_ ").

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full
force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in the
form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to
the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto. There are no other
agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing
Commitments that could affect the availability of the Financing. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer under any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments, and, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Seller set forth herein and compliance
in all material respects by the Seller with _Sections 6.1_ and  _6.11_ ,
Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely
basis, any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it, contained in
the Financing Commitments. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before
the date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth herein and compliance in all material
respects by the Seller with _Sections 6.1_ and _6.11_ , the aggregate
proceeds from the Financing, together will cash and borrowings under existing
credit facilities, and are sufficient for satisfaction of all of Buyers
obligations under this Agreement in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the Net
Purchase Price and the payment of all associated costs and expenses (including
any required refinancing of indebtedness of Buyer, the " _Required Amount_
"). The Financing



 

33  Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of
the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Buyer on the terms
set forth therein. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing
Commitments has been withdrawn and Buyer does not know of any facts or
circumstances that may be expected to result in any of the conditions set
forth in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied. To the extent this
Agreement must be in a form acceptable to any lender providing Financing, such
lender or lenders have approved this Agreement.

 

(c) Buyers obligations under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding Buyers, its Affiliates, or any other Persons ability to obtain
financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.7  _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation any
related financing and the payment of the Net Purchase Price, including any
adjustments thereto pursuant to _Section 2.3_, any repayment or refinancing
of indebtedness contemplated in this Agreement and payment of all related fees
and expenses, and assuming for these purposes the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in  _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ , as of the Effective Time
Buyer shall be Solvent. For the purposes of this _Section 5.7_, the term "
_Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date
of determination, (a) the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person
will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such
Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal
laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on
its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date,
unreasonably small capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date and (c) such Person
will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature.

 

5.8 _Knowledge of Breach_. Buyer has no knowledge of any breach or inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty set forth in  _Article IV_ hereof.

5.9 _Legal Requirements and Approvals_. Buyer has no knowledge of any Consent
of any Governmental Entity that will be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that it will not be able to obtain
or make, or that it may obtain only after substantial delay, or any material
requirement of any Governmental Entity that it will be unable to satisfy in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.10 _Inspection; No Other Representations_. Buyer is an informed and
sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged advisors, experienced in the
evaluation and purchase of companies such as the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken such
investigation and has been provided with and have evaluated such documents and
information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed
decision with respect to the execution, delivery and 



 

34  performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Buyer agrees to accept the Shares without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature, whether in writing, orally or
otherwise, made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller or the Company, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor the Company make
any representation or warranty with respect to (a) any projections, estimates
or budgets delivered to or made available to Buyer of future revenues, future
results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or the future business and operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or (b) any other information or documents made available
to Buyer or its counsel, accountants or advisors with respect to the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, assets,
liabilities or operations, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement.
In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary, Seller has delivered, or made available to Buyer and its
Affiliates, agents and representatives, certain projections and other
forecasts, including but not limited to, projected financial statements, cash
flow items and other data of the Company and Company Subsidiaries relating to
the business of the Company and Company Subsidiaries and certain business plan
information of the Company and Company Subsidiaries. Buyer acknowledges that
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and
other forecasts and plans and accordingly is not relying on them, that Buyer
is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, and that
Buyer and its Affiliates, agents and representatives shall have no claim
against any Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges
that, without limiting the generality of _Section 4.24_, neither Seller nor
any of its representatives, agents or Affiliates (including the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) have made any representation or warranty with
respect to such projections and other forecasts and plans.

least equal to the coverage provided under the Companys or such other
entities current directors and officers liability insurance policies.

claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the

individually or in the aggregate, resulted in non-satisfaction of the closing

event on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month from the date
hereof to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer copies of Sellers

accrue an amount payable to each employee of the Company and the Company

calendar year 2010 through the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is 365. No later than ten (10) Business Days after

respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, attorneys, advisors,
accountants, bankers, agents and representatives to, cease all negotiations
with all third parties (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) related to an
Alternative Transaction and shall not recommence such negotiations unless
this Agreement is terminated.

6.11 _Financing Activities_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller, the Company and their
respective Affiliates have no responsibility for any financing that Buyer may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Financing and the Financing
Commitments, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to
the Financing, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as
practicable but in any event no later than the Closing Date, (iii) consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iv) enforce its rights under
the Financing Commitments. Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of all
documents relating to the Financing and shall keep Seller reasonably informed
of material developments in respect of the financing process relating thereto.
Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment or
modification of, or waiver under, the Financing Commitments or other
documentation relating to the Financing which could reasonably be expected to
adversely effect Buyers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, one or more Financing Commitments
may be amended, modified, supplemented, restated or superseded at the option
of Buyer after the date hereof but prior to the Closing (a " _New Financing
Commitment_ "); provided that the terms of any New Financing Commitment shall
not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, (ii) expand upon the
conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing
Commitment, or (iii) reasonably be expected to delay the Closing. In such
event, the definitions of "Financing Commitments" and "Financing" contained
herein shall be deemed to include any Financing Commitments or documents
related thereto not so amended, modified, supplemented, restated or
superseded, together with the New Financing Commitment. Further, for
the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing (or any alternative financing) has
not been obtained, Buyer shall continue to be obligated to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement subject only to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ and to
Buyers termination rights under _Article X_ , if applicable.

 

(c) If, notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable efforts by Buyer to
satisfy its obligations under  _Section 6.10(b)_, any of the Financing or
the Financing Commitments (or any definitive financing agreement relating
thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part,
for any reason, Buyer shall (i) promptly notify Seller of such expiration or
termination and the reasons therefor and (ii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts promptly to arrange for alternative

 



 

42  financing (" _Replacement Financing_ ") (which shall be sufficient to pay
the Required Amounts from other sources and which do not, without the prior
consent of Seller, include any conditions of such alternative financing that
are more onerous than or in addition to the conditions set forth in the
Financing) to replace the financing contemplated by such expired or terminated
commitments or arrangements.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to provide to Buyer, and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all
out-of-pocket expenses for, all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer that
is necessary, reasonably required or customary in connection with the
Financing, including the following: (i) causing the Companys senior officers
to participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions
(or other sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies),
drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies or other syndication
activities; (ii) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank
information memoranda and similar documents reasonably required in connection
with the Financing; (iii) assisting with the preparation of any pledge and
security documents, any loan agreement, currency or interest hedging
agreement, and other definitive financing documents on terms satisfactory to
Buyer, _provided_ _that_ no obligation of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries under any such document or agreement shall be effective until the
Effective Time; (iv) facilitating the pledging of collateral, _provided_
_that_ no pledge shall be effective until the Effective Time; (v) furnishing
on a confidential basis to Buyer and its financing sources, as promptly as
practicable, such financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Buyer,
including all financial statements and other financial data required by the
Financing Commitments; (vi) furnishing such balance sheets, consolidated
statements of income, cash flow statements and other financial
information for dates and periods, as applicable, subsequent to the Financial
Statements and Unaudited Interim Financial Statements (" _Subsequent Period
Financial Statements_ ") as would customarily be presented in offering
documents to be utilized in connection with a financing substantially similar
to the Financing and to cause the Companys auditors to cooperate in
connection with the preparation of and provide a customary comfort letter to
Buyer and its financing sources; (vii) requesting that the administrative
agent and collateral agent under any existing Indebtedness for Borrowed Money
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries provide a debt payoff letter and
related ancillary agreements; (viii) providing requested officers
certificates and representation letters; (ix) using commercially reasonably
efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts of the financing sources
benefit materially from the existing lending relationships of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; (x) causing the taking of corporate and other
actions by Seller, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to permit the
completion of the Financing; (xi) facilitating the execution and delivery (at
the Closing) of definitive documents related to the Financing; and (xii)
causing to be prepared and rendered requested solvency opinions, accountants
comfort letters, accountants consent letters, surveys, title insurance and
opinions of counsel, in each of the foregoing cases as may be necessary and
customary in connection with a financing substantially similar to the
Financing; _provided_ _that_ , notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, until the Effective Time occurs, neither the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries shall



 

43  (1) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any
liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related document or
any other agreement or document related to the Financing, or (3) be required
to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing contemplated by
the Financing Commitments. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and their respective officers,
employees and representatives, from and against any and all liabilities or
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, except in the
event such liabilities or losses arose out of or result from the willful
misconduct of Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

to, or their ability to retain, any of the business, product lines or assets
of Buyer (or its Subsidiaries), the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

with any Governmental Entity in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of Seller. To the
extent practicable under the circumstances, none of the parties to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any
settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, where permitted, allows the
other party to participate. Subject to applicable legal limitations and

written communication to any Governmental Entity, permit the other party and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other party provided in a timely manner, in
connection with, any such communication; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (y) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the New York
Stock Exchange, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, neither Buyer

Subsidiary not to, issue any public report, statement or press release or
otherwise make any public statement regarding this Agreement or the

and Seller, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, in which case such
party shall advise the other parties hereto and discuss the contents before
issuing any such report, statement or press release.

copies of all books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries

set forth under _Sections 4.1, 4.3(a) and (c), and 4.4_ shall survive
indefinitely. All covenants and other agreements set forth in this Agreement
with respect to matters to occur prior to Closing shall not survive the
Closing and all covenants and other agreements set forth in this Agreement
with respect to matters to occur after Closing shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their respective terms. No claim may be made for
indemnification hereunder for breach of any representations, warranties or
covenants after the expiration of the survival period applicable to such
representation, warranty or covenant set forth above; _provided_ that if
Buyer or Seller, as applicable, delivers written notice to the other party of
an indemnification claim for a breach of the representations, warranties or
covenants (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and legal
basis for, any such claim for indemnification) within the applicable time
periods set forth above, such claim shall survive until resolved or judicially
determined.

 

9.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article IX_ , from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, managers, employees,
stockholders and Affiliates, including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries after the Closing (each a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") from
and against any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, claims, fines and
damages (collectively, " _Damages_ ") asserted against, resulting from,
imposed upon or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party, arising out of or
related to (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty of Seller set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement (without
regard to any qualifiers based on materiality or Material Adverse Effect
contained in the representation or warranty at issue), or (b) any breach of
any covenant or agreement of Seller set forth in this Agreement.

 

9.3 _Seller s Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding _Section 9.2_ or any
other provision of this Agreement: 

(a) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any indemnification
in respect of Damages incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant



 

48  to _Section 9.2(a)_ for any individual item or Claim, or series of related
items or Claims, in which the Damages related thereto are less than $200,000
(any claim exceeding such threshold being referred to herein as a "
_Qualifying Claim_ ");

(b) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
from and against any Damages until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Damages under _Section 9.2(a)_ suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in
respect of Qualifying Claims exceeds an amount equal to $10,000,000 (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "), and then only with respect to Damages under _Section
9.2(a)_ in excess of the Threshold Amount.

 

(c) the aggregate amount of all Damages for which Seller may become liable
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ shall not in any event exceed Fifty Million
Dollars ($50,000,000) (the " _Indemnity Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the limitation of liability set forth in this _Section 9.3(c)_ shall not

any actual fraud on the part of Seller in the negotiation or execution of this
Agreement; and

 

(d) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
with respect to any Damages to the extent reflected or reserved for, or
arising from any matter reflected or reserved for, in the Closing Balance
Sheet or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of the Net Purchase
Price.

 

9.4 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article IX_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller and its directors, officers, managers, employees, members
and Affiliates (each a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and against all
Damages asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon or suffered by any
Seller Indemnified Party, arising out of or related to: (a) any
misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set
forth in _Article V_ of this Agreement; or (b) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Buyer set forth in this Agreement.

9.5 _Notice of Claim_.

 

(a) As used herein, the term " _Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification by
any Buyer Indemnified Party or any Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, for Damages under this _Article IX_ (such Person making a Claim, an "
_Indemnitee_ "). An Indemnitee may give notice of a Claim under this
Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, pursuant
to written notice of such Claim executed by an officer of Buyer (in the case
of a Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party) or Seller (in the case of a Claim by
a Seller Indemnified Party) (a " _Notice of Claim_ "), and delivered to the
other party (such receiving party, the " _Indemnitor_ "), promptly after such
Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any potential Claim by such
Indemnitee for indemnification under this _Article IX_ , but in any event
before the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section
9.1_, arising out of or resulting from:

 



 

49 (i) any item subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of  _Section
9.2_ or _9.4_ ; or

(ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnitee of a
claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding
brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") that arises out of or results from any item subject to
indemnification pursuant to the terms of _Section 9.2_ or _9.4_.

Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnitee shall contain the amount, if known,
claimed, and a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent
reasonably available to the Indemnitee), of the facts, circumstances or events
giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Indemnitees good faith
belief thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant
(to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnitee). Following delivery of
the Notice of Claim (or at the same time if the Indemnitee so elects) the
Indemnitee shall deliver copies of any demand or complaint, the amount of
Damages, the date each such item was incurred or paid or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and the specific nature of the breach to which such
item is related.

9.6 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) The Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim
to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that the failure to timely give such notice
shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder unless
(and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to defend any Third-Party Claim
utilizing legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, and the costs
and expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with such defense shall
be paid by the Indemnitor (and included in determining whether the Indemnity
Cap has been exceeded). The Indemnitee may participate (in the manner and to
the extent set forth below in _Section 9.6(c)_), through counsel of its own
choice and at its own expense, in the defense of any Third-Party Claim.

 

(c) If the Indemnitor elects to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor
shall: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable
diligence and keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of material developments
in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (ii) promptly submit to the
Indemnitee copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other
similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith;
(iii) permit the Indemnitee and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the
defense thereof; and (iv) permit the Indemnitee and its counsel
an opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted prior to their
submission (to the extent practical). Buyer and Seller will make available to
each other and each others counsel and accountants, without charge, all of
its or their books and records relating to the Third-Party Claim (subject to
applicable non-disclosure restrictions



 

50  and privilege claims), and each party will render to the other party such
assistance as may be reasonably required in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection
therewith.

 

(d) If the Indemnitor elects to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor
shall have the right to enter into any settlement of a Third-Party Claim on
the Indemnitees behalf without the consent of the Indemnitee; _provided_ that
(i) in the case of a Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party, the amount to be paid
by the Indemnitee (or by Seller on behalf of the Indemnitee) as a result of
such settlement does not, when added to amounts which have been previously
paid or reimbursed by the Seller pursuant to _Section 9.2_, exceed the
balance of the Indemnitee Cap, (ii) such settlement does not involve any
injunctive or other equitable relief or other covenant to take, or refrain
from, any action, binding upon the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (iii)
such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without
prejudice, and (iv) such settlement does not involve any admission of
liability or fault; _provided_ , _further_ , that no settlement by the
Indemnitor of a Third-Party Claim shall limit or reduce (other than by
application of the Indemnity Cap) the right of any Indemnified Person to
indemnity hereunder for all Damages they may incur arising out of or resulting
from the Third-Party Claim, subject to the provisions of this _Article IX_.

9.7 _Other Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
reduced by the amounts of (i) any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnitee in connection therewith, less the reasonable and documented costs
and expenses of obtaining such insurance proceeds and reasonable projected
increases in insurance premiums arising because of any claim, (ii) any
proceeds actually received from any other third party in connection therewith,
less the reasonable and documented costs of obtaining such proceeds and (iii)
any tax benefits that have been actually realized by the Indemnitee arising
out of indemnifiable Damages. The Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain full recovery under all insurance policies and rights
against any other third party with respect to any Damages. In the event that
an insurance, third party or tax benefit recovery is received by any
Indemnitee with respect to any Damages for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the amount of the recovery, less
the reasonable and documented costs and expenses of obtaining such recovery,
shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor that made or directed and provided
such indemnification payments to such Indemnitee. As used in this _Section
9.7(a)_, "tax benefit" shall mean the Tax savings attributable to any
deduction, expense, loss, credit or refund to the Indemnitee, when actually
realized, net of any Tax detriment associated with the receipt, or right to
receive indemnification hereunder. The amount of any tax benefit actually
realized shall be equal to the actual reduction in Taxes paid in cash
determined with the applicable Tax items taken into account as compared with
the Taxes that would have been payable without the applicable Tax items.

 



 

51 (b) No party shall be entitled to recover under this _Article IX_ with respect
to, and the term "Damages" shall not include, (i) losses relating to any
Claim with respect to Taxes arising as a result of any action by the
Indemnitee the effect of which is to induce a third party to assert a Third-
Party Claim or (ii) LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOST PROFITS, ANY MEASURE OF
DAMAGES BASED ON DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR BASED ON ANY MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OR
EBITDA OR SIMILAR CONCEPT, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EXCEPT IF IN ANY SUCH CASE SUCH
DAMAGES ARE IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD
PARTY PURSUANT TO A FINAL AND NON-APPEALABLE COURT ORDER, IN WHICH CASE THE
RESTRICTIONS OF THIS _SECTION 9.7(b)(ii)_ SHALL NOT APPLY AND THE INDEMNITOR
SHALL BE PERMITTED TO SO RECOVER.

9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. If the Closing occurs, a claim pursuant to _Article
IX_ shall be the Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy as to monetary damages
with respect to any breach of representation or warranty or covenant in this
Agreement, or with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of whether such claim arises in contract, tort, breach of warranty
or any other legal or equitable theory, and shall be limited to the rights
contained in this _Article IX, except in the case of fraud in the inducement
or willful misconduct by Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement_. The rights and limitations of this _Article
IX_ shall not apply to any claim for failure to pay the Net Purchase Price,
including any adjustments thereto pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, and the
parties shall retain all rights and remedies available hereunder or under
applicable Law for such breach. In addition, each party shall be entitled to
specific performance for failure of the other party to perform its
obligations hereunder, except in the case of fraud in the inducement or
willful misconduct by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, as provided in this Agreement.

nonappealable preventing the performance by Buyer or Seller of their
respective obligations under this Agreement;

(c) by Buyer, (i) at any time after December 31, 2010 if the transactions

52  forth in _Section 8.1_ and _8.2_ have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waived other than the condition set forth in
_Section 8.1(b)_ and those conditions that can only be satisfied on the
Closing Date, then the foregoing reference to December 31, 2010 shall be
automatically extended to February 28, 2011, or (ii) at any time, if Seller
shall have breached or violated any of its representations, warranties or
covenants set forth in this Agreement in a manner that would prevent the
satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.2(a) or_,
_Section 8.2(b)_ and (except in the case of a breach of the obligation to
close within two (2) Business Days of the date contemplated in _Section 3.1_,
in which case such two (2) Business Day period shall apply) such breach or
violation shall not have been cured within ten (10) days after written notice
thereof has been given by Buyer to Seller, but subject to the requirements set
forth in _Section 6.6_; or

 

(d) by Seller, (i) at any time after December 20, 2010 if the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur at the Closing shall not have been consummated
for any reason other than the failure of Seller to comply with any covenant or
agreement of Seller, or (ii) at any time, if Buyer shall have breached or
violated any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in
this Agreement in a manner that would prevent the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_, and
(except in the case of a breach of the obligation to close within two (2)
Business Days of the date contemplated in _Section 3.1_, in which case such

their respective partners, officers, directors, Subsidiaries, Affiliates or
Associates to any other party and all rights and obligations of any party
hereto shall cease, except that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto
from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

11.2 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any

extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party or parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party or parties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the
other party or parties with any of the agreements or 



 

54  conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby.

 

11.4 _Headings_. The headings and captions contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

11.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or any
portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the remaining portion thereof, shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any such term or other
provision, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated to the fullest extent possible.

11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto and the _Disclosure Letter_ ) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto and supersede
all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between or
among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

11.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly, by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

 

11.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer
on any person other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement, including any third-party beneficiary rights,
except that (a) current or former directors and officers of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall be third-party beneficiaries of  _Sections
6.5_ and _6.6_ , (b) employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall be third-party beneficiaries of _Section 6.8(c)_, (c) the Retained Firm
shall be a third-party beneficiary of _Section 11.16 _ to the extent it
applies to the Retained Firm, and (d) each Financing Source and its successors
and assigns shall be third-party beneficiaries of _Section 11.11_.

 

11.9 _Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay
on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or
further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights



 

55  and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

 

11.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

Each party hereto acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable
and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by such party and
that any such breach would cause Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, irreparable harm. Accordingly, each party hereto also agrees that,
in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of
this Agreement by such party, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of
posting a bond or other security, including in the form of injunctions and
orders for specific performance. Any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

11.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, its
rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each party hereby agrees and
consents to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery
lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court
having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware,
in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereby irrevocably consents
to the service of any and all process in any such suit, action or proceeding
by the delivery of such process to such party at the address and in the manner
provided in _Section 11.1_ hereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and
for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over
such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the
matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
parties to this Agreement agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing Commitments (or any commitment letter relating to any Replacement
Financing or any New Financing Commitment) or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than any New York State court or Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate
court from any thereof.



 

56 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.11(b).

 

11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

11.13 _Interpretation_. As used in this Agreement, (x) the term "including"
means "including, without limitation" and "including, but not limited to,"
(y) the word "or" is not exclusive, unless the context otherwise requires. All
references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States
Dollars.

11.14 _Costs of Dispute_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event of any dispute between the parties arising under this
Agreement, the party prevailing in that dispute shall be entitled to receive
from the other party reimbursement for its attorneys fees, court costs,
expert witness fees and other similar costs.

11.15 _Fees, Expenses and Other Payments_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including costs of their
respective attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, brokers and other
representatives. All Actual Unpaid Company Fees and Expenses shall be paid by
Buyer, or by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing, to
the parties to whom such Actual Unpaid Company Fees and Expenses are payable.

 

11.16 _Certain Legal Representation Matters_.

 

(a) In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller and its



 

57  equityholders shall have the right, at their election, to retain the firm of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (the " _Retained Firm_ ") to
represent Seller or any of such equityholders in such matter and Buyer hereby
irrevocably consents to, and waives any conflict associated with, any such
representation in any such matter. Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges and
agrees that the Retained Firm has acted as counsel for Seller (and its
Affiliates) and the Company in connection with this Agreement. The parties
agree that the fact that the Retained Firm has represented Seller and the
Company prior to the Closing shall not prevent the Retained Firm
from representing Seller (or any of its Affiliates, including the
equityholders of Seller) in connection with any matters involving this
Agreement, including any disputes between any of the parties hereto that may
arise after the Closing. Buyer and Seller hereby waive any actual or
potential conflict of interest relating to the Retained Firms representation
of the Seller in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but nothing
herein shall require Buyer, the Company or their Affiliates to consent to the
representation of Seller and its Affiliates by the Retained Firm if the
Retained Firms conflict arises out of any matter other than the
representation of the Company prior to the Effective Time).

 

(b) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including after the
Effective Time the Company (and their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, controlling persons and representatives and their
respective successors and assigns), hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that all attorney-client communications between, on the one hand, Seller
and/or the Company (and their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, controlling persons and representatives) and, on the other hand,
their counsel, including without limitation the Retained Firm, that
specifically relate to the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement or any schedule, certificate or other document delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions completed
hereunder or in connection with the Closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be deemed privileged communications as to which such privilege
may only be waived by Seller, and neither Buyer nor any Person purporting to
act on behalf of or through Buyer will seek to obtain any such privileged
communications by any process.
