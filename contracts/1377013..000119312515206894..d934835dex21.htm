(i) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(a)(iii), Section
2.02(a)(iv) and except for Dissenting Shares, each share of Company Stock

accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.03, into the right to
receive the following consideration, without interest (the consideration
referred to in either clause (A) or (B), collectively, as modified by Section
2.02(a)(v) and Section 2.02(a)(vi), the "Company Merger Consideration"): (A)

Stock equal to the Option B Effective Exchange Ratio (the "Company Option B

-17-  shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Company Merger
Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.03(h), in each case to be issued or paid in accordance

(i) Each share of Company Surviving Corporation Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Company Merger Effective Time

right to receive one share of New Charter Common Stock (the "New Charter
Merger Consideration"). As of the Second Company Merger Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Surviving Corporation Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the New

distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(h), in each case to be issued or
paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

(ii) Each membership unit of Merger Subsidiary Two outstanding

immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time (other than any share of
Parent Class A Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(ii))
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive a number of shares
of New Charter Common Stock equal to the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio (the
"Parent Merger Consideration"), and the cash in lieu of fractional shares of
New Charter Common Stock as specified below. As of the Parent Merger
Effective Time, all such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Parent
Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(h), in each case to be issued or paid
in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

 

(ii) Each share of Parent Class A Common Stock held by Parent as

Merger Effective Time shall be canceled and no payment shall be made with

Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) The following procedures shall apply to Elections made pursuant
to Section 2.02(a)(i):

(i) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Election Form"), which shall be mailed by the Company to record holders
of Company Stock and holders of Vested Company Stock Options and Director RSUs
(as such terms are defined in Section 2.04) so as to permit those holders to
exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline and
which shall specify, among other things, the Election Deadline and the
consequences of failing to meet the Election Deadline.

 

(ii) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for (i) receiving Elections
and exchanging for the applicable Company Cash Consideration and New Charter
Merger Consideration (in respect of the applicable Company Stock
Merger Consideration that shall be deemed to be automatically surrendered for
exchange upon the Second Company Merger Effective Time) (as well as cash in
lieu of fractional shares of New Charter Company Stock as specified in Section
2.07) (A) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Company
Certificates") and (B) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Company
Uncertificated Shares"), and (ii) exchanging for the Parent Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of New Charter Company
Stock as specified in Section 2.07 (A) certificates representing shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock (the "Parent Certificates" and, together with the
Company Certificates, the "Cer-

 



-19-  tificates") and (B) uncertificated shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
(the "Parent Uncertificated Shares" and, together with the Company
Uncertificated Shares, the "Uncertificated Shares").

(iii) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as
applicable, not less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline (the "Mailing Date") an Election Form to record holders of Company
Stock as of the close of business on the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to
the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date"). The Company shall make
available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time
to time by all persons who become holders or beneficial owners of Company
Stock during the period following the Election Form Record Date and prior to
the Election Deadline.

 

(iv) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received, by the Election Deadline, an Election Form
properly completed and signed and accompanied by Company Certificates to which
such Election Form relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company and, in the case of
Company Uncertificated Shares, any additional documents specified in the
procedures set forth in the Election Form. As used herein, unless otherwise
agreed in advance by the Company and Parent, "Election Deadline" means 5:00
p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange
Agent is located) on the date that Parent and the Company shall agree is five
(5) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date. The Company and Parent
shall issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing
the anticipated date of the Election Deadline not more than 20 Business Days
before, and at least five Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline. If
the Closing is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be the fifth Business Day
prior to the Closing Date) and the Company and Parent shall cooperate to
promptly publicly announce such rescheduled Election Deadline and Closing.

(v) Any holder of Company Stock may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Election Form or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Company Certificates, or any documents in
respect of Company Uncertificated Shares, previously deposited with the
Exchange Agent. After an Election is validly made with respect to any shares
of Company Stock, any subsequent transfer of such shares of Company Stock
shall automatically revoke such Election. If no Election is made by a holder,
or an Election is revoked and another one is not validly and timely made by a
holder, such holder shall only have the right to receive the Company Option A
Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by
the Exchange Agent of written notification from Parent or the Company that
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article 10_. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine if any Election is not properly or timely made with
respect to any shares of Company Stock (neither Parent nor the Company nor the
Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder of any such
defect);

 



-20-  in the event the Exchange Agent makes such a determination, such Election
shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Stock covered
by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be only entitled to
receive the Company Option A Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms and
conditions hereof, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made with
respect to such shares.

 

(b) At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent or New Charter
shall make, or cause to be made, available to the Exchange Agent the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares (including cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Company Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares as specified in Section 2.07) (the "Exchange Fund"). Each of
Parent and New Charter agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from
time to time, as needed, any dividends or distributions to which any Person
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(h). Promptly after the Effective Time,
and in any event no later than the tenth Business Day following the Effective
Time, New Charter shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of record of shares of Company Stock at the First Company Merger
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (with respect to both
the Company Cash Consideration and New Charter Merger Consideration)
reasonably acceptable to the Company, and to each holder of record of shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock at the Parent Merger Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (with respect to the Parent
Merger Consideration) (which shall, in each case, specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form and shall
include customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message"
regarding the book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares) for use in such
exchange. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange
Fund, as directed by Parent or New Charter, on a daily basis; provided that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $25 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination of the
foregoing. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall
be paid to New Charter upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to this
Section 2.03 and any losses resulting from such investments will be made up
by Parent or New Charter to the extent necessary to pay the Company Cash
Consideration.

 

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Company Merger Consideration and, subsequently,
the New Charter Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Company Uncertificated Shares, the applicable Company Cash
Consideration and the New Charter Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Stock represented by a Company Certificate or Company Uncertificated
Share (in each case as applicable), as specified in such holders Election
Form (or otherwise based on the Company Option A Merger Consideration). The
shares of New Charter

 



-21-  Common Stock constituting part of such New Charter Merger Consideration
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is
required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each Company Certificate or Company Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the First Company Merger Effective Time and the Second Company
Merger Effective for all purposes only the right to receive such Company Cash
Consideration, New Charter Merger Consideration and the right to receive any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(h).

 

(d) Each holder of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Parent Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Parent
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Parent Uncertificated Shares, the Parent
Merger Consideration in respect of the Parent Class A Common Stock
represented by a Parent Certificate or Parent Uncertificated Share (in each
case as applicable). The shares of New Charter Common Stock constituting part
of such Parent Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is required
under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,
each such Parent Certificate or Parent Uncertificated Share shall represent
after the Parent Merger Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive such Parent Merger Consideration and the right to receive any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(h).

 

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(f) (i) After the First Company Merger Effective Time, there shall be
no further registrations of transfers of shares of Company Stock (other than
solely as a result of the First Company Merger or the Second Company Merger),
(ii) after the Second Company Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Surviving Corporation Stock
(other than solely as a result of the Second Company Merger) and (iii) after
the Parent Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (other than solely as a
result of the Parent Merger). If, after the First Company Merger Effective
Time, the Second Company Merger Effective Time or the Parent Merger Effective
Time, as applicable, Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or uncertificated
shares of Company Surviving Corporation Stock are presented to the Company
Surviving Corporation, New Charter, the Parent Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Company Cash
Consideration and the New Charter Merger Consideration or Parent Merger
Consideration, as applicable, provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 



-22- (g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock or Parent Class A Common Stock twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to New Charter, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock or
Parent Class A Common Stock for the applicable Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to New Charter for and New Charter shall remain liable for, payment of
the applicable Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(h), in respect of such shares without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties to
this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock or
Parent Class A Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock or Parent
Class A Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of New Charter free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of
New Charter constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.07, shall be
paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any
Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as
provided in this Section 2.03. Following such surrender or transfer, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities
of New Charter have been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or
transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which
such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07 and the amount of
all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to
such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to
surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities.

 

(i) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred by a holder of Company Stock or Parent Class
A Common Stock in connection with the First Company Merger, the Second Company
Merger or the Parent Merger, as applicable, for which none of Parent, New
Charter, the Company, or a Subsidiary of the Company is liable, and the filing
of any related Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes
and fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such holder. 

Section 2.04 _Company Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 2.04(d), the terms of each
outstanding compensatory option to purchase shares of Company Stock (a
"Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be
adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Second Company Merger Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the First
Company Merger Effective Time shall be converted into an option (each, a
"Company

 



-23-  Adjusted Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the First
Company Merger Effective Time, the number of shares of New Charter Common
Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the First Company
Merger Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with
any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares.
The exercise price per share of New Charter Common Stock subject to any such
Company Adjusted Option shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the First Company Merger Effective Time divided by (B)
the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional cents rounded up to
the next higher number of whole cents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
conversion of a Company Stock Option in accordance with the preceding
provisions of this Section 2.04(a) would cause the related Company Adjusted
Option to be treated as the grant of new stock right for purposes of Section
409A of the Code, such Company Stock Option shall not be converted in
accordance with the preceding provisions but shall instead be converted in a
manner reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company that would not cause
the related Company Adjusted Option to be treated as the grant of new stock
right for purposes of Section 409A.

 

(b) Except as provided in Section 2.04(c) and Section 2.04(d), the
terms of each outstanding restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit with
respect to shares of Company Stock (a "Company RSU"), whether or not vested,
shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Second Company Merger
Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior to the First
Company Merger Effective Time shall be converted into a restricted stock unit
(each, a "Company Adjusted RSU") with respect to, and on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company RSU immediately prior to the
First Company Merger Effective Time, the number of shares of New Charter
Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the First Company Merger
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares.

 

(c) At or promptly after the Second Company Merger Effective Time, each
outstanding Company RSU (each, a "Director RSU") held by a non-employee
director or former non-employee director of the Company (each, a "Director"),
whether or not vested, shall be canceled, and New Charter shall pay each
such Director at or promptly after the Second Company Merger Effective Time
for each such Director RSU an amount in cash computed by first determining the
Company Adjusted RSU that such Director would have received if the Director
RSU held by such Director was converted into a Company Adjusted RSU pursuant
to the methodology described in Section 2.04(b) (each, a "Notional Adjusted
RSU") and then multiplying (i) the quotient of (A) the closing sale price of
a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading day
immediately preceding the First Company Merger Effective Time divided by (B)
the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio by (ii) the number of shares of New Charter
Common Stock subject to the Notional Adjusted RSU.

(d) (i) At or promptly after the Second Company Merger Effective Time,
each outstanding Company Stock Option (each, a "Former Employee Option") held
by a former employee or individual contractor of the Company (each, a "Former
Employee"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled, and New
Charter shall pay each such Former Em-

 



-24-  ployee at or promptly after the Second Company Merger Effective Time for
each such Former Employee Option an amount in cash computed by first
determining the Company Adjusted Option that such Former Employee would have
received if the Former Employee Option held by such Former Employee was
converted into a Company Adjusted Option pursuant to the methodology described
in Section 2.04(a) (each, a "Notional Adjusted Option") and then multiplying
(A) the excess of (1) the quotient of (I) the closing sale price of a share of
Parent Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading day immediately preceding
the First Company Merger Effective Time divided by (II) the Parent Merger
Exchange Ratio over (2) the per share exercise price of such Notional Adjusted
Option, if any, by (B) the number of shares of New Charter Common Stock
subject to such Notional Adjusted Option to the extent unexercised. For the
avoidance of doubt, all Former Employee Options outstanding as of the First
Company Merger Effective Time that if converted into a Company Adjusted Option
would have a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the quotient of
(x) the closing sale price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ
on the trading day immediately preceding the First Company Merger Effective
Time divided by (y) the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio shall be immediately
cancelled and forfeited without any liability on the part of Parent, New
Charter or their respective Affiliates.

 

(ii) At or promptly after the Second Company Merger Effective Time,
each outstanding Company RSU (each, a "Former Employee RSU") held by a Former
Employee, whether or not vested, shall be canceled, and New Charter shall pay
each such Former Employee at or promptly after the Second Company
Merger Effective Time for each such Former Employee RSU an amount in cash
computed by first determining the number of Notional Adjusted RSUs held by
such Former Employee and then multiplying (A) the quotient of (1) the closing
sale price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading
day immediately preceding the First Company Merger Effective Time divided by
(2) the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio by (B) the number of shares of New
Charter Common Stock with respect to the Notional Adjusted RSUs; provided,
that, to the extent that any Former Employee RSU is subject to Section 409A of
the Code, then such Former Employee RSU shall be converted into a Company
Adjusted RSU in accordance with the terms of Section 2.04(b).

(e) Parent and New Charter shall take such actions as are necessary for
the assumption of the Company Stock Options and Company RSUs pursuant to
Sections 2.04(a) and (b), including the reservation, issuance and listing of
New Charter Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.04. Parent and New Charter shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the
1933 Act, with respect to the shares of New Charter Common Stock subject to
the Company Adjusted Options and Company Adjusted RSUs to be issued by New
Charter and, where applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement covering such Company Adjusted Options and Company
Adjusted RSUs (and to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained
therein) for so long as any Company Adjusted Option or any Company Adjusted
remains outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who,
subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, New
Charter shall administer any Company Adjusted Option and any Company Adjusted
RSU issued pursuant to this Section 2.04 in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to the extent the corresponding Company
Stock Option or such Company RSU complied with such rule prior to the Mergers.

 



-25- (f) Prior to the First Company Merger Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall take any actions with respect to equity compensation plans or
arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.04.

 

Section 2.05 _Parent Equity-Based Awards_. (a) The terms of each
outstanding compensatory option to purchase shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock (each, a "Parent Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested,
shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Parent Merger Effective
Time, each Parent Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time shall be converted into an option (each, a "Parent
Adjusted Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Parent Stock Option immediately prior to the Parent
Merger Effective Time, the number of shares of New Charter Common Stock equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
subject to such Parent Stock Option immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of shares. The
exercise price per share of New Charter Common Stock subject to any such
Parent Adjusted Option shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (A)
exercise price per share of Parent Class A Common Stock subject to such Parent
Stock Option immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time divided
by (B) the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio, with any fractional cents rounded up
to the next higher number of whole cents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the conversion of a Parent Stock Option in accordance with the preceding
provisions of this Section 2.05(a) would cause the related Parent Adjusted
Option to be treated as the grant of new stock right for purposes of Section
409A of the Code, such Parent Stock Option shall not be converted in
accordance with the preceding provisions but shall instead be converted in a
manner reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company that would not cause
the related Parent Adjusted Option to be treated as the grant of new stock
right for purposes of Section 409A.

 

(b) The terms of each outstanding award of shares of restricted Parent
Stock (each, a "Parent Stock Award") shall be adjusted as necessary to
provide that, at the Parent Merger Effective Time, each Parent Stock Award
outstanding immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time shall be
converted into an award (each, a "Parent Adjusted Stock Award") with respect
to, and subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Parent Stock Award immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, the
number of shares of restricted New Charter Common Stock equal to the product
of (i) number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock subject to such Parent
Stock Award immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time multiplied
by (ii) the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded
down to the next lower whole number of shares.

 

(c) The terms of each outstanding restricted stock unit with respect to
shares of Parent Stock (each, a "Parent RSU"), whether or not vested, shall
be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Parent Merger Effective Time,
each Parent RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Parent Merger Effective
Time shall be converted into a restricted stock unit (each, a "Parent
Adjusted RSU") with respect to, and on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Parent RSU immediately prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, the number of shares of New Charter Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock subject to
such Parent RSU immediately prior to the Parent

 



-26-  Merger Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio,
with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower whole number of
shares.

 

(d) Parent and New Charter shall take such actions as are necessary for
the assumption of the Parent Stock Options, Parent Stock Awards and Parent
RSUs pursuant to Sections 2.05(a), (b) and (c), including the reservation,
issuance and listing of New Charter Common Stock as is necessary to effectuate
the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. New Charter shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a
post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under
the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of New Charter Common Stock subject
to the Parent Adjusted Options, Parent Adjusted Stock Awards and Parent
Adjusted RSUs to be issued by New Charter and, where applicable, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement
declared effective as soon as practicable following the Parent Merger
Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement covering such Parent Adjusted Options, Parent Adjusted Stock Awards
and Parent Adjusted RSUs (and to maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein) for so long as any Parent Adjusted Option,
Parent Adjusted Stock Award or Parent Adjusted RSU remains outstanding. With
respect to those individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section
16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, New Charter shall administer any
Parent Adjusted Option, Parent Adjusted Stock Award and Parent Adjusted
RSU issued pursuant to this Section 2.05 in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to the extent the corresponding Parent
Stock Option, Parent Stock Award or Parent RSU complied with such rule prior
to the Mergers. 

(e) Prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall take any actions with respect to equity compensation plans or
arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.05.

 

Section 2.06 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the First Company Merger Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, or any other similar event, but excluding any change that
results from (a) the exercise of stock options or other equity awards to
purchase shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Company Stock or the
settlement of restricted stock units or deferred stock units or (b) the grant
of equity-based compensation to directors or employees of Parent or, subject
to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company under
Parents or the Companys, as applicable, equity compensation plans or
arrangements, the Merger Consideration, amounts payable under Section 2.04 and
any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted.

Section 2.07 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Company
Surviving Corporation Stock shall be issued in the First Company Merger and no
fractional shares of New Charter Common Stock shall be issued in the Parent
Merger. All fractional shares of Company Surviving Corporation Stock that a
holder of record of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a result of the First Company Merger shall be aggregated and if a

 



-27-  fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest
determined by multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Class A
Common Stock on NASDAQ on the trading day immediately preceding the First
Company Merger Effective Time by the fraction of a share of Company Surviving
Corporation Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.
All fractional shares of New Charter Common Stock that a holder of record of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive
as a result of the Parent Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional
share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to
receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by
multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock
on NASDAQ on the trading day immediately preceding the Parent Merger
Effective Time by the fraction of a share of New Charter Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

 

Section 2.08 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Parent
Surviving Entity, the Company Surviving Corporation, Merger Subsidiary One,
Merger Subsidiary Two, Merger Subsidiary Three, New Charter and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct or withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct
or withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax law. The Company shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, assist Parent, New Charter, Parent Surviving Entity,
Company Surviving Corporation, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two
and/or Merger Subsidiary Three in making such deductions and withholding
as reasonably requested by Parent or New Charter. If the Exchange Agent, the
Company, the Parent Surviving Entity, the Company Surviving Corporation,
Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two, Merger Subsidiary Three, New
Charter or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and timely pays
such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Stock or Parent Class A Common, as applicable, in
respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Parent Surviving Entity,
the Company Surviving Corporation, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary
Two, Merger Subsidiary Three, New Charter or Parent, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.09 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by New Charter or the Company Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as New Charter and the
Company Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock or
Parent Class A Common Stock represented by such Certificate and any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(h), as
contemplated by this Article 2.

 

Section 2.10 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and
to the extent available under Delaware Law, shares of Company Stock that are
outstanding imme-

 



-28-  diately prior to the First Company Merger Effective Time and that are held
by holders of shares of Company Stock who shall have neither voted in favor of
the First Company Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares of Company Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the
Company Merger Consideration (or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Cheetah
Merger Consideration). The holders of such shares of Company Stock shall be
entitled instead to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of
Delaware Law, except that all Dissenting Shares held by holders of shares of
Company Stock who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company
Stock under Section 262 of Delaware Law shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the First
Company Merger Effective Time, the right to receive the Company Merger
Consideration (which shall represent, with respect to the Company Stock
Merger Consideration, the right to receive the New Charter Merger
Consideration), in each case without any interest thereon, in accordance with
Section 2.02.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent and New Charter (i) prompt notice of
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.

 

Section 2.11 _Restructuring_. If such actions required to treat the
Companys Subsidiaries as disregarded from their owner for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or contribute the Companys assets and interests in its
Subsidiaries to Subsidiaries of New Charter following the Closing Date would
result in a cost that is material to Parent, then, upon the written request
of Parent, the Parties agree to reasonably cooperate in the implementation of
a restructuring of the transactions contemplated herein (including, without
limitation, restructuring such transaction such that the Second Company
Merger, the Parent Merger, the equity subscription and exchange contemplated
by the Investment Agreement and Contribution Agreement, respectively, and the
contribution of the assets subject to the Amended Contribution Agreement to
New Charter, taken together, would be treated as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Code). Such cooperation shall include entering into
appropriate amendments to this Agreement, provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.11 to the contrary, such
cooperation contemplated by this Section 2.11 shall (a) not (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the consideration ultimately to be issued to the
holders of Company Stock or the holders of Parent Class A Common Stock or
(ii) reasonably be expected to (x) subject to the proviso in clause (b) below,
adversely affect the Company or the holders of Company Stock or (y) have the
effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
regulatory approvals required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or the Closing and (b) result in U.S. federal income tax consequences
that are no less favorable to the holders of Company Stock and the holders of
Parent Class A Common Stock than the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the Mergers; provided that it is agreed and understood that for purposes of
this Section 2.11 a transaction qualifying as a transaction described in
Section 351 of the Code does not result in tax consequences that are less
favorable to the holders of Company Stock and the holders of Parent Class

 



-29-  A Common Stock than the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers
and does not adversely affect the Company or the holders of Company Stock.

SEC Documents") or (b) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the

corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those Governmental Authorizations the absence of which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure
to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date

complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.02 _Corporate Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby are within the Companys corporate powers and, except for the required
approval of the Companys stockholders in connection with the consummation of
the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is
the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the First Company Merger and the Second Company Merger. This
Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, New
Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two, Merger Subsidiary
Three, and the Voting Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Liberty Broadband, constitute valid and binding agreements of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective
terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors
rights generally and general principles of equity).

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors has (i) unanimously determined
that this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously resolved,
subject to Section 6.03(b), to recommend adoption of this Agreement by its
stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation").

Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the Communications Act, (iv)
authorizations from state public utility commissions and similar state
authorities having jurisdiction over the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (v) compliance with any state statutes or local franchise
ordinances and agreements,

 



-31-  (vi) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934
Act and any other applicable state or federal securities laws, (vii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") and (viii) any actions or filings the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or materially interfere with or delay the
consummation of the Mergers.

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not
and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section
4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent or other action by any Person
under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit
the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license,
franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization
affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien,
other than any Permitted Lien, on any asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii)
through (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially interfere with
or delay the consummation of the Mergers.

Section 4.05 _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 8,333,333,333 shares of Company Stock and 1,000,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01, of the Company ("Company Preferred
Stock"). As of May 21, 2015, there were outstanding (A) 282,752,157 shares of
Company Stock, (B) Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 2,734,928

respect to an aggregate of 5,190,285 shares of Company Stock, (D) no shares of
Company Preferred Stock and (E) no shares of restricted Company Stock

and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any equity compensation plan or
arrangement will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms
thereof, duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any Company Securities.

 

(b) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote on an as-converted basis
(or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote. As of May
21, 2015, except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and except for changes
since such date resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options or the
settlement of Company RSUs, in each case outstanding on such date, there are
no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (i) shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in

 



-32-  the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or other ownership
interests in the Company, (iii) warrants, calls, options or other rights to
acquire from the Company, or other obligation of the Company to issue, any
shares of capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or other voting securities of or other
ownership interests in the Company or (iv) restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights issued or granted by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in the
Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to collectively
as the "Company Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Securities. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has sponsored an employee stock purchase plan. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any voting trust, proxy, voting agreement or
other similar agreement with respect to the voting of any Company Securities.

(c) The shares of Company Surviving Corporation Stock to be issued as
part of the Merger Consideration have been duly authorized and, when issued
and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will have been
validly issued and will be fully paid and nonassessable and the issuance
thereof is not subject to any preemptive or other similar right.

Section 4.06 _Subsidiaries_. (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is an
entity duly incorporated or otherwise duly organized, validly existing and
(where applicable) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, except where the failure to be so incorporated,
organized, existing or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company has all corporate, limited liability
company or comparable powers and all Governmental Authorizations required to
carry on its business as now conducted, except for those powers or
Governmental Authorizations the absence of which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company 10-K identifies, as of its
filing date, all "significant subsidiaries" (as defined under Rule 1-02(w) of
Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the 1934 Act) of the Company (each, a
"Significant Subsidiary") and their respective jurisdictions of organization.

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of
or other ownership interests in each Subsidiary of the Company, are owned by
the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of
any other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right
to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting
securities or other ownership interests). There are no issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary
of the Company, (ii) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any

 



-33-  shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or other ownership
interests in or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, any
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or other ownership
interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights issued or granted by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or
other voting securities of or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of
the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to
collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary Securities.

 

(c) Section 4.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the
date of this Agreement, each Person other than a Subsidiary of the Company in
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock or
other voting securities or other ownership interests, other than (i) publicly
traded securities held for investment which do not exceed 5% of the
outstanding securities of any Person and (ii) securities held by any employee
benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any trustee or other
fiduciary in such capacity under any such employee benefit plan (each, a
"Company Investment"). All of the capital stock or other voting securities of
or other ownership interests in each Company Investment that are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, are owned by the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all Liens and any other limitation
or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or other ownership interests), except Liens under Applicable Law
and restrictions on transfer set forth in the agreements governing any such
Company Investment.

 

Section 4.07 _SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act_. (a) The Company
has filed with or furnished to the SEC (including following any extensions of
time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the 1934 Act) all
reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses, registration statements
and other documents required to be filed or furnished by the Company since
January 1, 2012 (collectively, together with any exhibits and schedules
thereto and other information incorporated therein, the "Company SEC
Documents").

 

(b) As of its filing date (or as of the date of any amendment filed
prior to the date hereof), each Company SEC Document complied, and each
Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act
and the 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each
Company SEC Document filed or furnished pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and
each Company SEC Document filed or furnished subsequent to the date hereof
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading in any material respect.

 

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of
the date such registration

 



-34-  statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
any material respect.

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably effective in timely
alerting the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in the
Companys periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 under the 1934 Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal

a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Representations and Warranties of Parent

 

Subject to Section 11.05, except (a) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents
(as defined below) filed or furnished by Parent with the SEC since January 1,
2014 and before the date of this Agreement (the "Specified Parent SEC
Documents") or (b) as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent
represents and warrants to the Company that:

 

Section 5.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary One is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
corporate powers and all Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for those Governmental Authorizations the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of New Charter and
Merger Subsidiary Two is a limited liability company duly organized validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all limited liability company powers and all Governmental
Authorizations required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those Governmental Authorizations the absence of which would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, Parent
has delivered or made available to the Company true and complete copies of the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and the organizational
documents of New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two and
Merger Subsidiary Three as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Since the
date of their respective incorporation or formation, Merger Subsidiary One,
Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger Subsidiary Three have not engaged in any
activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.02 _Corporate Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary

corporate and other organizational powers of Parent, New Charter, Merger
Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger Subsidiary Three, as
applicable, and, except for (i) the required approval of Parents stockholders
in connection with the Parent Merger, the New Charter Stock Issuance and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Equity Exchange and the
Equity Purchase), (ii) the approval of Parent as the sole stockholder of New
Charter in connection with the Second Company Merger and New Charter Stock
Issuance, and (iii) the approval of New Charter as the sole member of Merger
Subsidiary Two in connection with the Parent Merger, have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate and other organizational action on the part of
Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger
Subsidiary Three. The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock are the only votes of the holders of
Parent Class A Common Stock necessary in connection with the approval of the
Parent Merger. The approvals set forth in Section 5.02(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule are the only approvals

 



-48-  required by the holders of Parents capital stock (collectively, the "Parent
Stockholder Approval"). Following the First Company Merger Effective Time, no
vote or approval of the former holders of capital stock of the Company is
required in connection with the other Mergers. This Agreement, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of each of Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One,
Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger Subsidiary Three, enforceable against Parent,
New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger
Subsidiary Three in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity).

Subsidiary Ones Board of Directors has unanimously determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the
best interests of Parent and its stockholders and unanimously approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

performance by Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary
Two and Merger Subsidiary Three of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger
Subsidiary Three of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by
or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i)

Section 5.15 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 5.15(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a
correct and complete list identifying each material "employee benefit plan,"
as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each material employment contract,
material severance contract or plan and each other material plan or agreement
providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, equity compensation or
other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, insurance (including any
self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits, post-employment or
retirement benefits (including compensation, pension, health, medical or life
insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered or contributed to by
Parent or any ERISA Affiliate and covers any current or former employee,
director or other independent contractor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or with respect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
any liability, other than a Multiemployer Plan. Copies of such plans (and, if
applicable, related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and
all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof have been
furnished to the Company together with the most recent annual report (Form
5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990)
prepared in connection with any such plan or trust and the most recent
Internal Revenue Service determination letter for any such plan, to the extent
applicable. Such plans (disregarding all materiality qualifiers in this
Section 5.15(a)), excluding any Multiemployer Plan, are referred to
collectively herein as the "Parent Plans."

(b) No Parent Plan (for the avoidance of doubt, other than any
Multiemployer Plan) that is subject to Title IV of ERISA has any unfunded
liabilities as of the date of this Agreement. The aggregate underfunded or
unfunded, as applicable, liability for all Parent Plans that are "excess
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(36) of ERISA) or that provide deferred
compensation, computed using the actuarial assumptions used for the purposes
of determining any liability under such Parent Plan for purposes of the
Parent SEC Documents, is not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability on account of a "complete
withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (within the meaning of Sections 4203 and
4205 of ERISA, respectively) from any Multiemployer Plan and, to Parents
knowledge, no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such withdrawal (including as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Neither Parent nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has received notice of any Multiemployer Plans (i) failure to
satisfy the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or
application for or receipt of a waiver of such minimum funding re-

 



-57-  quirements, (ii) "endangered status" or "critical status" (within the
meaning of Section 432 of the Code) or (iii) insolvency,
"reorganization" (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA) or proposed
or, to Parents knowledge, threatened termination. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, all contributions, surcharges and premium payments
owed by Parent and its ERISA Affiliates with respect to each Multiemployer
Plan have been paid when due.

 

(d) Each Parent Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter. Each Parent
Plan (for the avoidance of doubt, other than a Multiemployer Plan) has been
established and operated in compliance with its terms and with all Applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any
employee, director or other independent contractor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
material compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Parent Plan. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former employee, director or
other independent contractor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for any Tax
incurred by such individual, including under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees, directors or other independent
contractors of Parent or its Subsidiaries except as required to avoid excise
tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

 

(g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by Parent or any of its Affiliates
relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, a Parent Plan which
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(h) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding
pending against or involving or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against or involving, any Parent Plan before any Governmental Authority,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no Person has been
treated as an independent contractor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for
tax purposes, or for purposes of exclusion from any Parent Plan, who should
have been treated as an employee for such purposes.

(j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) none of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries has breached or otherwise failed to comply with the
provisions of any Collective Bargaining

 



-58-  Agreement and there are no grievances or arbitrations outstanding
thereunder, and (ii) there are no formal organizational campaigns, corporate
campaigns, petitions, demands for recognition via card-check or, to the
knowledge of Parent, other unionization activities seeking recognition of a
bargaining unit at Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, there are no unfair labor practice charges,
grievances, pending arbitrations or other complaints or union representation
questions before the National Labor Relations Board or other labor board of
Governmental Authority that would reasonably be expected to affect the
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

(k) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there are no current or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened strikes, slowdowns or work stoppages,
and no such strike, slowdown or work stoppage has occurred within the three
years preceding the date hereof.

 

Section 5.16 _Franchises_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (a)
the Cable Systems owned or operated by Parent and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the applicable Franchises in all material respects and (b)
there are no material ongoing or, to Parents knowledge, threatened audits or
similar proceedings undertaken by Governmental Authorities with respect to any
of the Franchises of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.17 _Tax Treatment_. Neither Parent nor New Charter, nor any of
their respective Affiliates, has taken or agreed to take any action or is
aware of any fact or circumstance that would prevent the Mergers from
qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment.

Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Liberty Broadband Corporation, Liberty

case excluding any programming agreements and any other commercial agreements
negotiated on an arms-length basis.

(b) As of the date hereof, except as provided to the Company in
accordance with Section 5.18(a), neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is

Company, or any of the Companys material assets, other than the Bright House
Transactions, the Equity Purchase and the Equity Exchange.

Section 5.19 _Finders  Fees_. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co.
and LionTree LLC, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries who might be entitled to

 



-59-  any fee or commission from Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.20 _Opinion of Financial Advisors_. Parents Board of Directors
has received the separate opinions of Goldman, Sachs and Co. and LionTree LLC,
each a financial advisor to Parent, to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, (a) the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point
of view to the holders of Parent Class A Common Stock (excluding certain
holders) and (b) the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to Parent, respectively.

Section 5.21 _Financial Ability_. Parent has delivered to the Company a
true, complete and correct copy of executed commitment letters, dated as of
May 23, 2015, and the executed fee letters related thereto dated as of May 23,
2015 (in the case of such fee letters, with only fee amounts and certain
economic terms (none of which would adversely affect the aggregate amount
(other than in respect of upfront fees) or availability of the Debt Financing
if so exercised by the lenders party thereto) redacted) (in each case, as the
same may be amended or replaced in accordance with Section 8.12, and
including all exhibits, schedules and annexes attached to any of the
foregoing, the "Debt Commitment Letter") from the Financing Sources party
thereto, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, the Financing Sources have committed to provide the amount of
debt financing stated therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Debt Financing").

(a) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
9.01 and Section 9.02, as of the Closing Date, Parent or New Charter shall
have, or have available to either of them, sufficient funds to pay the Company
Cash Consideration, to pay all other cash amounts payable to the holders
of shares of Company Stock upon consummation of the First Company Merger in
accordance with the terms hereof and to pay all fees and expenses in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Required Payment
Amount").

 

(b) Other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
there are no other agreements, side letters, arrangements or understandings
(except for customary fee credit letters and engagement letters, in each case
associated with the Debt Financing, each of which does not (i) impair the
enforceability of the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing, (iii) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing or (iv) otherwise adversely expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing) relating to the
financing of the Required Payment Amount. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing, except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in the form so
delivered to the Company as of the date hereof.

(c) The Debt Commitment Letter in the form so delivered to the Company
is in full force and effect and represents the legally valid and binding
obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
applicability relating to 

 



-60-  or affecting creditors rights, and by general equitable principles). As of
the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, rescinded
or terminated or otherwise amended, restated, modified or waived in any
respect, and no such withdrawal, rescission, termination, amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver is contemplated. Parent is not in breach
of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
and, as of the date hereof and to the knowledge of Parent, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure to satisfy
any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date hereof, no
Financing Source has notified Parent of its intention to terminate the Debt
Commitment Letter or not to provide the Debt Financing. Parent has paid in
full any and all commitment or other fees or other amounts that are required
to be paid in connection with the Debt Financing on or prior to the date
hereof.

necessary to exempt the Second Company Merger, the Parent Merger, this
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby from Section 203
of Delaware Law and any similar provisions contained in its certificate of
incorporation, and, accordingly, neither such Section nor any other
antitakeover or similar statute, regulation or provision of its certificate of
incorporation applies or purports to apply to any such transactions. No other
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover
laws enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two, Merger Subsidiary
Three, Company Surviving Corporation, Merger Subsidiary Two Surviving Entity,
or Parent Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries will have
incurred liabilities (including contingent liabilities) beyond its ability to
pay such liabilities as they mature or become due, (b) the then present fair
salable value of the assets of each of New Charter, Merger Subsidiary Two

and matured, (c) the assets of each of New Charter, Merger Subsidiary Two

Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries will have
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business as presently conducted or
as proposed to be conducted.

Section 5.24 _No Additional Representations_. Except for
the representations and warranties made by Parent in this Article 5, none of
Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two or Merger
Subsidiary Three or any other Person makes any express

 



-61-  or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities,
conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Parent, New

Three hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties.
In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, none of Parent, New
Charter, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two or Merger Subsidiary

(t) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 6.02 _Company Stockholder Meeting_. The Company shall cause a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") to be duly
called and held as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement (but in no event later than 40 days after the Registration Statement
is declared effective under the 1933 Act) for the purpose of voting on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Company Mergers. In connection
with the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall (i) subject to Section 6.03, (1) recommend approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Company Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby by the Companys stockholders and (2) use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has terminated in accordance with its
terms, this Agreement and the Company Mergers shall be submitted to the
Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting whether or not (x)
the Companys Board of Directors shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) any Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to the Company or any of
its advisors. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ that
the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Company
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B)
after consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
Applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (C) after consultation with Parent, for
a single period not to exceed ten Business Days, to solicit additional proxies
if necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, or (D) if the Company
has delivered to Parent a bona fide notice contemplated by Section 6.03(c),
for a maximum of ten Business Days. Parent may require the Company to adjourn,
delay or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting once for a period not to
exceed 30 calendar days (but prior to the date that is two Business Days
prior to the End Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Once the Company has established a record date
for the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record
date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by Applicable Law or the
Companys organizational documents. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Company Mergers) shall be the only matter (other than
matters of proce-

 



-66-  dure and matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Companys
stockholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall propose to be acted
on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Section 6.03 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

(a) _General Prohibitions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize
or permit any of its or their officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors
("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take
any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions
(other than to state that the Company is not permitted to have discussions) or
negotiations with any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party
that is seeking to make, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (v) fail to enforce or grant
any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect
to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
unless the Board of Directors of the Company determines after consulting
with its outside legal counsel that the failure to waive such provision would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_
that the Company shall not enforce and hereby waives any provision of any such
agreement that would prohibit a Third Party from communicating confidentially
a Company Acquisition Proposal to the Companys Board of Directors, (vi)
approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law or (vii) enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating
to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement to
the extent contemplated by Section 6.03(b)); _provided_ that (so long as the
Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied in all material
respects with this Section 6.03) none of the foregoing shall prohibit the
Company and its Representatives from, at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval, participating in discussions with any Persons or group
of Persons who has made a Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement solely to request the clarification of the terms and conditions
thereof so as to determine whether the Company Acquisition Proposal is, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal, and any
such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 6.03(a). It is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section
6.03 by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
a breach of this Section 6.03 by the Company.

(b) _Recommendation Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a),
but subject to Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(d), at any time prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval:

 

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Third Party

 



-67-  that, subject to the Companys compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made
after the date of this Agreement a Company Superior Proposal or a Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal by the Third
Party making such Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) furnish to such Third
Party and its advisors, agents or other intermediaries (including financing
sources) non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (a copy of
which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such
Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained
in the confidentiality agreement, dated May 23, 2015, between the Company and
Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (it being understood and hereby
agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a "standstill" or
similar provision that prohibits such Third Party from making any
Company Acquisition Proposal, acquiring the Company or taking any other
action); _provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or as
promptly as practicable (but no later than 24 hours) after the time it is
provided or made available to such Third Party) and (C) take any action
required by Applicable Law or that any court of competent jurisdiction orders
the Company to take;

(ii) following receipt of a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 

(iii) following a Company Intervening Event, the Board of Directors of
the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to such Company
Intervening Event;

 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) only if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after considering advice from outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law. For purposes of clarification, the taking of any of the actions permitted
by Section 6.03(a) and Section 6.03(b)(i) shall not be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from (i) complying with Rule 14a-9, Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act (or making any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with any amendment to the terms
of a tender offer or exchange offer) so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03 or (ii) disclosing
factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of Parent or the Company or the fact that a Company Acquisition
Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the
material terms of such proposal in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
otherwise, to the extent the Company in good faith determines that such
information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed under
Applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that any such action
taken or statement or disclosure made that relates to a Com-

 



-68-  pany Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or disclosure or in
connection with such action (except that a mere "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the 1934 Act or failure to take
a position with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal governed by the
tender offer or exchange offer rules under the 1934 Act until the tenth
Business Day after commencement of such Company Acquisition Proposal shall not
constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
not take any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b) unless the Company
shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall,
if such action is in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal, continue
to advise Parent on a current basis of the status and terms of any discussions
and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal,
any written indication from a Third Party that such Third Party is considering
making a Company Acquisition Proposal or any written request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has indicated that it is considering
making, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall within
24 hours of receipt thereof provide such notice orally and in writing and
shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions
of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent
copies of all material correspondence and written materials sent or provided
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or
conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and details
of any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Any material
amendment to any Company Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Companys compliance with
this Section 6.03(c).

 

(d) " _Last Look_ ". The Board of Directors of the Company shall
not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company
Acquisition Proposal unless (i) such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Company Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in
writing at least five Business Days before taking that action, of its
intention to do so, attaching the most current version of the proposed
agreement under which such Company Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the Company
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) Parent does not make, within such five-
Business-Day period after its receipt of that written notification, an offer
that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such
Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Company Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company and a new
period under clause (ii) of this Section 6.03(d), except that such period
shall be three Business Days instead of five Business Days). The Board of
Directors of the Company shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Company Intervening Event, unless (A) the Company has
provided Parent with written information describing such Company Intervening
Event in reasonable detail promptly after becoming aware of it and keeps 

 



-69-  Parent fully informed, on a reasonably current basis, of material
developments with respect to such Company Intervening Event, (B) the Company
has provided Parent at least five Business Days prior notice of its intention
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Company
Intervening Event, attaching a reasonably detailed explanation of the facts
underlying the determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that a
Company Intervening Event has occurred and its need to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in light of the Company Intervening Event and (C) Parent
does not make, within such five-Business-Day period, an offer that
the Companys Board of Directors determines would obviate the need for a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in light of the Company Intervening
Event. During any five-Business-Day period prior to effecting a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.03(d), the Company
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. 

(e) _Definition of Company Superior Proposal_. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Company Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited
written Company Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or substantially all of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel and taking into account all material financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal, including the terms and conditions of the
Company Acquisition Proposal, (x) is on terms and conditions more favorable to
the Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated hereby (taking
into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.03(d)) and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated
and, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), has financing, if
any, that is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by
the Board of Directors of the Company.

 

(f) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly
request that each Third Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality
agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection
with its consideration of any Company Acquisition Proposal return or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains,
reflects or analyzes that information), and the Company shall provide to
Parent all certifications of such return or destruction from such other
Persons as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure all such certifications as
promptly as practicable. If any such Person fails to provide any required
certification within the time period allotted in the relevant confidentiality
agreement (or if no such period is specified, then within a reasonable time
period after the date hereof), then the Company shall take all actions that
may be reasonably necessary to secure its rights and ensure the performance
of such other partys obligations thereunder as promptly as practicable.

 



-70- Section 6.04 _Tax Matters_. (a) From the date hereof until the Second
Company Merger Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any
material Tax election, change any annual tax accounting period, adopt or
change any method of tax accounting, file any material amended Tax Returns or
claims for material Tax refunds, enter into any material closing agreement,
surrender any material Tax claim, audit or assessment, surrender any right to
claim a material Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability,
consent to any extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any
Tax claim or assessment or take or omit to take any other action with respect
to Taxes, in each case, if any such action or omission would have the effect
of materially increasing the Tax liability or accrual of Tax liability under
FASB Interpretation No. 48 or materially reducing any Tax asset or accrual of
Tax asset under FASB Interpretation No. 48 of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause
to be established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Second Company
Merger Effective Time an adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to
any period or portion thereof ending prior to or as of the Second Company
Merger Effective Time.

 

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value
added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Mergers (including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall
be paid by the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary) when due, and the
Company (or the applicable Subsidiary) shall, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes
and fees, and, if required by Applicable Law, the Company (or the applicable
Subsidiary) shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of
any such Tax returns and other documentation.

 

Section 6.05 _Voting of Shares_. The Company shall vote all shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any such shares held by
any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
trustee or other fiduciary in such capacity under any employee benefit plan)
in favor of the Parent Merger, the New Charter Stock Issuance, the Equity
Exchange, the Equity Purchase, the Stockholders Agreement (as defined in the
Amended Contribution Agreement) and any related matters (including
any matters subject to the Cheetah Stockholder Approval (as defined in the
Amended Contribution Agreement)) at the Parent Stockholder Meeting or any
other meeting of Parent stockholders.

 

Section 6.06 _Bright House Right of First Offer_. The Company and Time
Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates
and any successors in interest) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive
all of their respective rights under Section 8.3 of the Third Amended and
Restated Partnership Agreement of Time Warner Entertainment-Advance /
Newhouse Partnership, dated as of December 31, 2002 (the "Bright House
Partnership Agreement"), with respect to the combination of Bright House
Networks, LLC and New Charter, irrespective of any termination of this
Agreement; provided that the foregoing waiver shall not be applicable
following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms so
long as the Company or any of its Affiliates has not entered into any
agreement or un-

 



-71-  derstanding providing for, or consummated, any Company Acquisition Proposal
within nine (9) months following the termination of this Agreement. In the
event that the foregoing waiver is not applicable, this Section 6.06 shall be
without prejudice to any Partys (or any of their Affiliates) interpretations
of or positions with respect to the matters the contemplated by Section 8.3 of
the Bright House Partnership Agreement. For purposes of this Section 6.06,
the term "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 1.01, except that all references to "25%" therein shall
be deemed to be references to "50%".

required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (C)
after consultation with the Company, for a single period not to exceed ten
(10) Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval or the Cheetah Stockholder Approval (as defined in
the Amended Contribution Agreement), or (D) if Parent has delivered to the
Company a bona fide notice contemplated by Section 7.04(b), for a maximum of
ten Business Days. The Company may require Parent to adjourn, delay or
postpone the Parent Stockholder Meeting once for a period not to exceed 30
calendar days (but prior to the date that is two Business Days prior to the
End Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Once Parent has established a record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Parent Stockholder Meeting without
the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by Applicable Law or
Parents organizational documents.

Section 7.04 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

(a) _General Prohibitions_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, nor shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or
permit any of its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the
submission of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate
in any discussions (other than to state that Parent is not permitted to have
discussions) or negotiations with any Third Party that is seeking to make, or
has made, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish any non-public
information relating to the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party
that is seeking to make, or has made, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, (v) fail to enforce or grant any
waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any class of equity securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries unless
the Board of Directors of Parent determines after consulting with its outside
legal counsel that the failure to waive such provision would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided that Parent shall not
enforce and hereby waives any provision of any such agreement that would
prohibit a Third Party from communicating confidentially a Parent Acquisition
Proposal to the Parents Board of Directors, (vi) approve any transaction
under, or any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203
of Delaware Law or (vii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement
or other similar instrument relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement to the extent contemplated by Section
7.04(b)); _provided_ that (so long as Parent and its Representatives have
otherwise complied in all material respects with this Section 7.04) none of
the foregoing shall prohibit Parent and its Representatives from, at any time
prior to the Parent Stockholder Approval, participating in discussions with
any Persons or group of Persons who has made a Parent Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Parent Acquisition

 



-74-  Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Superior
Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 7.04(a).
It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on Parent set forth in
this Section 7.04 by any Representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be a breach of this Section 7.04 by Parent.

 

(b) _Recommendation Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a),
but subject to Section 7.04(c) and Section 7.04(d), at any time prior to the
Parent Stockholder Approval:

 

(i) Parent, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Third Party that, subject to Parents compliance with Section 7.04(a), has
made after the date of this Agreement a Parent Superior Proposal or a Parent
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal by the Third Party making such
Parent Acquisition Proposal, (B) furnish to such Third Party and its
advisors, agents or other intermediaries (including financing sources) non-
public information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for
informational purposes only to the Company) with such Third Party with terms
no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood and hereby agreed that such confidentiality
agreement need not contain a "standstill" or similar provision that prohibits
such Third Party from making any Parent Acquisition Proposal, acquiring Parent
or taking any other action); _provided_ that all such information (to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided or made
available to the Company) is provided or made available to the Company, as the
case may be, prior to or as promptly as practicable (but no later than 24
hours) after the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party)
and (C) take any action required by Applicable Law or that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders Parent to take;

 

(ii) following receipt of a Parent Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance with Section 7.04(d), make a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 

(iii) following a Parent Intervening Event, the Board of Directors of
Parent may, subject to compliance with Section 7.04(d), make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to such Parent Intervening Event;

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) only if
the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after considering
advice from outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. For purposes
of clarification, the taking of any of the actions permitted by Section
7.04(a) and Section 7.04(b)(i) shall not be deemed to be a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change.

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent Parent or its Board of
Directors from (i) complying with Rule 14a-9, Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) and
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act (or making any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with

 



-75-  any amendment to the terms of a tender offer or exchange offer) so long as
any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this
Section 7.04 or (ii) disclosing factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Parent or the Company or the
fact that a Parent Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the
party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or otherwise, to the extent Parent in good
faith determines that such information, facts, identity or terms is required
to be disclosed under Applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;
_provided_ that any such action taken or statement or disclosure made that
relates to a Parent Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of Parent
reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation in such statement or disclosure or
in connection with such action (except that a mere "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the 1934 Act or failure to
take a position with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal governed by the
tender offer or exchange offer rules under the 1934 Act until the tenth
Business Day after commencement of such Parent Acquisition Proposal shall not
constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors of Parent shall not take
any of the actions referred to in Section 7.04(b) unless Parent shall have
delivered to the Company a prior written notice advising the Company that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, Parent shall, if
such action is in connection with a Parent Acquisition Proposal, continue to
advise the Company on a current basis of the status and terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, Parent shall
notify the Company promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by Parent (or any of its Representatives) of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, any written indication from a Third Party that such Third Party is
considering making a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any written request for
information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has indicated that it is considering
making, or has made, a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall within 24
hours of receipt thereof provide such notice orally and in writing and shall
identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any
such Parent Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly
(but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to the Company
copies of all material correspondence and written materials sent or provided
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions
of any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and details of any such
Parent Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Any material amendment to
any Parent Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Parent Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of Parents compliance with this Section 7.04(c).

 

(d) " _Last Look_ ". The Board of Directors of Parent shall not make
a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal unless (i) such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent
Superior Proposal, (ii) Parent promptly notifies the Company, in writing at
least five Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to do
so, attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement under which
such Parent Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity
of the Third Party making the Parent Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) the
Company does not make, within such five-Business-Day period after its receipt
of that written notification, an offer to revise the terms of

 



-76-  this Agreement that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of Parent
as such Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Parent
Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from Parent and a
new period under clause (ii) of this Section 7.04(d), except that such period
shall be three Business Days instead of five Business Days). The Board of
Directors of Parent shall not make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Parent Intervening Event, unless (A) Parent has provided the
Company with written information describing such Parent Intervening Event in
reasonable detail promptly after becoming aware of it and keeps the Company
fully informed, on a reasonably current basis, of material developments with
respect to such Parent Intervening Event, (B) Parent has provided the Company
at least five Business Days prior notice of its intention to make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Parent Intervening Event,
attaching a reasonably detailed explanation of the facts underlying the
determination by the Board of Directors of Parent that a Parent Intervening
Event has occurred and its need to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
in light of the Parent Intervening Event and (C) the Company does not make,
within such five-Business-Day period, an offer to revise the terms of this
Agreement that Parents Board of Directors determines would obviate the need
for a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in light of the Parent Intervening
Event. During any five-Business-Day period prior to effecting a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 7.04(d), Parent and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the Company and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by the Company.

(e) _Definition of Parent Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Parent Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written
Parent Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock or all or substantially all of the
consolidated assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries that the Board of Directors
of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and
taking into account all material financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal, including the terms and conditions of the Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (x) is on terms and conditions more favorable
to Parents stockholders than the transactions contemplated hereby (taking
into account any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.04(d)) and (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated
and, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), has financing, if
any, that is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by
the Board of Directors of Parent.

 

(f) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall promptly request
that each Third Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement
within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its
consideration of any Parent Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other
materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or
analyzes that information), and Parent shall provide to the Company all
certifications of such return or destruction from such other Persons as
promptly as 

 



-77-  practicable after receipt thereof. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to secure all such certifications as promptly as
practicable. If any such Person fails to provide any required certification
within the time period allotted in the relevant confidentiality agreement (or
if no such period is specified, then within a reasonable time period after the
date hereof), then Parent shall take all actions that may be reasonably
necessary to secure its rights and ensure the performance of such other
partys obligations thereunder as promptly as practicable.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement and the Contribution
Agreement or the Bright House Transactions shall not be deemed to be a Parent
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise be subject to the provisions of this Section
7.04.

 

Section 7.05 _Approval by Sole Members of New Charter, Merger Subsidiary
Two and Merger Subsidiary Three_. Immediately following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto, Parent shall cause the sole
members of New Charter, Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger Subsidiary Three to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Mergers, in accordance with Delaware
Law, by written consent.

Section 7.06 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, any such shares held by any employee benefit plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any trustee or other fiduciary in such
capacity under any employee benefit plan) in favor of adoption of this
Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

Section 7.07 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. (a) From and after
the Effective Time, New Charter shall indemnify and hold harmless and provide
advancement of expenses to, the present (as of the date hereof or any time
prior to the Effective Time) and former officers and directors of the Company
and Parent, respectively, and their respective Subsidiaries and any
individual who is as of the date of this Agreement or commences, prior to the
Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company or Parent, respectively,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another
Person (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of (i) acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the fact that such
Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer, or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or Parent (as applicable) or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person prior to
the Effective Time and (iii) this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys or
Parents (as applicable) or their respective Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or comparable organizational documents in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification and advancement of
expenses shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under
Applicable Law; provided, further, that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent
required by Applicable Law.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, New Charter shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in its and each of its Subsidiaries
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and comparable organizational
documents (or in such documents of any successor to the business of each of
the parties hereto, as applicable) regarding elimination of liability of
direc-

 



-78-  tors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement
of expenses with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement
in the Companys, Parents and such Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation
and bylaws and comparable organization documents, as applicable.

(c) New Charter shall either (i) continue to maintain in effect for
six years after the Effective Time the Companys and Parents (as applicable)
directors and officers insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date hereof or
(ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period, in each case
with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time with coverage not less than the existing coverage and other
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as those contained in the DandO Insurance in effect as of the date
hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall New Charter be required to expend
for such policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate premium amount in
excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company or Parent (as applicable)
paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section
7.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to the Company and
Section 7.07 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to Parent; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, New Charter shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.
At the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective
Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" with coverage not less than the
existing coverage and other terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in the DandO
Insurance in effect as of the date hereof, in which event New Charter shall
cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section
7.07(c); _provided_ that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not
exceed 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal
year. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy," New
Charter shall maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect and
continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder.

(d) If New Charter or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, New Charter shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of New Charter shall assume the applicable obligations
of such party set forth in this Section 7.07.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.07 shall
be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the
Company Mergers and the Parent Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



-79- Section 7.08 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of New Charter Common Stock to be issued as
part of the Merger Consideration to be listed on NASDAQ, subject to official
notice of issuance.

 

Section 7.09 _Employee Matters_ (a) New Charter shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who continues to be employed by New Charter or its Subsidiaries (including,
for the avoidance of doubt the New Charter and its Subsidiaries) immediately
following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), other than any
Continuing Employee included in a collective bargaining unit during the
Continuation Period (each, a "Represented Employee"), with, to the extent
employed by New Charter or its Subsidiaries, (i) during the period beginning
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time (the "Continuation Period"), base pay and annual cash bonus
opportunities, as applicable, that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) during the Continuation Period, commission and cash
incentive opportunities that are no less favorable than either those provided
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date or
those provided to similarly situated employees of New Charter or its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, and (iii) until December 31, 2016,
employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than provided
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that, for purposes of determining whether such pay, opportunities
and benefits are no less favorable in the aggregate, long-term cash incentive
compensation, equity compensation, defined benefit pension plan benefits,
severance, retention (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any supplemental
cash bonus opportunity paid or payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Companys terminated merger agreement
with Comcast Corporation), sale, stay, or change in control payments or awards
or any similar compensation or benefit, shall not be taken into account. With
respect to Represented Employees, New Charter shall retain, or shall cause to
be retained, any and all of the rights and obligations it may have pursuant to
Applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.09(a), beginning on the Closing Date, New
Charter shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, for the benefit of
each Continuing Employee, other than any Represented Employee, (i) honor all
contracts providing for severance to the extent and in accordance with their
terms and (ii) honor, without amendment, all plans providing for severance
for the Continuation Period or for any longer period during which such
amendments are prohibited under the terms of the applicable plan, in all
cases, as long as such contract or plan is set forth on Section 7.09 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. It is intended that Section 7.09(a) and this
Section 7.09(b) shall not result in any duplication of benefits to any
Continuing Employee.

 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.09(a), beginning on the Closing Date, New
Charter shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, for the benefit of
each Continuing Employee, other than any Represented Employee, honor, without
amendment, all compensation plans, arrangements, or agreements set forth on
Section 7.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule for the Continuation Period
or for any longer period during which such amendments are prohibited under the
terms of the applicable plan, in all cases, as long as such contract or plan
is set forth on Section 7.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



-80- (d) To the extent that Continuing Employees, other than Represented
Employees, become eligible to participate in any "employee benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by New Charter or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "New Charter Plans"), then, for purposes of
determining (i) eligibility to participate and vesting and, (ii) solely with
respect to any New Charter Plan that provides for severance, vacation or paid-
time off benefits, for purposes of benefit accrual, service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
service with New Charter or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent recognized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits and the New Charter
shall not be required to provide credit for such service for eligibility,
vesting or benefit accrual purposes under any New Charter Plan that is an
equity compensation plan, defined benefit pension plan or postretirement
medical plan. In addition, subject to the terms of the applicable New Charter
Plan and legal requirements applicable to such New Charter Plan, New Charter
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees
under any New Charter Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which such
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time
and (y) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
New Charter Plans that are welfare plans in which such Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and to the extent required by any
Company Plan or Applicable Law, New Charter shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, expressly assume such Company Plan and all obligations
thereunder.

 

(f) Upon the request of Parent prior to the Effective Time but after
the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefits of such conditions, effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate or shall
cause the termination of any or all U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution
plans provided to current and former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as directed by the Parent and in compliance with Applicable Law.

 

(g) Parent and the Company shall coordinate in good faith to develop a
mutually agreed communications strategy with respect to employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Employee Communication Strategy"). Except
for communications that are substantially in accordance with the Employee
Communication Strategy, (i) without the prior written consent of the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, contact, meet or otherwise
communicate with any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, either on an individual or group basis and (ii) Parent shall
provide the Company with a reasonable right to comment on and approve (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) any written
communications by the Parent intended for distribution (whether individual or

 



-81-  broad-based) to current or former directors, officers or employees of the
Company or its Affiliates prior to the Closing regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing contained
in this Section 7.09, expressed or implied, shall (i) be treated as the
establishment, amendment or modification of any Company Plan or New Charter
Plan or, subject to compliance with the requirements of Sections 7.09(a) and
7.09(b), constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge or
terminate after the Effective Time any Company Plan or New Charter Plan, (ii)
give any current or former employee, director or other independent contractor
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof), any third-party beneficiary or other rights or (iii) obligate New
Charter or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Plan
or New Charter Plan or (B) retain the employment or services of any current
or former employee, director or other independent contractor.

Section 7.10 _Certain Agreements_.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), none of Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One,
Merger Subsidiary Two, Merger Subsidiary Three or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall enter into, amend, modify or terminate any agreements,
arrangements or understandings with Liberty Broadband Corporation,
Liberty Interactive Corporation, John Malone or any of their respective
Affiliates, in each case, if such amendment, modification or termination would
reasonably be expected to (i) have the effect of materially delaying,
impairing or impeding the receipt of any regulatory approvals required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the Closing or (ii)
have a disproportionately adverse impact on the stockholders of the Company
relative to the stockholders of Parent.

 

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), none of Parent, New Charter, Merger Subsidiary One,
Merger Subsidiary Two, Merger Subsidiary Three or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall enter into, amend, modify or terminate any of the material
agreements relating to the Bright House Transactions, including the Bright
House Contribution Agreement or the Amended Contribution Agreement, in each
case, if such amendment, modification or termination would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the
receipt of any regulatory approvals required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Closing.

Section 7.11 _Tax Treatment_. Parent shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries (including Merger Subsidiary Two) not to, make an election
under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 to treat Merger Subsidiary Two
as an association taxable as a corporation or take any other action that would
cause Merger Subsidiary Two to be treated as other than a disregarded entity
for both state and federal income Tax purposes.

Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
supply, and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Affiliates to supply, as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
foregoing, and use its reasonable best efforts to take, and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its respective Affiliates to take, all
other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods regarding the foregoing as soon as practicable.

 

(c) Parent shall take the lead with respect to (i) the scheduling of,
and strategic planning for, any meeting with any Governmental Authority under
the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law, (ii) the making of any filings under
the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law, (iii) the process for the receipt of
any necessary approvals and (iv) the resolution of any investigation or other
inquiry of any such Governmental Authority. Without limiting the foregoing
sentence, except as prohibited by Applicable Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall, and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Affiliates to (A) to the extent reasonably practicable,
consult with each other prior to taking any material substantive position with
respect to the filings under the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law in
discussions with or

 



-83-  filings to be submitted to any Governmental Authority, (B) to the extent
reasonably practicable, permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with respect to filings under
the HSR Act or any other Applicable Law, and (C) to the extent reasonably
practicable, coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such
information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of
all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Authority relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or
any other Applicable Law.

 

(d) Unless prohibited by Applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to cause its respective Affiliates to, (i) to the extent
reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage
in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of
the Mergers (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in
Section 8.01(a)) without the other ( _provided_ that, subject to Section
8.01(c), either party may participate in or attend any such non-substantive
meeting), (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable
prior notice of any such meeting or conversation and (iii) in the event one
party is prohibited by Applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority from participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any
such conversation, keep such party reasonably apprised with respect thereto;
_provided_  that, Parent or its representatives may conduct such a meeting or
conversation without the Company or its representatives present upon the prior
written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereto understand and agree that "reasonable best efforts" shall
require Parent to take any actions and accept any conditions and other
remedies to the extent such actions, conditions or other remedies would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets or
results of operations of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole (but without taking into account the Bright House Transactions,
whether or not consummated) (each such condition, remedy or action that Parent
is not required to accept or take under this Section 8.01(e), a "Burdensome
Condition"). The Company agrees to work in good faith in connection with
Parents efforts to obtain the regulatory approvals consistent with this
Section 8.01 in a manner that Parent believes in good faith is in the best
interests of the combined company and its shareholders. In addition, the
Company shall not accept any of the conditions or take any of the foregoing
actions (whether or not consistent in scope and magnitude with such prior
conditions and actions) without Parents prior written consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be required to commit to or
effect any action contemplated by this Section 8.01(e) or accept any condition
that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers.

 

(f) Each of Parent and the Company shall not, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, (i) take any action that would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any regulatory approvals required in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or the Closing, or (ii) acquire or agree
to acquire (by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or
otherwise), direct-

 



-84-  ly or indirectly, any assets, securities (other than securities issued by
such party as permitted by Section 6.01 or Section 7.01, as the case may be),
properties, interests or business in any transaction or series of related
transactions, if such acquisition would (A) require approval of the FCC, or
(B) (without the consent of the other, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) have a value, or involve the payment of
consideration, in excess of $350 million; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
nothing in this Agreement (including the foregoing sentence) shall prohibit
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from consummating the Bright
House Transactions and no reasonable actions taken in furtherance of the
Bright House Transactions shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
(including this Section 8.01) and (y) nothing in this Agreement shall limit
the ability of Parent or its Subsidiaries from bidding on or purchasing
wireless spectrum to the extent it would not reasonably be expected to have
the effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any
regulatory approvals required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Closing.

(g) Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section 8.01 as information that may be reviewed only
by outside counsel. Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and, subject to
any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement the parties may
mutually propose and enter into, will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the
Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 8.01, materials provided to the
other party or its outside counsel may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning valuation, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

Section 8.02 _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement_.
(a) As promptly as practicable, the Company, New Charter and Parent shall
prepare and file the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration
Statement (in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included)
with the SEC. The Company, New Charter and Parent shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the
1933 Act as soon after such filing as practicable and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include, subject to Section
6.03, the Company Board Recommendation and, subject to Section 7.04, the
Parent Board Recommendation. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one
another in (x) setting a mutually acceptable date for the Company Stockholder
Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting, so as to enable them to occur, to
the extent practicable, on the same date and (y) setting the dates for their
respective annual meetings of stockholders. The Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be mailed to its respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement becomes effective. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Registration Statement and
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus comply as to form in all material
respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act, respectively.

 



-85- (b) The Company and Parent shall make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the 1933
Act and the 1934 Act and applicable state "blue sky" laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other
parties and their respective counsel with (i) any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, that such party or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, as applicable,
promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response to those comments.

 

(d) No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without
the approval of the other parties hereto, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that (i) the Company, in
connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance
with the terms hereof may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to an
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
extent it contains (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) a
statement of the reason of the Companys Board of Directors for making such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (C) additional
information reasonably related to the foregoing, and (ii) Parent, in
connection with a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with
the terms hereof may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to an amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains
(A) a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) a statement of the reason of
Parents Board of Directors for making such Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, and (C) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.
Each party will advise the other parties, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of New Charter Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Registration Statement. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or the Company discovers any information relating to any party, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement, so that none of those documents would include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements in any such document, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers that
information shall promptly notify the other party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing that information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law or regulation, disseminated to
the shareholders and stockholders, respectively, of Parent and the Company.

 

Section 8.03 _Public Announcements_. (a) Except with respect to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change made in accordance with this Agreement, or Parents or the Companys
(as applicable) response thereto, or any communication made in accordance with
Section 6.03 or Section 7.04, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
their Subsidiaries to, consult with each other before issuing any

 



-86-  press release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press
conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except for
any public statement or press release as may be required by Applicable Law,
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or any listing agreement with or
rule of any national securities exchange or association, shall not, and shall
cause their Subsidiaries not to, issue any such press release, make any such
other public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference
call before that consultation and providing each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon any such press release or public statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any press
release or other public statement to the extent it contains substantially the
same information as previously communicated by one or more of the parties.
The initial press release of the parties announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be a joint press release of Parent and the Company in a form
that is mutually agreed.

 

(b) Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (as applicable) made in accordance with
this Agreement, or Parents or the Companys (as applicable) response thereto,
or any communication made in accordance with Section 6.03 or Section 7.04
(as applicable), before any Merger Communication of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective "participants" (as defined in Rule 165 of the 1933 Act
or Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the 1934 Act) is (i) disseminated to any
investor, analyst, member of the media, employee, client, customer or other
third party or otherwise made accessible on the website of the Company, Parent
or any such participant, as applicable (whether in written, video or oral form
via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any officer, senior
manager, key employee or advisor of the Company, Parent or any such
participant, as applicable, as a script in discussions or meetings with any
such third parties, then, in each case, the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, shall (or shall cause any such participant to) cooperate in good faith
with respect to any such Merger Communication for purposes of, among other
things, determining whether that communication (x) is required to be filed
under Rules 165 and 425 of the 1934 Act or (y) constitutes "soliciting
material" that is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of
the 1934 Act, as applicable, by the Company, Merger Subsidiary One, Merger
Subsidiary Two, Merger Subsidiary Three, New Charter or Parent, as applicable,
and shall (or shall cause any such participant to) give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by the other such party or parties
and their counsel on any such Merger Communication; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not apply to any Merger Communication that (I)
contains substantially the same information as has previously been
communicated by such Person or (II) relates to the Bright House Transactions.
For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Merger Communication" shall mean,
with respect to any Person, any document or other written communication
prepared by or on behalf of that Person, or any document or other material or
information posted or made accessible on the website of that Person (whether
in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), that is
related to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if
reviewed by a relevant stockholder, could reasonably be deemed to constitute
either (x) an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy Parent Class
A Common Stock (or New Charter Common Stock) or (y) a "solicitation" of
"proxies" (in each case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the 1934 Act) in favor of
the Company Merger, the Parent Merger or the New Charter Stock Issuance.

Corporation, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of

nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be construed to, prevent
or restrict Parent and its Affiliates entering into and performing to the
Amended Contribution Agreement (including consummating the Bright House
Transactions), and such entry into and performance thereof shall not be deemed
to be a breach of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that there is any new consideration of the
application of law or the parties organizational documents to the

faith with their respective legal advisors and implement a restructuring of
the process to achieve requisite completion in the most expeditious and

any of such partys representations or warranties, as the case may be, or that
are material and relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

_provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.05 shall

Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall (i) upon reasonable advance notice,
give to the other party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and

applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the
required consent of any such Third Party to provide such access or
disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to
address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company
and (3) in the case of clauses (A) and (C), enter into a joint defense
agreement or implement such other techniques if the parties determine that
doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without
violating Applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.

 

Any investigation pursuant to this Section 8.06 shall be conducted in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
the other party. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation

representation or warranty made by any party hereunder.

qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and (iii) the Parent Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and shall not take any action reasonably likely
to cause the Mergers not so to qualify or be treated. Provided the opinion

with the Intended Tax Treatment.

reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would
cause to be un-

 



-89-  true (or fail to take or cause to take any action which would cause to be
untrue) any of the Tax Representation Letters.

 

Section 8.08 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the First Company Merger

with respect New Charter Common Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by Article 2 by each individual who is subject to the reporting

conditioned or delayed). Without limiting in any way the parties obligations
under Section 8.01, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate, shall

satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) materially
less likely to occur in any respect or (z) adversely impact the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment

this  _Section 10.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated

but rather is a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, New Charter and
Merger Subsidiary One, Merger Subsidiary Two and Merger Subsidiary Three in
the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision, and (ii) neither the Parent Termination Fee nor the
Parent Regulatory Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which the
Parent Termination Fee or the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee (as

and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Mergers,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and such termination
gives rise to the obligation of Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee or
the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee and Parent shall have paid the Parent
Termination Fee or the Parent Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable,
pursuant to this Section 10.02, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Company Related Parties") against Parent and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates and any
Financing Source, together with each Financing Sources Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, equityholders, partners,
controlling parties, advisors, agents and representatives, and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "Financing Related
Parties") for any demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments,
losses, damages, liabilities, diminution in value, costs and expenses,
including interest, penalties

 



-101-  and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, in each case on a basis net of
any actual benefit resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection
with, this Agreement (including termination thereof) or any transactions
ancillary hereto shall be the Parent Termination Fee or the Parent Regulatory
Termination Fee (whichever is payable first), and following such payment no
Person shall have any rights or claims against Parent and its Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates and any Financing
Related Party under this Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and none of Parent and its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, directors and Affiliates and any Financing Related
Party shall have any further liability or obligation resulting from, arising
out of, or incurred in connection with, this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, only one of the Parent Termination Fee or the Parent Regulatory
Termination Fee shall be payable and such fee shall be payable only once and
not in duplication even though the Parent Termination Fee or the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee may be payable under one or more provisions
hereof.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and such termination
gives rise to the obligation of the Company to pay the Company Termination Fee
and the Company shall have paid the Company Termination Fee pursuant to

(including any Schedule hereto) may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_. (a)
The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either

deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
(i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties of such party that
is contained in this Agreement (regardless of the absence of an express

reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent.

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part
of any Specified Company SEC Document or Specified Parent SEC Document shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the
applicable partys representations and warranties if the relevance of that
information as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent; _provided_ that,
except for any specific factual information contained therein, in no event
shall any information contained in any part of any Specified Company SEC
Document or Specified Parent SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors" (or words of
similar import) or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking
Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
any representations and warranties of any party contained in this Agreement.

Section 11.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.07,

-104-  to clause (ii) above shall be enforceable on behalf of holders of Company
Stock only by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other
party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after
the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary and, _provided_ , _further_ , that either party
may assign its rights under this Agreement as collateral to any lender (or
agent or trustee therefor) in connection with any bona fide financing
arrangement permitted under this Agreement, including in the case of Parent,
the Financing.

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such state.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Company
(on behalf of itself and each Company Related Person) and each of the other
parties hereto agrees that any claim, controversy or dispute arising of any
kind or nature (including, without limitation, any claims sounding in contract
law, tort law or otherwise) against a Financing Related Party that is in any
way related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York without regard to conflict of law principles (other than Sections
5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) the interpretation of the definition of "Company
Material Adverse Effect" (and whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred) and (y) the determination of whether the transactions
contemplated hereby have been consummated in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall, in each case, be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such

 



-105-  party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. The parties hereto further agree that New York State or
United States federal courts sitting in the borough of Manhattan, City of New
York (and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over any action (whether at Law or at equity and whether brought
by any party hereto or any other Person) brought against any Financing
Related Party in connection with the Financing.

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR INVOLVING ANY FINANCING
RELATED PARTY.

Section 11.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication). Electronic or facsimile
signatures shall be deemed to be original signatures.

 

Section 11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the exhibits, schedules and annexes
hereto constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
their subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, between the parties with respect to that subject
matter.

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or contrary to
law, it is the parties intent that the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect, shall be enforced in full as reflecting the bargain of the parties and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court, without proof of actual damages (and each

 



-106-  party hereby waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond
in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

Section 11.14 _Guarantee_. From and after the First Company Merger
Effective Time, New Charter hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
the payment and performance of all of Parents obligations under this
Agreement.
