proves to be inaccurate; (ii) may have been qualified in the Stock Purchase
Agreement by disclosures that were made to the other party or parties in
connection with the negotiation of the Stock Purchase Agreement (provided that

2.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) Preparation of Proposed and Final Balance Sheets and Calculation
Statements. Within the later of (i) ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date or (ii) ten (10) Business Days following the final determination of Final
Net Operating Working Capital pursuant to the E-conolight Re-acquisition
Agreement, the Buyer shall prepare in accordance with GAAP, as consistently
applied by the Company and E-conolight LLC, respectively, and deliver to the
Seller Representative consolidated (but with respect to the Company, excluding
E-

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 16 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

conolight LLC) balance sheets of the Company and E-conolight LLC as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the "Proposed Balance Sheets" and, in their
final and binding form after resolution of any disputes pursuant to Section
2.4(b), the "Final Balance Sheets"). Accompanying the Proposed Balance Sheets,
the Buyer shall prepare and deliver a statement (the "Proposed Calculation
Statement" and, in its final and binding form after resolution of any disputes
pursuant to Section 2.4(b), the "Final Calculation Statement") setting forth
the Buyer's determination in accordance with this Agreement of the E-conolight
Re-acquisition Price, the Company Closing Working Capital, the E-conolight
Closing Working Capital, and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price
Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer's
determination of the Company Closing Working Capital and the E-conolight
Closing Working Capital shall be calculated on a basis and in a manner
consistent with the manner of preparation of the Audited Financial Statements
and the Estimated Working Capital Statement (except where the notes to the
Estimated Working Capital Statement require different treatment in the
determination of Company Closing Working Capital or E-conolight Closing
Working Capital, as applicable) and the determination of the Company Estimated
Working Capital and the E-conolight Estimated Working Capital and in
accordance with the accounting principles, methodologies, procedures and
assumptions set forth on and used in preparing the Audited Financial
Statements and the Estimated Working Capital Statement.

  

  

(b) Determination of the Final Balance Sheets and the Final Calculation
Statement.

  

  

(i) The Seller Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days (the
"Objection Period") after delivery of the Proposed Balance Sheets and the
Proposed Calculation Statement in which to provide written notice to the Buyer
of any objections thereto (an "Objection Notice"), setting forth in reasonable
detail the specific item to which each such objection relates and the specific
basis for each such objection. The Proposed Balance Sheets, the Proposed
Calculation Statement and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price
Adjustment shall be deemed to be accepted by the Seller Representative and
shall become final and binding on the parties, on the later of the expiration
of the Objection Period or the date on which all properly noticed objections
have been resolved by the Buyer and the Seller Representative or by the
Accounting Firm. If the Seller Representative gives any such Objection Notice
within the Objection Period, then the Seller Representative and the Buyer
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute concerning the item(s)
subject to such Objection Notice. If the Seller Representative and the Buyer
do not resolve any dispute within fifteen (15) days after the date of delivery
of the Objection Notice, which fifteen (15) day period may be extended by
written agreement of the Buyer and the Seller Representative (such period, as
it may be extended, the "Initial Resolution Period"), such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (ii) below.

  

  

(ii) If the Buyer and the Seller Representative have not been able to resolve
a dispute within the Initial Resolution Period, then either the Buyer or the
Seller Representative may submit such dispute to, and such dispute shall be
resolved fully, finally and exclusively by, the Accounting Firm. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in the resolution of such dispute
shall be borne by the Buyer and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Buyer and the Sellers from the resolution of the dispute,
which proportionate allocation

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 17 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of
the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits. For example, if the Seller
Representative challenges the calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment in
the Proposed Balance Sheets and in the Proposed Calculation Statement by an
amount of $100,000, but the Accounting Firm determines that the Seller
Representative has a valid claim for only $40,000 (i.e., the Seller
Representative prevails as to 40% of its claim), the Buyer shall bear 40% of
the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and the Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses. The
Buyer and the Seller Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accounting Firm to determine (and written notice thereof shall be
given to the Seller Representative and the Buyer) as promptly as practicable,
but in any event within thirty (30) days following the date on which the
Proposed Balance Sheets and the Proposed Calculation Statement are delivered
to the Accounting Firm, based on written submissions detailing the disputed
items and forwarded to it and such other evidence (including live testimony)
as the Accounting Firm requests or allows, only with respect to the disputed
items submitted to the Accounting Firm, whether and to what extent (if any)
the Proposed Balance Sheets, the Proposed Calculation Statement, the
adjustments and/or the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment
require adjustment in order to be in compliance with this Agreement and a
written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required adjustment,
including the basis therefor. All negotiations pursuant to this Section 2.4(b)
shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of
evidence, and all negotiations, submissions to the Accounting Firm, and
proceedings under this Section 2.4(b) shall be treated as confidential
information. The Accounting Firm shall be bound by a mutually agreeable
confidentiality agreement and in connection with the engagement of the
Accounting Firm the Buyer and the Seller Representative shall supply such
documents and information as the Accounting Firm shall reasonably request or
as such party reasonably deems appropriate. The procedures of this Section
2.4(b) are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The decision
rendered pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) may be filed as a judgment in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may seek specific enforcement or
take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision under this Section
2.4(b). The other party's only defense to such a request for specific
enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or upon the Accounting
Firm. Absent such fraud, such other party shall reimburse the party seeking
enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement.

  

  

(iii) Upon execution of such access letters as may be reasonably requested by
the Buyer, the Buyer will provide the Seller Representative reasonable access
during regular business hours to materials used in the preparation of the
Proposed Balance Sheets and the Proposed Calculation Statement and the
resulting calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment to be paid and by whom
pursuant to this Agreement, and shall make its (and the Company Group's)
financial staff and advisors reasonably available to the Seller Representative
and his accountants and other representatives during regular business hours to
assist in (A) the review by the Seller Representative of the Proposed Balance
Sheets, the Proposed Calculation Statement and the Purchase Price Adjustment
to be paid and by whom pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) the resolution by
the Buyer and the Seller Representative of any dispute or objection thereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 18 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment. Promptly after the Final
Balance Sheets and the Final Calculation Statement have been finally
determined, the following adjustments (collectively, the "Purchase Price
Adjustment") will be determined. The Purchase Price Adjustment initially will
be $0, subject to adjustment as follows:

  

  

(i) E-conolight Re-acquisition Price. The Purchase Price Adjustment shall be
increased or decreased by the amount by which the E-conolight Re-acquisition
Price is less than or greater than, respectively, the amount of the Estimated
E-conolight Re-acquisition Price.

  

  

(ii) Working Capital. The Purchase Price Adjustment shall be increased or
decreased by (A) the amount by which the Company Closing Working Capital is
greater than or less than the estimated Company Working Capital as of May 28,
2011, as set forth on the Estimated Working Capital Statement (the "Company
Estimated Working Capital"), and (B) the amount by which the E-conolight
Closing Working Capital is greater than or less than the estimated E-conolight
Working Capital as of May 28, 2011, as set forth on the Estimated Working
Capital Statement (the "E-conolight Estimated Working Capital").

  

  

(d) Determination of the Purchase Price. Promptly after the Purchase Price
Adjustment has become final and binding on the parties under this Section 2.4,
the Purchase Price shall be determined by giving effect to such final and
binding amounts, with appropriate payments made as follows:

  

  

(i) If the Purchase Price Adjustment is a positive number, then the Buyer
shall pay in cash the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment to the Sellers.
Payments to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) shall be by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the
Sellers in accordance with the allocations and wire instructions set forth on
Schedule 2.3(b) within five (5) Business Days after the Final Balance Sheets
and the Final Calculation Statement become final and binding.

  

  

(ii) If the Purchase Price Adjustment is a negative number, then the Buyer
shall be paid the absolute value of the Purchase Price Adjustment from the
Escrow Funds (using the same pro rata portion of cash and Buyer Common Stock
(based on the Reference Share Price) as comprised the Closing Consideration)
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The payment due to the
Buyer from the Escrow Funds pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Buyer and by distribution of the applicable number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock to the Buyer no later than five (5) Business Days after the Final
Balance Sheets and the Final Calculation Statement become final and binding.
For Tax purposes, any payment by the Buyer or the Sellers under this
Agreement, including pursuant to this Section 2.4 or Article VI, shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
Law.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but except as
provided in Section 6.4(i), the determination of the Final Balance Sheets, the
Final Calculation Statement and the resulting Purchase Price Adjustment shall
not preclude the Buyer from pursuing indemnification pursuant to Article VI.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 19 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.5 Escrow.

  

  

(a) As set forth in Section 2.3(b)(iv), at or prior to the Closing, the Buyer
shall deposit the Escrow Funds with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Funds shall
be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Funds shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
of and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Promptly following the first Business Day that is at least fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release Date"), but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days following such date, the remaining portion of
the Escrow Funds not then subject to retention pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be released from escrow, and thereafter as further amounts of
the Escrow Funds become no longer subject to retention pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, such amounts shall be released from escrow, in each case upon
demand by the Seller Representative made pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following amounts (collectively the
"Supplemental Escrow Retention") shall be retained in escrow after the Escrow
Release Date, in addition to any other portion of the Escrow Funds then
subject to retention pursuant to the Escrow Agreement: (i) if any litigation
set forth on Schedule 6.2(f) has not been completely resolved by the Escrow
Release Date, $9,305,885 and 151,871 shares of Buyer Common Stock
(collectively, the "Special Litigation Retention"), in respect of such
litigation, and (ii) 151,871 shares of Buyer Common Stock (the "Surviving
Representation Retention"), in respect of the Seller Surviving
Representations. If the amounts of cash and Buyer Common Stock then comprising
the Escrow Funds are insufficient to fully fund the Supplemental Escrow
Retention, then the remaining amounts of cash and Buyer Common Stock
comprising the Escrow Funds shall be retained, and if additional amounts
thereafter become no longer subject to retention under the Escrow Agreement,
such amounts shall be added to the amounts actually retained up to the full
amounts contemplated for the Supplemental Escrow Retention. Promptly following
the end of the survival period specified in Section 6.4(g), but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days following the end of such survival period,
any then-remaining portion of the Special Litigation Retention shall be
released from escrow, except to the extent that doing so would reduce the
remainder of the Supplemental Escrow Retention to an amount less than the
amount of the Surviving Representation Retention, net of any prior claims paid
therefrom. Promptly following the first Business Day that is at least thirty
(30) months after the Closing Date, but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days following such date, any then-remaining portion of the Surviving
Representation Retention not then subject to retention pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be released from escrow.

  

  

(c) For purposes of Section 2.5(b), and subject to the Escrow Agreement, (i)
any amounts released from escrow shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to
the Seller Representative for further distribution to the Sellers in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the allocations set forth on Schedule
2.3(b), (ii) the value of each share of Buyer Common Stock released from
escrow to any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to Article VI shall be deemed
to equal the Reference Share Price, (iii) except in the case of releases from
the Supplemental Escrow Retention in respect of Seller Surviving
Representations, any cash and Buyer Common Stock released from escrow shall,
to the extent possible, be released in the same proportions as the Closing
Consideration was comprised of cash and Buyer Common Stock,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 20 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

respectively, and (iv) in the case of releases from the Supplemental Escrow
Retention in respect of Seller Surviving Representations, only Buyer Common
Stock shall be released, not cash.

  

  

2.6 Seller Representative.

  

  

(a) The Sellers hereby appoint Christopher A. Ruud as their sole and exclusive
agent, representative and attorney-in-fact and authorize him to act for and on
behalf of each and all of the Sellers (with full power of substitution) with
respect to all matters arising in connection with the Escrow Agreement or any
amounts (including consideration and indemnification) payable in connection
with this Agreement (the above-named representative, or any subsequent
representative duly appointed, the "Seller Representative"), which shall
include the power to (i) make, execute, deliver and perform the Payoff Side
Letter and Escrow Agreement and such amendments of and supplements to the
Payoff Side Letter and Escrow Agreement or any other agreements, instruments
or documents relating to the Payoff Side Letter and Escrow Agreement that the
Seller Representative may consider necessary or appropriate and not materially
adverse to the Sellers' interests thereunder, such authority to be
conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof and (ii) receive
funds, make payments of funds, and give receipts for funds and to receive
funds for the payment of expenses of the Sellers and apply such funds in
payment for such expenses. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that such
appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. The Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on such appointment and treat the Seller Representative as
the duly appointed sole and exclusive attorney-in-fact of each Seller for all
such purposes. All actions, notices, communications and determinations by or
on behalf of the Sellers in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement shall be given or made by the Seller Representative, and all such
actions, notices, communications and determinations by the Seller
Representative shall be deemed conclusively to have been authorized by, and
shall be binding upon, each of the Sellers.

  

  

(b) Any payments by the Buyer under this Agreement into the account designated
by the Seller Representative shall constitute payment by the Buyer to each
Seller and satisfaction of the Buyer's obligation to pay such amount hereunder
and the Buyer shall have no further liability with respect thereto. After such
payment by the Buyer, the Seller Representative shall be solely responsible
for allocating and distributing to each Seller such Seller's share of the
Purchase Price from the Seller Representative's account and the Buyer will
have no further liability to the Sellers with respect to such payment.

  

  

(c) The Seller Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement and/or
payment from the Sellers (pro rata based upon their ownership of the Shares as
of immediately prior to the Closing) for any fees, expenses or costs he incurs
in exercising or performing his rights, duties and obligations under this
Agreement and the other documents and instruments executed and delivered
pursuant hereto by or on behalf of the Sellers. The Seller Representative, if
he determines in his good faith discretion, shall be entitled to withhold or
otherwise retain funds otherwise due the Sellers whether from the Escrow
Funds, to the extent the Sellers are entitled to amounts therein, or otherwise
in a separate account to cover any fees, expenses or costs he incurs in
exercising or performing his rights, duties and obligations under this
Agreement and the other documents and instruments executed and delivered
pursuant hereto by or on behalf of the Sellers.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 21 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any act
done or omitted hereunder as the Seller Representative while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith. Each Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify the Seller
Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Seller
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder.

  

  

(e) If Christopher A. Ruud resigns as the Seller Representative or becomes
legally incapacitated, then a successor Seller Representative may be appointed
by a majority in interest of the Sellers.

the Intellectual Property necessary for the Company Group to conduct its
business as currently conducted.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(b), neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Sellers
of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in (i) the breach of, loss
or diminution of rights in, or create on behalf of any third party the right
to create, terminate or modify, (A) any Company Intellectual Property or any
license, sublicense or other Contract relating to any Company Intellectual
Property or (B) any license, sublicense or other Contract to which a member of
the Company Group is a party and pursuant to which such Person is authorized
to use any Third Party Intellectual Property, excluding generally commercially
available, off-the-shelf software programs or (ii) any obligation for the

coexistence and consent agreements). No Contract relating to any Intellectual
Property to which the Company Group is a party or is bound is in breach or
default by the Company Group, nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any other party
thereto, and no event has occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both
would be reasonably likely to constitute such a breach or default thereunder
by the Company Group or, to the Company's Knowledge, any other party thereto,

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries
included or incorporated by reference in any Buyer SEC Reports (including the
related notes) complied as to form, as of the respective dates of filing of
such Buyer SEC Reports with the SEC (or, if amended, as of the date of such
amendment or, if superseded by a subsequent Buyer SEC Report filed prior to
the date hereof, as of the date of such subsequent Buyer Report), in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (including Regulation S-X), were
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X for Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial condition of Buyer and its
subsidiaries at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations
and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to notes and normal and recurring year-end adjustments that were
or will not be material in amount or effect). Ernst and Young LLP, which has
expressed its opinion with respect to the consolidated financial statements of
the Buyer and its subsidiaries included in the Buyer SEC Reports (including
the related notes) (x) is a registered public accounting firm (as defined in
Section 2(a)(12) of SOX), (y) is and has been throughout the periods covered
by such financial statements "independent" with respect to the Buyer within
the meaning of Regulation S-X, and (z) with respect to the Buyer, is in
compliance with subsections (g) through (l) of Section 10A of the Exchange
Act.

4.5 Investment Purpose; Accredited Investor Status. The Buyer is acquiring the
Shares for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view
to, or for sale in connection with, a distribution, as that term is used in
Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, in a manner which would require
registration under the Securities Act or any state securities Laws. The Buyer
can bear the economic risk of its investment in the Shares, has knowledge and
experience in financial business matters, is capable of bearing and managing
the risk of investment in the Shares and is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.

  

  

4.6 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Buyer SEC Reports, there is no
Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Buyer's Knowledge, threatened against or
affecting the Buyer, or any of its properties or rights, which, if adversely
determined, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Buyer

  

  

4.7 Brokers and Finders. No agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of
the Buyer is, or will be, entitled to any commission or broker's or finder's
fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.

  

  

4.8 No Additional Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the Buyer makes
no other express or implied representation or warranty, either written or
oral.

  

  

ARTICLE V.

  

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE BUYER AND THE SELLERS

  

  

5.1 Confidentiality; Public Announcements.

  

  

(a) Effective upon the Closing, the Buyer and the Sellers agree that the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of April 22, 2011, between the Buyer and
the Sellers shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.

  

  

(b) Each of the Sellers and the Seller Representative acknowledge and agree
that he, she or it and his, her or its Affiliates and Representatives have had
and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, will continue to have
following the Closing confidential and proprietary information related to the
Company Group and the Buyer. Each of the Sellers and the Seller Representative
agrees to hold, and to cause his, her or its Affiliates and Representatives to
hold, in strict confidence from any Person all information regarding the
Company Group or the Buyer that is not in (and does not become part of through
the fault of any Seller or any Affiliate or Representative of any Seller) the
public domain, except that the Sellers and the Seller Representative may
disclose such confidential information to their Representatives and Affiliates
who need to know such confidential information in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

  

  

(c) No Seller will, without the prior consent of the Buyer, make, directly or
indirectly, any public comment, statement or communication in respect of, or
otherwise disclose or permit any disclosure relating to, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 52 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.1 shall not prohibit any
such Person from making any disclosure which is (i) required to avoid a
violation of applicable Law by such Person or (ii) required by rule or
regulation of any securities exchange or market on which the securities of
such Person are listed or quoted, and in each such case the party required to
make such disclosure shall do so only to the limited extent necessary to
comply with such Law, regulation, rule or obligation and shall, to the extent
practicable, give advance notice thereof to the Buyer and an opportunity to
comment on any such disclosure and oppose the need therefor.

  

  

5.2 Cooperation. If at any time after the Closing, if any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
each party hereto shall take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other party
reasonably may request. Following the Closing, each party agrees to cooperate
with the other party or parties and to execute such further instruments,
documents and agreements, and to give such further written assurances, that
may be reasonably requested by any other party to evidence and reflect fully
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing
the Buyer will be entitled to sole possession of all documents, books, records
(including Tax records), agreements and financial data of any sort relating to
the Company Group; provided, however, the Buyer shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3 with the
Sellers by providing the Sellers such documents, books, records (including Tax
records), agreements and financial data to facilitate the Sellers' filing of
any required Tax Returns related to periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date.

  

  

5.3 Tax Matters. The provisions of this Section 5.3 shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other, for certain Tax matters.

  

  

(a) The Company and each Seller shall join with the Buyer in making an
election under Code §338(h)(10) (and any corresponding election under state,
local and non-U.S. Tax Law) with respect to the purchase and sale of Company
Stock hereunder (collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). The Sellers
shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or other Tax item resulting
from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on their Tax Returns to the extent
required by applicable Law. The Sellers shall also pay any Tax imposed on the
Company or its Subsidiaries attributable to the making of the Section
338(h)(10) Election, including (i) any Tax imposed under Code §1374, (ii) any
Tax imposed under Reg. §1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), or (iii) any state, local, or
non-U.S. Tax imposed on the Company's or its Subsidiaries' gain.

  

  

(b) The Buyer and the Sellers agree that the Purchase Price and the
liabilities of the Company, its qualified subchapter S subsidiaries, and its
disregarded entity Subsidiaries (plus other relevant items) will be allocated
to the assets of the Company, its qualified subchapter S subsidiaries and its
disregarded entity Subsidiaries for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with
the methodology and order set forth in Schedule 5.3(b). For Tax purposes, the
Purchase Price will be calculated as the sum of the Cash Consideration and the
fair market value of the Share Consideration determined as of the Closing
Date. The fair market value of the Share Consideration shall be determined as
the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 53 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

prices of shares of Buyer Common Stock on the Closing Date (without discount
or premium). The Buyer, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, and the
Sellers shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for
refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation
and will not take any position contrary thereto for Tax purposes. The Buyer
and the Sellers agree that no portion of the Purchase Price shall be allocated
to the Non-compete Agreements.

  

  

(c) The Seller Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including those which are
due to be filed after the Closing Date. The Seller Representative shall permit
the Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Buyer, provided such revisions do
not adversely affect the Sellers in any material respect. In order to permit
the Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return, the Seller
Representative shall deliver a copy of each such Tax Return to the Buyer no
later than thirty (30) days before the due date of such Tax Return. The Buyer
shall deliver any requested revisions to any such Tax Return to the Seller
Representative in writing no later than fifteen (15) days after Buyer's
receipt of such Tax Return from the Seller's Representative. The Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date; provided that any Tax Return with respect to any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period")
shall be prepared consistently in all material respects with prior practice
unless otherwise required by applicable Laws and shall be provided by the
Buyer to the Seller Representative for review and comment prior to the filing,
and the Buyer shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns with respect to a
Straddle Period as the Seller Representative may reasonably request, provided
such revisions do not adversely affect the Buyer, the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries in any material respect. In order to permit the Seller
Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return, the Buyer shall
deliver a copy of each such Tax Return to the Seller Representative no later
than thirty (30) days before the due date of such Tax Return. The Seller
Representative shall deliver any requested revisions to any such Tax Return to
the Buyer in writing no later than fifteen (15) days after the Seller
Representative's receipt of such Tax Return from the Buyer. To the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, the Sellers shall include any income, gain,
loss, deduction or other Tax items for such periods on their Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s furnished by the Company to the
Sellers for such periods. Nothing in this Section 5.3(c) shall limit Sellers'
or Buyer's indemnification obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Unless required by Law, neither the Buyer nor the Company (nor its
Subsidiaries) may amend or cause the amendment of a Tax Return of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, change an annual accounting period, adopt or
change any accounting method, or file or amend any Tax election concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date without the written consent of the Seller
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and the Buyer shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply), upon reasonable request by
the Seller Representative, cooperate in the preparation of and submission to
the proper Governmental or Regulatory Authority of any amended Tax Return with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period
ending on or before

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 54 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Closing Date; provided (i) the amended Tax Return shall comply with all
requirements of Law, (ii) the amendment of the Tax Return shall not adversely
affect the Buyer, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries in any
material respect, and (iii) any such amended Tax Return shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer. Nothing in this Section 5.3(d) shall limit Sellers'
indemnification obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Except to the extent treated as a current asset in the calculation of
Company Closing Working Capital or E-conolight Closing Working Capital, any
refund of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
interest with respect thereto) attributable (or treated as attributable) to
any period that occurs on or before the Closing Date (including the pre-
Closing portion of a Straddle Period) shall be the property of the Sellers,
and if received by the Buyer, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other
affiliated entity of the Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly pay such refund to
the Seller Representative; provided, however, if the refund is attributable to
a liability that should have been treated but was not treated as a current
liability in the calculation of Company Closing Working Capital or E-conolight
Closing Working Capital, the Buyer shall not be obligated to refund such Taxes
to the Sellers unless it first recovers the full amount of such liability
under Article VI.

  

  

(f) The Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) cooperate fully, as reasonably requested, in connection
with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 5.3
and any official inquiry, examination, audit or proceeding with respect to
Taxes; (ii) make available to the other, as reasonably requested, all
information, records or documents with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending prior to or including the
Closing Date; and (iii) preserve information, records or documents relating to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries that are in their
possession or under their control until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations or extensions thereof. The Buyer and the Sellers
further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

  

  

(g) The Sellers shall timely pay all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees arising from or relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Sellers shall, at their
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
and other Taxes and fees. If required by applicable Laws, the Buyer and the
Company will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation, subject to the Buyer's review.

  

  

5.4 Additional Financial Statements. At the Buyer's request and expense, the
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with the Buyer, and shall cause their
Affiliates to reasonably cooperate with the Buyer, so that the Buyer can
obtain, within the time periods required by the Exchange Act and/or the
Securities Act, any audited and unaudited financial statements and any pro
forma financial information relating to the Company Group that the Buyer is
required to file with the SEC, such financial statements and financial
information to be prepared in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X of the
SEC. The Sellers also hereby agree to consent to the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 55 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

inclusion of such financial statements and information obtained by the Buyer
pursuant to this Section 5.4, by or at the request of the Buyer, in any
filings by the Buyer with the SEC or any other securities regulatory authority
or exchange. The Sellers further agree that each of them will use, as
applicable, commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Group's
auditors, at the Buyer's expense, to provide to the Buyer (or the Buyer's
successor) such auditor's consent to the inclusion of any such financial
statements or the information contained therein, in any filings by or on
behalf of the Buyer (or the Buyer's successor) with the SEC or any other
securities regulatory authority or exchange.

  

  

5.5 Release by the Sellers. Each Seller, for such Seller and such Seller's
successors and assigns, does hereby irrevocably and unconditionally release,
remise, acquit and forever discharge the Company and the Buyer, and their
Affiliates, Representatives, lenders, successors and assigns, of and from all
and any manner of claims, actions, rights, causes of action, suits,
obligations, liabilities, debts, due sums of money, agreements, promises,
damages, judgments, executions, accounts, expenses, costs, attorneys' fees and
demands whatsoever, except as provided in this Agreement, whether in law or
equity, whether known or unknown, matured or unmatured, foreseen or
unforeseen, arising out of events existing or occurring contemporaneously with
or prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall operate to release any obligations of the Company or the Buyer, and
their Affiliates, Representatives, lenders, successors and assigns, to any
Seller or such Seller's successors and assigns: (a) arising under or pursuant
to this Agreement and the Transaction Documents executed in connection
therewith, including any Seller's right to be paid the Purchase Price or any
rights to indemnification arising under this Agreement; or (b) in the event
that such person is now, or was at any time in the past, an officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any statutory right or
rights created by the Company's or its Subsidiary's Organizational Documents
to indemnification now existing in favor of such Seller or such Seller's
successors and assigns with respect to such person's activities as an officer
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, but with respect to
this subsection (b) only to the extent the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
Representatives, lenders, successors and assigns is not entitled to
indemnification in connection with such matter under the terms of this
Agreement.

  

  

5.6 Assignment of Intellectual Property. Each Seller hereby agrees to assign
and hereby does assign to the Company any and all right, title and interest of
such Seller in all Intellectual Property which has been made, conceived,
written, designed or developed by such Seller to the date of this Agreement
utilizing the Company Group's facilities, materials, employees and/or
confidential and/or proprietary information or in the course of the
performance of employment, consulting or other services to the Company Group,
solely or jointly with others, and whether during normal business hours or
otherwise (the "Seller Inventions") and any and all related industrial and
Intellectual Property rights and applications therefor, in the United States
and elsewhere, and appoints any officer of the Company as such Seller's duly
authorized attorney to execute, file, prosecute and protect the same before
any Governmental Body, which appointment is coupled with an interest by virtue
of this Agreement and is irrevocable. Upon the reasonable request of the
Company or the Buyer, each Seller shall execute such further assignments,
documents and other instruments as may be necessary or reasonably desirable to
assign all Seller Inventions fully and completely to the Company and to
reasonably assist the Company in applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents
or copyrights or other rights in the United States and in any foreign country
with respect to any Seller Invention.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 56 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.7 Transfer Restrictions.

  

  

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that the Buyer Common Stock to be issued as Share
Consideration will not be registered under the Securities Act or the
securities Laws of any other jurisdiction, and that the offer and sale of the
Share Consideration is being made in reliance on one or more exemptions for
private offerings under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and other
applicable securities Laws. Accordingly, no sale, transfer or other
disposition (whether with or without consideration and whether voluntarily or
involuntarily or by operation of Law) ("Transfer") of any of the Buyer Common
Stock to be issued as Share Consideration is permitted, unless such Transfer
is registered under the Securities Act and other applicable securities Laws,
or an exemption from such registration is available or such registration is
otherwise not required. Each Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the
Buyer Common Stock issued as Share Consideration constitutes "restricted
securities" as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and
that the Buyer is under no obligation to register any of such shares pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. To facilitate sales of Share
Consideration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Buyer agrees
that it shall (i) timely file all reports required to be filed by it under
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (to the extent necessary to comply
with Rule 144(c)(1)) for a period of one year following the Closing Date and
(ii) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to enable any of the
holders of the Share Consideration (including any Charitable Transferee that
receives a Transfer of any of the Share Consideration in accordance with
Section 5.7(b) below) to sell the Share Consideration pursuant to Rule 144
under the Securities Act. For purposes of Rule 144(d), the Buyer and each
Seller intend for the holding period of all of the Share Consideration
(including any Share Consideration included in the Escrow Funds), to the
extent permitted by applicable Law (including applicable interpretations by
the SEC), to commence on the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Each Seller further acknowledges and agrees that, in order to align each
Seller's interest with the interests of the ongoing business of the Buyer
following the Closing, in addition to the restrictions set forth in Section
5.7(a) above, for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date,
subject to lapse as provided in the next sentence, the Share Consideration may
not be sold, pledged, assigned, transferred, conveyed, hypothecated or
otherwise transferred or disposed of (which shall include the creation of any
Encumbrance on such shares, or transfer of any legal, beneficial or economic
interest in such shares, whether or not for value), including any short sale,
purchase of publicly traded options with respect to such shares or the entry
into hedging or monetization transactions with respect to such shares (the
"Transfer Restrictions"). The Transfer Restrictions will lapse with respect to
25% of each Seller's Share Consideration at the completion of the six (6)
consecutive month period commencing on the Closing Date and at the completion
of each of the following three successive six-month periods; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the lapsing schedule and without increasing or
decreasing the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as to which the Transfer
Restrictions lapse at each release date, each Seller may Transfer up to an
aggregate (including both (i) and (ii) below) of thirty percent (30%) of his,
her or its Share Consideration (i) to bona fide charitable, religious,
educational or similar nonprofit institutions (each a "Charitable Transferee")
prior to the initial Transfer Restriction expiration date or (ii) in hedging
transactions made on or before April 13, 2012, so long as (x) the Transfers
are not for the purpose, and do not have the effect, of circumventing the
Transfer Restrictions (it being acknowledged and agreed that hedging
transactions in compliance with clause (ii) of this sentence shall not be
deemed to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 57 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

be for such purpose or to have such effect) and (y) each such Charitable
Transferee agrees to be bound by the Transfer Restrictions and to not Transfer
the Share Consideration until the completion of the six (6) month period
commencing on the Closing Date; further provided that, in all events, any
Transfer by any Seller or any transferee thereof must be in accordance with
the requirements of (1) all applicable Laws (including the Securities Act and
the securities Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction), (2) Section 5.7(a),
and (3) any applicable policies (including insider trading and hedging
policies) of the Buyer as may be in effect from time to time on or after the
Closing Date. The Buyer agrees that no portion of the Share Consideration
delivered to the Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow Funds shall have its
Transfer Restrictions lapse while held in escrow and that the Share
Consideration delivered to the Sellers at Closing and not placed in escrow
shall have priority with respect to the lapse of the Transfer Restrictions.

  

  

(c) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the book-entry notation
representing the Share Consideration shall contain legends substantially in
the form of the following, as well as any additional legends that may be
required by applicable Law or as the Buyer may reasonably deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time for all shares of Buyer Common Stock then
outstanding (and a stop transfer order may be placed against the transfer of
the Share Consideration); provided however, that only the Buyer Common Stock
subject to the Escrow Agreement shall bear the first legend identified below:

  

  

THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO AN ESCROW AGREEMENT WITH THE ISSUER AND THE
ESCROW AGENT NAMED THEREIN (THE "ESCROW AGREEMENT"), A COPY OF WHICH IS ON
FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF THE ISSUER AND WHICH, AMONG OTHER MATTERS,
PLACES RESTRICTIONS ON THE DISPOSITION OF THE SECURITIES. THESE SECURITIES
WILL BE DEPOSITED WITH THE ESCROW AGENT PURSUANT TO THE ESCROW AGREEMENT AND
MAY NOT BE OFFERED, EXCHANGED, TRANSFERRED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED,
PARTICIPATED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF FOR SO LONG AS THEY ARE
SUBJECT TO THE ESCROW AGREEMENT.

  

  

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD UNLESS THEY
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE (AND, IN SUCH CASE, AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER SHALL HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO THE ISSUER TO THE
EFFECT THAT SUCH OFFER OR SALE IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT).

  

  

THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE STOCK
PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED AUGUST 17, 2011, BY AND AMONG THE ISSUER AND CERTAIN
OTHER PERSONS, WHICH RESTRICT THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE
OF THESE SECURITIES. A COPY OF SUCH STOCK PURCHASE

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 58 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW BY THE RECORD HOLDER OF THESE SECURITIES AT
THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF THE ISSUER.

  

  

The Buyer shall remove the first legend identified above from the book-entry
notation representing any of the Share Consideration (and terminate any
related stop-transfer order) upon release of the applicable portion of the
Share Consideration from escrow. The Buyer, upon the request of any holder of
any of the Share Consideration, shall remove the second legend identified
above from the book-entry notation representing any of the Share Consideration
(and terminate any related stop-transfer order) if (i) such holder provides
the Buyer reasonable assurances that such Share Consideration is eligible for
sale, assignment or transfer under Rule 144, including proper documentation in
the form of a customary representation letter reasonably sufficient to
establish compliance with Rule 144, and (ii) if reasonably requested by the
Buyer (provided that any such request shall be deemed to be reasonable if the
Buyer's transfer agent requests such an opinion), the Buyer has received a
written opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer that such
second legend may be removed from the book-entry notation representing such
Share Consideration. The Buyer shall remove the third legend identified above
from the book-entry notation representing any part of the Share Consideration
(and terminate any related stop-transfer orders) immediately upon the lapse of
the Transfer Restrictions with respect to such part of the Share
Consideration.

  

  

5.8 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) The Buyer intends to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to
employ immediately after the Closing substantially all of the employees of the
Company Group who were employed by the Company Group immediately prior to the
Closing on such continued terms of employment (including compensation and
benefits) as are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in place
immediately after Closing. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
terms of such Plans, the Buyer shall cause any individual employed by the
Company Group at the Closing (a "Company Employee") to receive credit for
service accrued prior to the Closing Date with the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting under any defined contribution Plan established or maintained by the
Buyer or any Affiliate thereof under which each Company Employee may be
eligible to participate on or after the Closing, to the same extent such
service was recognized under comparable Plans, programs or arrangements of the
Company Group immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding
of any such benefit.

  

  

(b) With respect to the welfare plans, programs and arrangements maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by the Buyer or its Affiliates (the "Buyer Welfare
Plans") in which a Company Employee may be eligible to participate on or after
the Closing, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to waive,
or cause its insurance carrier to waive, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions (if any) with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Company Employees under the Buyer Welfare Plans
(other than any life insurance arrangement or long-term disability insurance
arrangement that is not fully paid for by the Buyer and its Affiliates) to the
same extent such limitations are waived under the comparable Company Plan, if
any, and (ii) credit, or cause its insurance carrier to credit under the
applicable Buyer Welfare Plans for the plan year that includes the Closing
Date,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 59 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Company Employees who were enrolled immediately prior to the Closing Date in
the comparable Company Plans, with the deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket expenses with which these Company Employees had been credited under
such Plans for that plan year.

  

  

(c) From and after the Closing, except as specified herein or as otherwise
agreed in writing between the Buyer and the Company Employee, the Buyer will
cause the Company Group to honor, in accordance with its terms (including any
rights of amendment, modification or termination provided therein), (i) the
obligations in effect as of the Closing under any bonus and vacation plans,
programs or agreements of the Company Group set forth on Schedule 3.17(a)
(except to the extent such plan is terminated or required to be terminated
hereunder), but only to the extent the amounts accrued thereunder are treated
as a current liability in the calculation of the Company Closing Working
Capital or the E-conolight Closing Working Capital and (ii) the obligations to
provide benefits accrued as of the Closing Date under each Company Plan, even
if the Buyer thereafter makes any modifications or amendments to any Company
Plan.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall (i)
obligate the Buyer to cause the Company Group to continue the employment or
benefits of any specific employee after the Closing Date or (ii) limit the
right of the Buyer or its Affiliates, at any time and from time to time, to
amend, modify or terminate, in whole or in part, any of the Company Plans of
the Company Group, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by
Law, and the Buyer hereby reserves such right.

  

  

5.9 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Company Group
shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company Group to, to the fullest extent
provided by the Company Group's Organizational Documents as in effect
immediately prior to Closing or, to the extent more favorable and not
inconsistent with such Organizational Documents, applicable Law as in effect
immediately prior to Closing, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
expenses, provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides a
reasonable and customary undertaking (which shall not include posting of any
collateral) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification) the present and former directors
and officers of any member of the Company Group or any fiduciaries under all
Company Plans (each a "Company Indemnified Party") against any and all costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
regulatory or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with
any circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Closing, including the
approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or arising
out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this Section 5.9(a) shall provide any rights to any
Person for any acts or omissions by such Person occurring or alleged to occur
in such Person's capacity as a Seller. The indemnity provided for in this
Section 5.9(a) is not intended and shall not be deemed to limit, condition,
reduce or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 60 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

supplant the primary availability of any insurance that would be available in
the absence of such indemnity.

  

  

(b) The Company Group shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company Group to,
at no expense to the beneficiaries, either (i) continue to maintain in effect
for six (6) years from the Closing directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance having terms and conditions at
least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as the Company Group's
currently existing directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (the "Current Insurance") with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing (including the transactions
contemplated hereby), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting
period endorsement under the Current Insurance (a "Reporting Tail
Endorsement") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing (including the transactions contemplated hereby) and maintain this
endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Buyer or the Company Group be required to
expend for any such policy an annual premium amount in excess of 100% of the
annual premium paid by the Company Group for such Current Insurance policy if
purchasing the coverage pursuant to subsection (i), nor a total premium amount
in excess of 150% of the annual premiums paid by the Company Group for such
Current Insurance policy if purchasing the coverage pursuant to subsection
(ii); provided further that if the premium for either insurance policy exceeds
the applicable amount, the Buyer or the Company Group shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 5.9(b), if the Company
Group has obtained a Reporting Tail Endorsement prior to the Closing, (a) the
Company Group shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Company Group to, maintain
in full force and effect for its full term such policy and (b) neither the
Buyer nor (following Closing) the Company Group shall have any other
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.9(b).

  

  

(c) If the Company Group or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, the Buyer shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company Group shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

  

  

(d) This Section 5.9 is intended for the benefit of, and to grant third-party
rights to, the Company Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Buyer and the Company Group. Each Company
Indemnified Party shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.9, and
entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.9. The rights of
the Company Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to
any rights such Company Indemnified Parties may have under the Organizational
Documents of the Company Group or under any applicable Contracts, insurance
policies or Laws.

ARTICLE VI.

  

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNITY

  

  

6.1 Survival. All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in
this Agreement (including the Schedules hereto) and any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to Section 6.6. The right to
indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations will not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) about, the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any
such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

  

  

6.2 Indemnification and Reimbursement of Buyer Indemnified Persons. Subject to
the limitations contained in this Article VI, the Sellers shall, to the extent
provided herein, jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Company Group) and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Persons") against, and
shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for, any loss, liability, claim,
damage, expense (including costs of investigation and defense and reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim,
but excluding any consequential, indirect, special and punitive damages
(except in each case to the extent included in a Third-Party Claim or arising
from an action or claim based upon fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct (including any willful breach of this Agreement))
(collectively, "Damages"), arising, directly or indirectly, from or in
connection with:

  

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or the
Sellers in this Agreement (including the Schedules hereto) and any certificate
delivered prior to or at Closing by the Company or the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Seller Representative or
any of the Sellers contained in this Agreement;

  

  

(c) except to the extent paid prior to Closing or treated as a current
liability in the calculation of Company Closing Working Capital or E-conolight
Closing Working Capital, (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Tax Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member
on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations
§1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign Law, and (iii)
any and all Taxes of any other Person imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by Contract or pursuant to any Law,
to the extent such Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring on or
before the Closing Date (collectively, "Pre-Closing Taxes"); and for purposes
of the foregoing, in the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes
based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 62 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

which Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period;

  

  

(d) any brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments based
upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any Person
with the Company Group or any of the Sellers (or any Person acting on their
behalf) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;

  

  

(e) except to the extent treated as a current liability in the calculation of
Company Closing Working Capital, any Transaction Expenses of the Company Group
not paid prior to Closing; and

  

  

(f) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.4(g) below, the matters
that are the subject of the litigation set forth on Schedule 6.2(f), including
any subsequent appeals or other proceedings, to the extent such Damages are
not paid or reimbursed by existing insurance coverage of the Company, and net
of any amounts recovered by the Company under claims asserted by the Company
in such litigation based on the business conducted by or rights of the Company
Group in effect prior to the Closing.

  

  

6.3 Indemnification and Reimbursement of Seller Indemnified Persons. Subject
to the limitations contained in this Article VI, the Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons") against, and
shall reimburse the Seller Indemnified Persons for, any Damages arising,
directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:

  

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyer in this
Agreement (including the Schedules hereto) and any certificate delivered prior
to or at Closing by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Buyer contained in this
Agreement; and

  

  

(c) any brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar payments based
upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by any Person
with the Buyer (or any Person acting on its behalf) in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

6.4 Limitations on Indemnification of Buyer Indemnified Persons.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the right of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons to be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed
pursuant to Section 6.2 is subject to the following limitations and
qualifications:

  

  

(a) A Buyer Indemnified Person shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 6.2(a) for breaches of representations and/or warranties (other than
the representations and warranties contained in the first sentence of Section
3.10) for any individual item, or group

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 63 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

or series of related items, where the Damages related thereto for which the
Buyer Indemnified Person would otherwise be entitled to indemnification are
less than $100,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"); provided, however, that if the
Damages related thereto for which the Buyer Indemnified Person would otherwise
be entitled to indemnification equal or exceed the De Minimis Amount, then the
Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification in full for all
breaches of such representations and/or warranties without regard to the De
Minimis Amount (but subject to the other limitations set forth in this Section
6.4 or in Section 6.6).

  


 

  

(b) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any amounts
under Section 6.2(a) until the total amount of Damages incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Persons under Section 6.2(a) exceeds $3,102,000 (the "Basket"), in
which case the Buyer Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover the full
amount of Damages from the first dollar.

  

  

(c) The limitations set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 6.4 shall
not apply to breaches of Sections 3.1 (Ownership of Stock), 3.2(a) and (b),
but only with respect to the Company (Organization, Qualification and Power;
Subsidiaries), 3.3 (Capitalization), 3.4(a) and 3.4(b)(i) - (iii) (Authority;
No Conflict), and 3.22 (Taxes) (the "Seller Core Representations").

  

  

(d) The Escrow Funds shall be the maximum amount of, and the Buyer Indemnified
Persons' sole and exclusive source of satisfaction for, Damages arising under
Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(f), except for Damages arising with respect to any
claim for a breach of any of (i) Sections 3.12 (Compliance with Applicable
Laws; Permits), 3.15 (Environmental Matters), or 3.17 (Employee Benefits) (the
"Seller Surviving Representations") or (ii) the Seller Core Representations.

  

  

(e) The maximum amount of the Supplemental Escrow Retention available to the
Buyer Indemnified Persons (x) in respect of Damages arising under Section
6.2(a) in respect of Seller Surviving Representations shall be the amount of
the Surviving Representation Retention, and (y) in respect of Damages arising
under Section 6.2(f) shall be the amount of the Special Litigation Retention.

  

  

(f) With respect to any claim for a breach of any Seller Surviving
Representation or any Seller Core Representation or any claim for
indemnification or reimbursement to the extent not arising under Section
6.2(a) or 6.2(f), the Escrow Funds shall be the Buyer Indemnified Persons'
first and primary source of satisfaction for such Damages; provided, however,
that to the extent no Escrow Funds are available pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Persons may seek recourse directly from each
and any Seller for the remaining amount of the applicable Damages, in which
case each Seller shall be liable only for his, her or its pro rata portion of
such Damages based upon the allocations set forth on Schedule 2.3(b)
(provided, however, that any individual Seller who is a settlor or beneficiary
of a Seller that is a trust shall be jointly and severally liable for such
trust Seller's pro rata share of such Damages), and capped as follows: (i)
Damages for the breach of a Seller Surviving Representation shall be capped at
the lesser of (A) such Seller's pro rata portion of $9,305,885 or (B) the
value of the Closing Cash Consideration ultimately distributed from escrow to
such Seller other than from the Supplemental Escrow Retention, provided that
such Damages shall be

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 64 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

paid to the Buyer Indemnified Persons solely in cash; and (ii) Damages for
breaches of any Seller Core Representation or any claim for indemnification or
reimbursement to the extent not arising under Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(f) shall
be capped at the amount of the Purchase Price actually paid to such Seller.

  

  

(g) The indemnification rights available to the Buyer Indemnified Persons
under Section 6.2(f) shall survive as follows: (1) if the litigation is
completely resolved within thirty (30) months following Closing, until thirty
(30) days following the date of such resolution (subject to the Sellers'
obligation to pay, if applicable, the first "royalty year" as contemplated
below in this subsection (g)); or (2) if the litigation is not completely
resolved within thirty (30) months following Closing, until the first Business
Day that is at least thirty (30) months following Closing. The Damages
indemnifiable under Section 6.2(f) shall be limited to the Escrow Funds as
provided in Section 6.4(d) and shall (i) not include any internal costs
associated with the investigation and defense of the litigation by the Buyer's
or its Affiliates' personnel and (ii) be limited in the case of any Damages
incurred after Closing in respect of action taken in defense, settlement or
other resolution of such litigation after Closing to fifty percent (50%) of
the Damages incurred (on a dollar-for-dollar basis), except that to the extent
any such Damages include the payment of an ongoing royalty on terms that do
not differ between the first year and subsequent years, Damages for the
royalty will be limited to 100% of such royalty for the first year following
the resolution of the matter and none of the royalty thereafter. The Buyer
shall be entitled to control such litigation from and after the Closing;
provided, however, it shall (x) keep the Seller Representative reasonably
informed as to the status of the litigation, (y) allow the Seller
Representative to provide input and comment on the litigation strategy and
resolution thereof and (z) not compromise or settle such litigation without
the Seller Representative's consent; provided, however, that the Seller
Representative's consent to any such compromise or settlement shall not be
required if (A) the aggregate indemnification obligation under Section 6.2(f)
with respect to such compromise or settlement does not exceed 2.5% of the
value of the Closing Consideration (with the Closing Share Consideration being
valued at the Reference Share Price) and (B) the terms of such compromise or
settlement include a full release of all claims in the litigation against each
Shareholder named as an individual defendant therein.

  

  

(h) Nothing contained herein (including clauses (a) through (g) of this
Section 6.4) shall limit or restrict any Buyer Indemnified Person's right to
maintain or recover any amounts in connection with any action or claim based
upon fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct (including any
willful breach of this Agreement).

  

  

(i) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement to the extent the Damages of the Buyer Indemnified Person
are reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment. With
respect to a claim for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnified Person related
to the litigation described on Schedule 6.2(f), such Buyer Indemnified
Persons' sole recourse shall be pursuant to Section 6.2(f) and such Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to bring a claim for a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.14 with respect to any
matters indemnifiable under Section 6.2(f).

  

  

(j) The Buyer Indemnified Persons are authorized to recover from the Escrow
Funds the entire amount of, or any portion of, any claim for Damages without
regard to the amounts contributed or deemed to be contributed by the Sellers
to the Escrow Funds. The

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 65 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Sellers will settle among themselves any right to contribution or indemnity
with regard to amounts paid from the Escrow Funds.

  

  

(k) If the litigation set forth on Schedule 6.2(f) is completely resolved
within thirty (30) months following Closing and the Company recovers any
amounts under claims asserted by the Company under such litigation based on
the business conducted by or rights of the Company Group in effect prior to
the Closing, then the Sellers shall be entitled to fifty percent (50%) of the
excess of such amounts over the Damages of the Buyer and its Affiliates
arising in connection with such litigation that are not paid or reimbursed by
existing insurance coverage of the Company, provided that to the extent any
such excess recoveries include the payment of an ongoing royalty on terms that
do not differ between the first year and subsequent years, the Sellers shall
be entitled to 100% of such excess royalty for the first year following the
resolution of the matter and none of the royalty thereafter; and provided
further that the maximum amount payable to the Sellers under this Section
6.4(k) shall be an amount equal to 2.5% of the value of the Closing
Consideration (with the Closing Share Consideration being valued at the
Reference Share Price). If applicable, the Buyer shall pay the portion of such
amounts due the Sellers under this Section 6.4(k) to the Seller Representative
within thirty (30) days following the date of the resolution of such
litigation.

  

  

6.5 Limitations on Indemnification of Seller Indemnified Persons.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the right of the
Seller Indemnified Persons to be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed
pursuant to Section 6.3 is subject to the following limitations and
qualifications:

  

  

(a) The Seller Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any amounts
under Section 6.3(a) until the total amount of Damages incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Persons under Section 6.3(a) exceeds the Basket, in which case the
Seller Indemnified Persons will be entitled to recover the full amount of
Damages from the first dollar.

  

  

(b) The maximum amount of Damages that may be recovered by the Seller
Indemnified Persons under Section 6.3(a) shall be $62,039,000.

  

  

(c) The limitations set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 6.5 shall
not apply to breaches of Section 4.1 (Organization, Qualification and Power),
4.2 (Buyer Common Stock) and 4.3(a) (Authority; No Conflict) (the "Buyer Core
Representations").

  

  

(d) Nothing contained herein (including Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(b))
shall limit or restrict any Seller Indemnified Person's right to maintain or
recover any amounts in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct (including any willful
breach of this Agreement).

  

  

6.6 Time Limitations.

  

  

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any amounts
under Section 6.2(a), unless on or before the first Business Day that is at
least fifteen (15) months) after the Closing Date the Buyer notifies the
Seller Representative of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in
reasonable detail to the extent then Known by the Buyer; provided, however,
that (i) any claim with respect to a breach of a Seller Surviving

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 66 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Representation may be made by the Buyer on or before the first Business Day
that is at least thirty (30) months after the Closing Date and (ii) any claim
with respect to a breach of a Seller Core Representation or any claim for
indemnification or reimbursement to the extent not arising under Section
6.2(a) or 6.2(f) (which time limitations are set forth in Section 6.4(g)) may
be made by the Buyer at any time prior to thirty (30) days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period.

  

  

(b) The Seller Indemnified Persons shall have no right to recover any amounts
under Section 6.3(a), unless on or before the first Business Day that is at
least fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date the Seller Representative
notifies the Buyer of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in
reasonable detail to the extent then Known by the Seller Representative;
provided, however, that any claim with respect to any Buyer Core
Representation or any claim for indemnification or reimbursement not arising
under Section 6.3(a) may be made by the Seller Representative at any time
prior to thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations period.

  

  

(c) For purposes of Sections 6.6(a) and (b) above, claims made in good faith
in writing and setting forth in reasonable detail the claim prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period, including claims made with
respect to actions anticipated in good faith, regardless of whether any action
or demand has in fact been commenced, shall be deemed to have been brought
prior to the end of the applicable survival period (it being understood that
any and all Damages arising after the expiration of the applicable survival
period shall be recoverable upon notice properly given prior to the expiration
of the applicable survival period in accordance with this Article VI).

  

  

6.7 Third-Party Claims.

  

  

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section 6.2
or 6.3 (an "Indemnified Person," and any Person required to provide indemnity
under this Agreement, an "Indemnifying Person") of notice of the assertion of
any claim against any Indemnified Person by a third party (a "Third-Party
Claim"), and in any event within thirty (30) days of such receipt, such
Indemnified Person shall give notice (i) with respect to any claims under
Section 6.2, to the Seller Representative, and (ii) with respect to any claims
under Section 6.3, to the Buyer, of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim,
provided that the failure to timely provide such notice will not relieve any
Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified
Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that
the defense of such Third-Party Claim is prejudiced by the Indemnified
Person's failure to give such notice. Any claim by any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority for Tax(es) which is subject to indemnity under this
Agreement shall be understood to be a Third-Party Claim.

  

  

(b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice pursuant to Section 6.7(a) of the
assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that
it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom
the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the
Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified
Person of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide
indemnification with respect to such Third-Party

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 67 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying
Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently
conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article
VI for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim,
other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Person
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will
conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in
that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification,
(ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by
the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Person's Consent unless (A)
there is no finding or admission that the Indemnified Person violated any Law
or any rights of any Person; and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (iii) the
Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its Consent. If notice
is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim
and the Indemnifying Person does not, within twenty (20) days after the
Indemnified Person's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of
its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Person will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or
any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates in any material respect other than as a
result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the
Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or
settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound
by any compromise or settlement effected without its Consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

(d) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this Article VI, (i) each of the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other fully informed in all
material respects of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related
proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its
own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in
good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any Third-Party Claim.

  

  

6.8 Procedure For Indemnification - Other Claims. A claim for indemnification
for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by (a) in the
case of any claim by the Buyer Indemnified Persons under Section 6.2, written
notice by the Buyer to the Seller Representative, and (b) in the case of any
claim by the Seller Indemnified Persons under Section 6.3, written notice by
the Seller Representative to the Buyer.

  

  

6.9 Exclusive Remedy. Except for a claim for Damages described in Section
6.4(h) or Section 6.5(d), the indemnification provided for in this Article VI
shall be the exclusive

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 68 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

remedy available to an Indemnified Person in connection with any breach of
this Agreement and/or any Damages arising out of the matters set forth in this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder; provided, however, that
nothing herein will limit any Indemnified Person's rights hereunder or
otherwise to injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; and provided further that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
limit or restrict any Person who is a party to any other Transaction Document
that is a Contract to obtain Damages or any other legal or equitable relief
from any other Person who is a party to any such agreement in connection with
the breach of such agreement by such other Person pursuant to the terms
thereof.

  

  

6.10 No Double Materiality. For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages
to which the Buyer Indemnified Persons and Seller Indemnified Persons are
entitled under this Article VI (but not for purposes of determining whether a
representation or warranty has been breached), the terms "material,"
"materiality," and "material adverse effect" will be disregarded.

  

  

6.11 Insurance. The amount of any indemnity paid under this Article VI shall
be limited to the amount of any Damages that remains after deducting therefrom
any insurance proceeds actually received by an Indemnified Person in
connection with or as a result of any claim giving rise to indemnification
hereunder, it being agreed that such Indemnified Person shall consider in good
faith the potential availability of insurance coverage for all or part of such
Damages under then-current policies (but without any obligation to seek to
recover any such insurance proceeds) in connection with making a claim under
this Article VI. If an Indemnified Person subsequently receives such insurance
proceeds, then the Indemnified Person shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying
Person the amount of insurance proceeds subsequently received (net of all
related costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any
related insurance claims and any related increases in insurance premiums or
other chargebacks), but not more, in the aggregate, than the indemnity amount
paid by the Indemnifying Person. No Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to
be subrogated to any rights of an Indemnified Person, except that if and to
the extent an Indemnifying Person indemnifies an Indemnified Person for
Damages pursuant to this Article VI, such Indemnifying Person shall be
subrogated to any rights such Indemnified Person may then have against any
insurer with respect thereto (and, upon the reasonable request of the
Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person shall take appropriate actions
necessary to transfer and assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Person).
The indemnification provided for in this Article VI is not intended and shall
not be deemed to limit, condition, reduce or supplant the primary availability
of any insurance that would be available in the absence of such
indemnification.

  

  

6.12 Value of Buyer Common Stock. For all purposes of this Article VI, the per
share value of the Buyer Common Stock shall be deemed to equal the Reference
Share Price.

  

  

6.13 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any payments made pursuant to the
indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

7.2 Other Remedies. Except as specifically provided in Section 5.3 and Article
VI, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict in any manner any other

remedy to which any party may be entitled at law or in equity, any party shall
be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.

enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement
shall be brought against any of the parties in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, and each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of
such court (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or
proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any
action or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on
any party anywhere in the world.

  

  

7.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE SELLERS AND THE SELLER

7.8 Successors; Assigns. This Agreement may not be transferred, assigned,
pledged or hypothecated by any party hereto without the other parties' prior
written consent, except that the Buyer may assign without consent its rights
and obligations hereunder to any Person that succeeds to all or substantially
all of the Buyer's business. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall

7.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other documents
referred to herein, contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein. This
Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to such subject matter. All Schedules to this Agreement
are intended to be and hereby are specifically made a part of this Agreement.

  

  

7.11 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be amended,
modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each party
hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so
waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

  

  

7.12 Severability. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

7.13 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as explicitly provided herein, each
party hereto intends that this Agreement shall not benefit or create any right
or cause of action in or on behalf of any Person or entity other than the
parties hereto.

contained in the Sellers' Disclosure Schedule, and references to all other
Schedules refer to the Schedules that are attached hereto and made a part of
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms, lists of schedules and headings contained in this Agreement are

by the words "without limitation." The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. No summary of this Agreement prepared by
any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
