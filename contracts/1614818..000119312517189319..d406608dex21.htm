(c) _Treatment of Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock,

the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, shall not have effectively withdrawn
or lost such Persons rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL with
respect to such shares (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_. Such stockholders instead shall

 



-20-  only be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of
Common Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall
have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have waived, withdrawn, or
otherwise are not entitled to, the right to appraisal of such shares of Common
Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
canceled and converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the
Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the
Merger Consideration upon surrender in the manner provided in  _Section
3.9_. The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice of any notice or demand
for appraisal or payment for shares of Common Stock or any withdrawals of such
demands received by the Company, (ii) give Parent the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands and (iii)
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle any such demands.

 

3.9. _Exchange of Common Stock and Paying Fund_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent; Paying Fund_. At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
Parent shall designate a bank or trust company of national recognition and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as agent
for the holders of shares of Common Stock to receive the funds to which
holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_,
to act as paying agent for the holders of Common Stock to receive the funds to
which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_ and
shall enter into a paying agent agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Company relating to the Paying Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.
At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall (i) deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Common Stock, as Certificates and as Book-Entry Shares, cash
sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to
_Sections 2.1(b)_, _2.1(c)_ and _2.1(d)_ (such cash, the " _Payment Fund_ ")
and (ii) make available to the Company (to the extent such amounts are
payable), for the benefit of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and
Warrants, cash sufficient to make payment of the amounts payable with respect
to the Series A Redemption, the Series A Liquidation and the aggregate amount
of any Alternative Issuance . The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose, subject to _Section 3.9(h)_.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in no event later than three (3) Business Days
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of (i) a Certificate whose shares of Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_
(A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall
be in customary form and contain customary provisions) and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration and (ii) Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 3.7(b)_ instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
record of one or more Certificates, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or
the Paying Agent, and each holder of

 



-21-  record of Book-Entry Shares, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Book-Entry Shares (which shall be deemed surrendered upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form or such other evidence
as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.7(b)_, and the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 3.9(b)_, each Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to
the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by the Company on the shares of Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it
shall be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this
_Article III_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_
shall (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration for satisfaction of its
claim for Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the terms of this _Article III_.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any distributions from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to such date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-22- (f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and
subject to _Section 3.9(d)_ , Parent) will issue, or will cause to be issued,
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the payments with
respect to such Certificate to which such Person is entitled pursuant to this
_Article III_.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
and withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or
the Offer such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement and the Offer as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund, as directed by Parent, _provided_ that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article III_ , and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Any interest
or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon
demand.

 

3.10. _Subsequent Actions_. The parties agree to take all necessary action to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Closing without a meeting of the Companys stockholders, as provided in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The

effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed by
the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents. Such internal control over financial
reporting is effective in all material respects in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes,
in each case, in accordance with GAAP. The Companys chief executive officer
and chief financial officer have disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and
the audit committee of the Company Board (I) any "significant deficiencies"
and "material weaknesses" in the design or operation of its internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (II) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting, and in each case the Company has
made available to Parent (or its Representatives) prior to the date of this
Agreement all such disclosures from February 19, 2015 to the date of this
Agreement. The terms "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses"
have the meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act.

between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
contract, agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys financial statements or
other Company SEC Documents.

 

(f) Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in
connection with the Offer (the " _Company Disclosure Documents_ ") (including
the Schedule 14D-9), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when filed,
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders, as
applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company Disclosure Documents,
at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Documents or any
supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

not in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) individually or two
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in the aggregate;  _provided_ ,
however, that the Company shall not settle any Litigation (regardless of the
amount involved) if any such settlement would impose any material obligation
or restriction on the Company from time to time or on the Companys ability
to own or operate any of its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interests therein or require any material changes to the
business of the Company from time to time;

 

(q) adopt or enter into a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation

restrict or delay the Series A Liquidation;

 

(r) enter into any agreement, arrangement or commitment containing covenants
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that impose any material
restrictions on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to compete

its ability to compete with any Person, and would be binding upon Parent or
its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries);

(s) declare or pay any dividend or distribution payable in cash, capital
stock, property or otherwise (or any combination thereof) with respect to any
securities of the Company (other than those required to be paid with respect
to the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Designation),
including Common Stock, or enter into any agreement with respect to the
voting of securities of the Company; or

(t) authorize any of, or agree or commit to do any of, the foregoing actions.

 



-48- Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the Closing. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

6.3. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

6.4. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.4_, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its respective directors and
officers, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its financial
advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents and
representatives (collectively, with its or, as applicable, any
other entitys, Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents, its " _Representatives_ ") to: (i) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with (and provision of
information to) any persons (other than Parent) that may be ongoing with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) not, directly or indirectly,
(A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer, including any
proposal or offer to its stockholders, that constitutes, or could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any other person any information in connection with or for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal (other
than, solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to ascertain facts from
the person making such Company Takeover Proposal for the sole purpose of the
Company Board informing itself about such Company Takeover Proposal and the
person that made it and to refer the inquiring person to this  _Section 6.4_
and to limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such
referral and such ascertaining of facts) or (C) approve, recommend or enter
into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or
similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company acknowledges and agrees
that any action taken by any Representative of the Company which, if taken by
the Company, would be a breach of the provisions set forth in this _Section
6.4_ shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section 6.4_ by the
Company.

 

(b) Anything to the contrary in _Section 6.4(a)_ notwithstanding, if at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
the Company receives a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Company Takeover
Proposal from any person that did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.4_, and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such

 



-49-  Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives
may, (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives; _provided_ that the Company shall substantially
concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided or made available to such person or its Representatives unless such
non-public information has been previously provided to Parent and (ii) engage
in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing if the Company takes any of
the actions in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or
any of its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or any offer,
proposal, inquiry or request for information or discussions relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person
making the Company Takeover Proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or
request and the material terms and conditions thereof (including a copy of
such Company Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or request or, where
such Company Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or request is not in
writing, a description of the material terms thereof). The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (but in no event
more often than once every twenty-four (24) hours, as to the status (including
any material developments, discussions or negotiations) of such Company
Takeover Proposal, offer, proposal, inquiry or request. The Company agrees
that it and its Affiliates will not enter into any agreement with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise complying
with, this _Section 6.4_.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.4(d)_ , neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly announce its intention to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case in any manner adverse to
Parent, the Recommendation, or (B) adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders
of the Company, or publicly announce its intention to adopt, approve or
recommend to stockholders of the Company, a Company Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to, or that is intended or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 6.4(b)_ ) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or resolve,
publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, in response to a Company Superior
Proposal received by the Company after the date of this Agreement on an
unsolicited basis that did not

 



-50-  result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_, (x) make a Change of
Recommendation or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ ;  _provided_ that prior to making such
Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , (A) the Company shall have given Parent at least five
(5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person
making any such Company Superior Proposal and contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed
Company Acquisition Agreement and all related documentation, (B) during such
five (5) Business Day period following the date on which such notice is
received, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to
the extent Parent wishes to engage), which may be on a non-exclusive basis, to
consider adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (C) upon
the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal, and (D) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms
(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any
other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in
each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice period under
clause (A) of this proviso shall commence ( _provided_ that the notice period
thereunder shall only be three (3) Business Days) during which time the
Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.4(d)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A)
through (D) above of this proviso; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
_Section 6.4_.

(e) The foregoing notwithstanding, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company Board may, solely in response to an Intervening Event, make a Change
of Recommendation, if the Company and the Company Board have complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this _Section 6.4_ and the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Company Board to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board shall not be entitled to effect such a Change of Recommendation
until (A) the Company shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days
prior written notice of its intent to effect a Change of Recommendation and
specifying the reasons therefor, which notice shall include a description the
applicable Intervening Event, (B) during the five (5) Business Day period
following the date on which such notice is received, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate)
to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (C)
following the end of such five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board,
after consultation with the Companys independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel and taking in account any revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent, shall have determined in good
faith that the failure of the Company Board to make such a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company that is required by Law or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6.4(f)_
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Change of
Recommendation other than in accordance with _Section 6.4(d)_ or _Section
6.4(e)_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to limit the
proviso set forth in _Section 6.8_.

 



-51- 6.5. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall approve, as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each agreement,
arrangement or understanding between any of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or any of their Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are effective as of the date of this
Agreement, are contemplated by this Agreement, or are entered into after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time pursuant to which
compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee, and shall take
all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

6.6. _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as practicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain
or make all necessary or appropriate filings required under applicable Law
and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the consummation of the
Transactions as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) (i) The Company and Parent will as soon as practicable but in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice the notification and report forms required for
the Transactions and (ii) subsequent to any filing made hereunder, Parent and
the Company will provide any supplemental information that may be requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, which notification and report
forms and supplemental information will comply in all material respects with
the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly
furnish to the other (x) all necessary information as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any filing or submission
pursuant to the HSR Act and (y) copies of all substantive written
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of any oral
communication) with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Company can redact
discussions of the transaction value and reasonably designate applicable
materials as for review by the others outside counsel only. The parties shall
also consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in
advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,

 



-52-  arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act
or any other Competition Laws;  _provided_ , _however_ , in the event of any
dispute between Parent and the Company regarding the strategy relating to any
such proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition
Laws, Parent shall make the final decision regarding such strategy. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree to (w) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings, substantive telephone calls or
discussions with any Governmental Authority in connection with or relating to
the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws, (i) give each other an opportunity
to participate in each of such meetings, substantive telephone calls or
discussions, (x) to the extent practicable, give each other
reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications with any
Governmental Authority in connection with or relating to the HSR Act or any
other Competition Laws, (y) if any Governmental Authority initiates a
substantive oral communication in connection with or relating to the HSR Act
or any other Competition Laws, promptly notify the other party of the
substance of such communication, (ii) provide each other with a reasonable
advance opportunity to review and comment upon all written communications
(including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals) with a Governmental Authority in connection with or relating to
the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws and (z) provide each other with
copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental Authority in
connection with or relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Company can redact discussions
of the transaction value and reasonably designate applicable materials as for
review by the others outside counsel only.

(c) The parties shall (i) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable and
advisable to any inquiries or requests for documentation or information or any
request for additional information (a "second request"), under the HSR Act
received from a Governmental Authority and to all other inquiries and
requests received from a Governmental Authority in connection with Competition
Law matters, and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to resolve objections,
if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions under any Competition Laws and to cause the waiting periods,
approvals or other requirements under the HSR Act and all other Competition
Laws to terminate or expire or be obtained prior to the Termination Date.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the
efforts referenced in _Section 6.6(c)_ and this _Section 6.6(d)_ to obtain
all necessary consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of any
Governmental Authority required, or considered by Parent to be advisable to be
obtained pursuant to the HSR Act, each party to this Agreement shall: (i)
cooperate fully with the other parties hereto, shall execute and deliver such
further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and shall take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested by any other party hereto
to evidence or reflect the Merger (including the execution and delivery of all
documents, certificates, agreements and instruments reasonably necessary for
all filings hereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the Company
can redact discussions of the transaction value and reasonably designate
applicable materials as for review by the others outside counsel only; (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to give all notices (if any) required to be made
and given by such party to any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions; (iii) use reasonable best
efforts to obtain each approval, consent, ratification, permission, waiver
or authorization required to be obtained by

 



-53-  such party in connection with the Offer and the Merger or any of the other
Transactions; and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Offer and the Merger. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, shall (x) commit, agree, or
submit (or offer to commit, agree, or submit) to any consent decree, hold
separate order, sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposal, Lien,
other change or restructuring of, or operating restriction with respect to the
businesses, properties, product lines, assets, permits, operations, rights, or
interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (y) commit, agree, or submit (or offer to commit, agree, or
submit) to any action or agree to any remedies, terms or conditions in
connection with its obligations under this Section 6.6; provided that
those actions, remedies, terms or conditions (1) are conditioned on the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger and (2) would not have an adverse
impact on Parent following the completion of the Transactions that would be
material to Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), on a consolidated basis _pro forma_ for the completion of the
Transactions. If requested by Parent, the Company (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, as appropriate) will agree to any action contemplated by this
_Section 6.6_; _provided_ that any such agreement or action is conditioned on
the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. The parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this section so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall bear the
cost of any filing fee payable to a Governmental Authority in connection with
any filings made under this _Section 6.6_.

6.7. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the one (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing, to the extent that each
such employee remains employed with Parent or any of its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Company) as of and following the Closing (any such employee,
a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with: (i) at least the same annual base salary
or wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) at least
the same cash bonus or other short-term cash incentive
opportunities (excluding any equity-based incentive opportunities) provided
to such Continuing Employee by the Company in respect of the fiscal year in
which the Closing Date occurs, (iii) equity-based incentive compensation
opportunities on terms no less favorable than those that Parent provides to
similarly situated employees of Parent, and (iv) employee benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those employee benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date
until December 31, 2017 and, for the remainder, the same employee benefits as
are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Without limiting the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall provide, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated by Parent or its Subsidiaries without cause during the one (1) year
period immediately following the Closing Date with severance benefits on the
terms and conditions and at the levels set forth on _Section 6.7(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter_ , determined (A) without taking into account any
reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such Continuing Employee
and (B) by taking into account each Continuing Employees service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the
Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



-54- (b) Periods of employment of Continuing Employees with the Company or any of
its current or former Affiliates, to the extent recognized under any
comparable Company Benefit Plan of the Company and its Affiliates, including
their predecessor entities (and if no such comparable Company Benefit Plan
exists, as such service would generally be recognized by the Company prior to
the Closing Date), shall be taken into account for all purposes, including, as
applicable, eligibility for participation, vesting, level of benefits and
benefit accrual, of the corresponding employee benefit plan offered by Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent to the Continuing Employees, including vacation
plans or arrangements, defined contribution, and any severance and welfare
plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be
required to recognize such service (i) for purposes of benefit accrual under
defined benefit pension plans, or (ii) to the extent such credit would result
in duplication of benefits. Additionally, Parent shall (A) waive
any limitation on health insurance coverage of the Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions under all applicable
health care plans of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to the extent such
condition was satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Closing Date and (B) credit all Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents with all payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums
and deductible payments and co-payments paid by such Person, in each case,
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date during
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (or if later, the plan year in
which such Person becomes eligible to participate in a plan of Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent) for the purpose of determining the extent to which any
such Person has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has
reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any health insurance plans of Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent for such year.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all
Company Benefit Plans (other than Company Equity Plans) in accordance with
their terms.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or
any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan
or from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee. Without
limiting _Section 9.11_, the provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are solely for
the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this
_Section 6.7_, express or implied, shall confer upon any Continuing
Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or other Person, any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement or a right of any employee or beneficiary of
such employee or other Person under an employee benefit plan that such
employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under the
terms of that employee benefit plan without regard to this Agreement.

6.8. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be joint and in a form agreed to by the parties and the
parties shall consult with each other before issuing any subsequent press
release or making any other public announcement with respect to this

 



-55-  Agreement and the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement without the prior consent of the other party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
_provided_ that (a) a party may, without the prior consent of the other party
(but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such press release or make such public announcement to the extent
required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or by
any regulatory authority, (b) each of the Company and Parent may make press
releases or public communications concerning this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger that consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous
press releases or announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in
compliance with this _Section 6.8_ and (c) each of the Company and
Parent may make any public statements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors or analysts or those participating in investor calls or
industry conferences, so long as such statements consist solely of information
previously disclosed in previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this _Section
6.8_; _provided_ , _further,_ that in the case of press releases or public
announcements by the Company with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal,
the Company shall not be required to consult with Parent but shall give Parent
a copy of any such press release or public announcement prior to the issuance
thereof.

 

6.9. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with
the Transactions), now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided
in the Organizational Documents of the Company or any such Subsidiary or in
any written agreement set forth on _Section 6.9(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_ (the " _Indemnity Agreements_ ") shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms to the extent
provided in the following sentence. From and after the Effective Time for a
period of six (6) years, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company
to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses (subject to
the Person to whom expenses are advanced providing an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification) to, any
individual who, on or prior to the Effective Time, was an officer or director
of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_
") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such
at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law as required by (x) the Organizational Documents of the Company or any
such Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (y) the
Indemnity Agreements, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that
would adversely affect the indemnification rights thereunder of any
Indemnitees. The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of the Indemnity Agreements.

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)_ , during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
to the fullest extent permitted

 



-56-  under applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee
against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection
with any Litigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
to the extent such Litigation arises out of or pertains to the fact that an
Indemnitee is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or an officer, director or trustee of any other Person at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Effective
Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such
Litigation the expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of
any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.

 

(c) The Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Companys existing policies;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
maximum aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies for any such year
shall not be in excess of the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by
the immediately following sentence. If the Company or the Surviving Company
for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, there shall be no breach of this provision so long as (i) the
Surviving Company shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms
that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will cause the
Surviving Company to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys
DandO Insurance as of the date hereof with comparable DandO Insurance that

of this Agreement advising such holders of their right (and the requirements
to be met to secure such right) to require the redemption of such shares of
Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Series A Redemption Offer_ "). Such notice
shall also include a request that each holder of Series A Preferred Stock
shall waive any notice periods that are required for the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger.

(ii) As soon as practicable after the receipt by the Company of a written
instrument from the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66

redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price per share
equal to the Series A Redemption Price (the " _Series A Redemption_ ") in
accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation with respect
to the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock under Section 5(c) thereof;
provided that the Companys obligation to consummate the Series A Redemption
shall be subject to (A) the receipt of the Series A Notice no later than
thirty (30) days after receipt of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock of
the Series A Redemption Offer and (B) the occurrence of the Closing
substantially concurrently therewith.

(b) _Warrants_.

 

(i) In accordance with the provisions of Section 4.5 of the Warrant Agreement,
promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, send written notice to (A) the Warrant
Agent of the reduction of the Warrant Price contemplated by the final proviso
of Section 4.4 of the Warrant Agreement, which notice shall state the Warrant
Price resulting from the Transactions and set forth in reasonable detail the
method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based and
(B) each holder of the Warrants advising such holders of the effective date

Warrants are exercisable at the adjusted Warrant Price, and that the Warrants
have become exercisable only for the Alternative Issuance, and not for
shares of Common Stock;

(ii) In accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 of the Warrant
Agreement, promptly following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to make public disclosure of the consummation of the Transactions by
filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC.

 



-58- (iii) At Parents election, the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, may permit any Warrant to be exercised on a "cashless basis"
to the extent such Warrant is not otherwise exercisable on a "cashless basis"
pursuant to the terms of such Warrant; and

 

(iv) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to file or cause to be filed

deregistration is not prohibited by the Securities Act.

6.11. _Exchange Delisting; Listing_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Company of the Common Stock from NASDAQ and
the deregistration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

6.12. _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions is brought
against either party or any directors or executive officers of either party
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Transaction Litigation_ "), such party shall promptly notify the other party
of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep such other party reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense of any
Transaction Litigation against the Company or any of its directors or
executive officers, and the Company shall not settle or agree to settle
any Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Prior to the Closing, Parent
shall give the Company the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the
defense of any Transaction Litigation against Parent or any of its directors
or executive officers, solely to the extent such Transaction Litigation could
prevent or delay the Offer Closing or the Closing Date.

 

6.13. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities pursuant to the
Transactions by each individual (including any Person who is deemed to be a
"director by deputization" under applicable securities Laws) who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with applicable SEC rules
and regulations and interpretations of the SEC staff.

6.14. _Takeover Law_. Neither Parent nor the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Law to become
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other Transactions,
and each of Parent and the Company shall take all

 



-59-  necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other Transactions from any applicable
Takeover Law now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Law may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and to otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any of the
Transactions.

 

6.15. _Payoff_. The Company shall, upon the request of Parent, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent, (a) at least
one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, customary payoff letters with
respect to each of the Existing Credit Facilities and (b) prior to the Closing
Date, other customary documents relating to the release of the Liens securing
the Existing Credit Facilities.

6.16. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time (a)
the Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub: (i) of any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) of
receipt of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions and (iii) of any Litigation commenced or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving
or otherwise affecting the Company that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any
Section of this Agreement or that relates to the consummation of any of the
Transactions; and (b) Parent shall provide prompt notice to the Company: (i)
of any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions and
obtaining such consent would (in the good faith determination of Parent)
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions, (ii) of receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and (iii) of any
Litigation commenced or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Parent or Merger Sub that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have
been disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or that relates to
the consummation of any of the Transactions; provided, further, that a partys
good faith failure to comply with this Section 6.16 shall not provide any
other party the right not to effect the Transactions, except to the extent
that any other provision of this Agreement independently provides such right.

 

6.17. _FIRPTA_. The Company shall provide Parent with a duly completed and
executed statement, issued pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections
1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3)(i), certifying that shares of Company stock are
not United States real property interests within the meaning of Section 897(c)
of the Code, together with an executed notice described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.892-2(h)(2) that Parent shall cause to be sent to the
Internal Revenue Service in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.897-2(h)(2); _provided_ that Parents sole recourse if the Company fails to
provide such statement or notice shall be that Parent shall be entitled to
deduct or withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) such amounts from
the Merger Consideration or the Offer Price payable to a holder of Company
common stock as may be required to be deducted or withheld from such payment
to such holder under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (including Treasury

 



-60-  Regulations Section 1.897-2(g)(3)) in accordance with _Section 3.9(g)_ , but
the Company shall not otherwise be considered in breach of the covenant set
forth in this _Section 6.17_ for purposes of this Agreement (including clause
(c) of _Annex I_ ).

(i) prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have

Sub to consummate the Transactions (including the Offer and the Merger) and
(B) is incapable of being cured or, if curable, has not been cured, by the
Company prior to the earlier of the (x) Termination Date and (y) thirtieth
(30th) Business Day after its receipt of written notice thereof from Parent;

Agreement, which breach would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth
in _Article VII_ ; or

 

(ii) if the Company Board shall have made a Change of Recommendation.

or Willful Breach.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to _Section

termination and as a condition to such termination in the case of a
termination by the Company or as promptly as reasonably practicable in the
case of a termination pursuant by Parent (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days following such termination), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to  _Section 8.1(b)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ as a
result of a Willful Breach by the Company that occurs following the
announcement referenced in clause (B) below, and (A) if all conditions in
_Annex I_  that are capable of being satisfied prior to Offer Acceptance Time
have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
other than the Minimum Condition or any of the conditions set forth in clauses
(b), (c) or (e) of  _Annex I_ , (B) at any time after the date of this
Agreement, and prior to such termination (unless publicly withdrawn prior to

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the
Company Termination Fee, such payment to be made within two (2) Business Days
from the earliest to occur of the foregoing events, payable by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent; _provided_
that, for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ , all references in the
definition of Company Takeover Proposal to twenty-five percent (25%) shall be
deemed references to fifty percent (50%); or

(iii) this Agreement is validly terminated by (x) Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ and at the time of such termination all
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ have been satisfied other than (A) clauses
(a), (d) or (f) of _Annex I_ (but in the case of clause (f), only if the
applicable Order relates to an Antitrust Law) and (B)

 



-63-  conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance
Time but that are capable of being satisfied if the Offer Acceptance Time were
to occur on the date of such termination or (y) Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ but only if the applicable Order relates to an
Antitrust Law, then Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee) thirty-
five million dollars ($35,000,000) (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), such
payment to be made within two (2) Business Days following the date of
termination of this Agreement, payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that (i) in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion and (ii) in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party hereto fails to promptly
pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and the other
party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the failing party
for the amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_ or a portion thereof, the
failing party shall pay to the other party all fees, costs and expenses of
enforcement (including attorneys fees as well as expenses incurred in
connection with any such action), together with interest on such amount or
such portion thereof at the prime lending rate as published in the _Wall
Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is required to be made.
The amounts payable by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, other than in the case
of fraud or Willful Breach, shall be, together with any amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_ , (i) the sole monetary remedy of Parent in
the event of a termination of this Agreement where the Company Termination Fee
is payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and the Company
Termination Fee is actually paid to Parent and (ii) the sole monetary remedy
of the Company in the event of a termination of this Agreement where the
Parent Termination Fee is payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_
and the Parent Termination Fee is actually paid to the Company.

 



-64- 8.4. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable remedies
to prevent and restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in
any court specified in _Section 9.7_, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) any party has
an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (including by operation of law) by
any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties;
_provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub may assign any of their rights and
obligations under this Agreement to another wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent without the prior written consent of the Company, but no
such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement.
Any purported assignment in contravention of this _Section 9.10_ shall be
null and void.

9.11. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the parties hereto and, except for (i) the indemnified parties under
_Sections 6.9_ and (ii) holders of Common Stock, Company Options, Series A
Preferred Stock and Warrants, with respect to the enforcement of  _Article
III_ from and after the Effective Time, no provision of this Agreement shall
be deemed to confer upon third parties, either express or implied, any remedy,
claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

 

9.12. _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Parent or the
Surviving Company, each party will, on and after the Closing Date, execute
and deliver to the other parties such other documents, assignments and other
instruments as may be reasonably required to effectuate the Merger and to
effect and evidence the provisions of this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

9.13. _Entire Understanding_. The Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement set forth the entire agreement and understanding of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any
and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



-68- 9.14. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

9.15. _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.

_[Signature Page to Merger Agreement]_ _Annex I_

 

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

THE CAPITALIZED TERMS USED HEREIN HAVE THE MEANINGS SET FORTH IN THE
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER TO WHICH THIS ANNEX I IS ATTACHED.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer, but subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent
shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject
to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c)
under the Exchange Act (relating to Parents obligation to pay for or return
tendered shares of Common Stock promptly after termination or withdrawal of
the Offer), pay for any shares of Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to
the Offer (and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date and
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for) in the event that, at the
Expiration Date, any of the following conditions have not been met:

(a) There shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn shares of
Common Stock that, considered together with all other shares of Common Stock
(if any) beneficially owned by Parent and its Affiliates (excluding any shares
of Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have
not yet been received), represent one more share of Common Stock than 50% of
the sum of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the
time of the expiration of the Offer plus (ii) the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock issuable to holders of Company Options from which the Company
has received notices of exercise prior to the expiration of the Offer (and as
to which shares of Common Stock have not yet been issued to such exercising
holders of Company Options) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

(b) (i) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Sections 4.1(a)_ ,  _4.1(c)(i)_ , _4.1(c)(iii)_ , _4.2_ , _4.3(iii)_ and
_4.18_ shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Offer Acceptance Time as though made as of the Offer Acceptance Time
(except to the extent that any such representation and warranty speaks as of
any earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such earlier date) in all material respects;

 

(ii) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section
4.1(c)(ii) shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Offer Acceptance Time as though made as of the Offer Acceptance Time
(except to the extent that any such representation and warranty speaks as of
any earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be
true and correct as of such earlier date), except for any failures to be so
true and correct that are _de minimis_ ;

 

(iii) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
second sentence of _Section 4.14_ shall be true and correct in all respects
as of the date of this Agreement at and as of the Offer Acceptance Time as
though made as of the Offer Acceptance Time;

 

(iv) Other than the representations and warranties listed in the immediately
preceding sentence, each of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality, Company
Material Adverse Effect or like qualifications therein) shall be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty speaks as of any earlier date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier
date), except, in each case, for such failures to be true and correct as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. (c) The Company shall have duly performed and complied with, in all material
respects, the covenants, obligations and agreements contained in this
Agreement to be performed and complied with by it at or prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time;

 

(d) Any applicable waiting period relating to the Offer Closing under the HSR
Act (or any extensions thereof) or any other antitrust Law shall have expired
or been earlier terminated;

(e) Parent and Merger Sub shall have received a certificate executed on behalf
of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer
confirming that the conditions set forth in clauses " _(b)_ " and " _(c)_ " of
this _Annex I_ have been duly satisfied;

 

(f) No Order shall have been issued or entered by any Governmental Authority
which restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the
Transactions;

(g) This Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms
(the " _Termination Condition_ "); and

(h) Unless the holder(s) of Series A Preferred Stock have waived their right
to receive written notice forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date, at
least forty-five (45) days shall have elapsed from the date of the Series A
Redemption Offer pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)(i)_.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
(except for the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and conditions
"(d)" and " _(f)_ " above) may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent
and Merger Sub. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.
