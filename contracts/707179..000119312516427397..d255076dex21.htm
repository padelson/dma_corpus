another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Old National and
Anchor. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_."

 

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and the IBCL.

(collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ ")) and Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into
the right to receive the following, without interest:

fully paid and nonassessable shares of Old National Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ ");

 



2  it being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to _Section
1.4_, the Old National Common Stock, including the shares issued to former
holders of Anchor Common Stock as Merger Consideration, shall be the common
stock of the Surviving Corporation; and

(iii) For each share of Anchor Common Stock other than shares as to which a
Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked or
deemed revoked pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (collectively, the " _Non-Election
Shares_ "), the right to receive such Stock Consideration or Cash
Consideration as is determined in accordance with _Section 2.1_.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

(i) The " _Exchange Ratio_ " means 3.5505. 

(ii) The " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " means $48.50.

 

(iii) The " _Merger Consideration_ " means the Cash Consideration and/or Stock
Consideration described in  _Section 1.5(a)_, as applicable.

(c) All of the shares of Anchor Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an "
_Old Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old
Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Anchor Common Stock)
previously representing any such shares of Anchor Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Cash Consideration
and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, _Sections
1.5(a)_ , _2.1_ and  _2.2_ and (ii) any dividends or distributions which the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_. Old
Certificates previously representing shares of Anchor Common Stock shall be
exchanged for evidence of shares in book entry form (including fractional
shares) (collectively referred to herein as " _New Certificates_ "),
representing the Stock Consideration (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or the Cash Consideration, as applicable,
upon the surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with _Section 2.5_,
without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Old National Common Stock or Anchor Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to give
holders of Anchor Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Anchor Common Stock that are owned by Anchor or
Old National (in each case other than the Exception Shares) shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist and 

 



3  neither the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(e) If the Environmental Costs are greater than $5,000,000, then the Exchange
Ratio shall be decreased to a quotient determined by dividing the Adjusted
Purchase Price by the total number of shares of Anchor Common Stock
outstanding at the Effective Time (including all Anchor Restricted Stock
Awards), and further dividing that number by Initial Old National Market
Value.

 

As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated below:

 

(i) The " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to (x) the Stock Purchase
Price less (y) the Environmental Costs.

(ii) The " _Stock Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to the Exchange Ratio in
effect at the time of adjustment multiplied by the Initial Old National
Market Value multiplied by the total number of shares of Anchor Common Stock
outstanding as of the Effective Time (including all Anchor Restricted Stock
Awards).

 

1.6 _Treatment of Anchor Restricted Stock Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Anchor Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under
the Anchor Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Anchor Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall be treated as follows:

 

(i) Each Anchor Restricted Stock Award outstanding as of the date hereof which
has not previously lapsed or vested (the total amount of which shall not
exceed 162,806 shares of restricted stock) shall fully vest and shall be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_ based on the
holders election in accordance with and subject to _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_
and treating the shares of Anchor Common Stock subject to such Anchor
Restricted Stock Award in the same manner as all other shares of Anchor Common
Stock for such purposes. Old National shall pay or issue the consideration
described in this _Section 1.6(a)_ as contemplated by _Section 2.5_.

 

(ii) Each Anchor Restricted Stock Award granted after the date hereof and
which has not previously lapsed or vested (the total amount of which shall
not exceed a number shares of restricted stock having a market value in excess
of $2,427,000 calculated as of the date of grant of such shares) shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into a number of restricted shares of Old National Common Stock
equal to the number of shares of Anchor Common Stock subject to such Anchor
Restricted Stock Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio on the terms and
conditions (including, if applicable, any continuing vesting requirements)
otherwise applicable under the Anchor Stock Plan and applicable award
agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that no
Anchor Restricted Stock Award granted after the date hereof shall become
vested solely by reason of consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement but may, in the

 



4  discretion of Anchor, be granted pursuant to terms whereby vesting will
accelerate upon a termination of the holders employment without "Cause" or
for "Good Reason" (within the meaning of the Anchor Stock Plan as in effect
on the date hereof) following the Effective Time.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Anchor, the Board of Directors of
Anchor and/or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 1.6_.

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Anchor Stock Plan_ " means the
Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

1.7 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of Old National, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and
applicable law.

 

1.8 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Old National, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and
applicable law.

1.9 _Directors and Officers_. At and immediately after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the
directors and officers of Old National in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time until their respective successor are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (a)
the parties intend that (i) the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) Old National and
Anchor shall each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(b) of the Code, and (b) this Agreement is intended to be, and
is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354,
361 and 368 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section
1.368-2(g).

1.11 _Bank Merger_. Effective simultaneously with the consummation of the
Merger, AnchorBank will merge with and into Old National Bank pursuant to an
agreement and plan of merger to be agreed upon by Old National and Anchor,
which agreement shall be in form and substance customary for mergers similar
to the Bank Merger (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). Old National Bank shall
be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of AnchorBank shall cease. Prior to the Effective
Time, Anchor shall cause AnchorBank, and Old National shall cause Old
National Bank, to execute such certificates or articles of merger and such
other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger
effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") simultaneously with the
consummation of the Merger.

1.12 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At Old Nationals election
delivered to Anchor in writing, the Merger may alternatively be structured so
that (a) Anchor is merged with and into any other direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Old National or (b) any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Old National is merged with and into Anchor; provided,

 



5  however, that no such change shall (x) alter or change the amount or kind of
the Merger Consideration or the treatment of the Anchor Common Stock or the
Anchor Restricted Stock Awards, (y) prevent the parties from obtaining the
opinions of counsel referred to in _Sections 7.2(c)_ and _7.3(c)_ or otherwise
cause the transaction to fail to qualify for the tax treatment described in
_Section 1.10_, or (z) impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of such an election, the parties
agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement (to the extent
such amendment only changes the method of effecting the business combination
and does not substantively affect this Agreement or the rights and obligations
of the parties or their respective shareholders) in order to reflect such
election.

 

ARTICLE II

_EXCHANGE OF SHARES_

2.1 _Proration_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Anchor Common Stock (including shares subject to Anchor
Restricted Stock Awards) to be entitled to receive the Cash Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ shall be equal to the product (rounded up to the
nearest whole share) of (i) 0.40 and (ii) the total number of shares of
Anchor Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including for these purposes the shares subject to Anchor Restricted
Stock Awards, but excluding the shares of Anchor Common Stock to be cancelled
as provided in _Section 1.5(d)_, Exception Shares and Dissenting Shares)
(the " _Cash Conversion Number_ "). All other shares of Anchor Common Stock
(including shares subject to Anchor Restricted Stock Awards, but excluding
the shares of Anchor Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in _Section
1.5(d)_, Exception Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 

(b) Promptly (and in any event no later than two (2) business days) after the
Effective Time, Old National shall effect the allocation among holders of
Anchor Common Stock and Anchor Restricted Stock Awards of rights to receive
the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

 

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Anchor Common Stock (including shares
subject to Anchor Restricted Stock Awards) with respect to which Cash
Elections shall have been made (the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the
Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration,
and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Cash
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number
of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the
Cash Election Number, with the remaining number of such holders Cash Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

 



6 (ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election
Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

 

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the
total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the
total number of Stock Election Shares, with the remaining number of such
holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration.

 

2.2 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Anchor Common
Stock and Anchor Restricted Stock Awards to be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration in accordance
with, and subject to, _Sections 1.5(a)_ and _2.1_ (a " _Holder_ ") shall have
the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this  _Article II_ , to
submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) Each Holder other than holders of Dissenting Shares may specify in a
request made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.2_ (herein
called an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of shares of Anchor Common Stock
owned by such Holder (or subject to such Anchor Restricted Stock Awards) with
respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the
number of shares of Anchor Common Stock owned by such Holder (or subject to
such Anchor Restricted Stock Awards) with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Cash Election.

(b) Old National shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to Anchor,
including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as
prepared by Old National and reasonably acceptable to Anchor (the " _Form of
Election_ "), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election.

 



7 (c) Old National (i) shall initially make available and mail the Form of
Election not less than thirty (30) business days prior to the anticipated
Election Deadline to Holders of record as of the business day prior to such
mailing date, and (ii) following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable
efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any
stockholder or holder of Anchor Restricted Stock Awards who requests such Form
of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The time period between such
mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as the "
_Election Period_ ".

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if Old National shall
have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Old Certificates representing
all certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, "
_Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the
principal office of Old National is located) on the date which the parties
shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) business days preceding the
Closing Date. The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably
satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline
not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at least five (5)
business days prior to, the Election Deadline.

(e) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his or her Election by written notice to Old National prior to the Election
Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of
Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of
Anchor Common Stock or any shares subject to Anchor Restricted Stock Awards
(none of Old National nor Anchor being under any duty to notify any Holder of
any such defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the
shares of Anchor Common Stock, or any shares subject to Anchor Restricted
Stock Awards, covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed
to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter
timely made.

(f) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
Election by written notice received by Old National prior to the Election
Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Old
Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Old Certificates,
previously deposited with Old National. All Elections shall be
automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by Old National or written
notification from the parties that this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(g) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Old
National, in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall
have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of the Forms of Election and
compliance by any Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (ii)
the method of issuance and delivery of New Certificates representing the
whole number of shares of Old National Common Stock into which shares of
Anchor Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iii) the method of
payment of cash for shares of Anchor Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

 



8 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Each issued and outstanding share of Anchor Common
Stock the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right
to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. Anchor shall give
Old National prompt notice upon receipt by Anchor of any such demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Anchor Common Stock, any
withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to
applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter
called a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "). Anchor shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Old National, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the
taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary
to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Anchor shall give Old National the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting
Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. If any Dissenting
Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) his, her or its right to such payment at or prior to the Effective
Time, such holders shares of Anchor Common Stock shall be converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement. If such holder shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after
the Effective Time (or the Election Deadline), each share of Anchor Common
Stock of such holder shall be treated as a Non-Election Share.

 

2.4 _Old National to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Old National shall reserve a sufficient number of shares of
Old National Common Stock to be issued as the Stock Consideration and shall
have and make available cash in an amount sufficient to allow Old National to
make all payments that may be required pursuant to this _Article II_. 

2.5 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than three (3) business days thereafter, Old National shall mail to each
holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Anchor
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Article I_ and that has not theretofore
submitted its Old Certificates with a Form of Election, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Old Certificates to Old National) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Stock Consideration
and/or the Cash Consideration which such holder shall have become entitled to
receive in accordance with, and subject to, _Sections 1.5(a)_ , _2.1_ and
_2.2_ as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)_. From and after the Effective Time and the completion of
the allocation procedure set forth in _Section 2.1_, upon proper surrender of
an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to Old
National, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal or Form
of Election, as applicable, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate
or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as

 



9  applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the Stock Consideration to
which such holder of Anchor Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive
in accordance with, and subject to,  _Sections 1.5(a)_ , _2.1_ and _2.2_
and/or (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the Cash Consideration
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old
Certificate or Old Certificates in accordance with, and subject to, _Sections
1.5(a)_ , _2.1_ and _2.2_ and (B) any dividends or distributions which the
holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_, and the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration
payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.5_ and  _Section 2.2_, each Old Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive,
upon surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration or in respect of dividends
or distributions as contemplated by this _Section 2.5_.

(b) Unless the properly completed Form of Election provides otherwise, for all
purposes of this _Section 2.5_ and in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), (i) a Holder will be treated as having surrendered,
in exchange for the total Cash Consideration, if any, to be paid to such
Holder under Article I (with respect to a Holder, the " _Cash Portion_ "),
the number of shares of Anchor Common Stock of such Holder as to which such
Holder has a right to receive Cash Consideration pursuant to _Sections 1.5_
and _2.1_ ; and (ii) for purposes of clause (i), the Old Certificates
surrendered by a Holder in exchange for such Holders Cash Portion will be
deemed to be: (A) first, of those Old Certificates evidencing shares held by
such Holder for more than one year before the Merger within the meaning of
Section 1223 of the Code, if any, those Old Certificates with the highest
federal income tax basis, in descending order until such Old Certificates are
exhausted or the Cash Portion for such Holder is fully paid, then (B) of all
other of such Holders Old Certificates, those Old Certificates with the
highest federal income tax basis, in descending order until the Cash Portion
for such Holder is fully paid.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Old National
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance
with this _Article II_. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the
Stock Consideration which the shares of Anchor Common Stock represented by
such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(d) If any New Certificate representing shares of Old National Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to Old National in
advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Old National Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of Old National that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



10 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Anchor of the shares of Anchor Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to Old National, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions that the holder
presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to, as provided in this _Article
II_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Anchor for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of Anchor who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Old National Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of Anchor Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Old
National, Anchor, the Surviving Corporation or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Anchor Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Old National shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
applicable Merger Consideration, cash dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ or any other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Anchor Common Stock or Anchor
Restricted Stock Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Old National and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Anchor Common Stock or Anchor Restricted Stock
Awards in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Old
National.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Old
National will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement. Old National in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, may
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate to
deliver a bond in such amount as Old National may reasonably direct (which
amount shall be consistent with Old Nationals customary procedure for Old
Nationals existing shareholders) as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Old National with respect to such Old Certificate.

 



11 ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANCHOR_

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Anchor to Old
National concurrently herewith (the " _Anchor Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Anchor Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Anchor that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this  _Article III_
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this
Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding
the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure
that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in
any Anchor SEC Reports filed by Anchor since December 31, 2014, and prior to
the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature),
Anchor hereby represents and warrants to Old National as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Anchor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Anchor has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Anchor is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Anchor. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Old National, Anchor or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or conditions
(financial or otherwise) of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed
to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements or published interpretations thereof, (B) changes,
after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability
to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C)
changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political
conditions or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or
its Subsidiaries, (D) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declared or
undeclared acts of war or terrorism, (E) disclosure or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this
Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F)
actions or omissions taken pursuant to the written consent or request of Old
National, in the case

 



12  of Anchor, or Anchor, in the case of Old National; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change
are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies
in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the
ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _further_ , that without regard to any other provision of
this Agreement, and without limiting other events or circumstances that may
constitute a "Material Adverse Effect", a "Material Adverse Effect" shall be
deemed to have occurred in the event of the imposition of a formal regulatory
enforcement action against Anchor or AnchorBank following the date of this
Agreement that is reasonably expected to have more than an immaterial impact
on Anchor and its Subsidiaries or Old National and its Subsidiaries. As used
in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any

except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Anchor included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (including any notes

to Anchor concurrently herewith (the " _Old National Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Old National Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Old
National that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result

 



30  in a Material Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a
section of this _Article IV_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section

and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Old National is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or

likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Old National. True and complete

recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Old
National, and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to

authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, 

 



47  approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Without

event later than twenty (20) business days after the date of this Agreement,
Old National and Anchor shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, each prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required in

promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall cooperate with
each other in connection therewith (including the furnishing of any
information and any reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be required
to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals). Old National and Anchor shall
have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each
will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, all the information relating to Anchor or Old
National, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
party will provide the other with copies of any applications and all
correspondence relating thereto prior to filing, other than any portions of
material filed in connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive
business or other proprietary information filed under a claim of
confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult
with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Old
National and Anchor shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur
as soon as possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of businesses or assets of Old National, Anchor
and their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Old National
or its Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any actions specified in this
_Section 6.1_ that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on Old National and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or Anchor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or reduce the benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby to such
a degree that Old National would not have entered into this Agreement had such
conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the date hereof (a "
_Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(d) Old National and Anchor shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and

 



48  such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Old National, Anchor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Old National and Anchor agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time
the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, is filed or becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date it is
filed with the SEC, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of
Anchors meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of
this Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading. Each of Old National and Anchor further
agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would
cause any of the statements in the S-4 or the Proxy Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to
correct the S-4 or the Proxy Statement.

 

(e) Old National and Anchor shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be delayed.

6.2 _Securityholder Litigation_. Each party shall notify the other party
hereto in writing of any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is brought, or, to
the knowledge of either party, threatened in writing, against it and/or the
members of its Board of Directors (any such litigation and/or the executive
officers or members of the Board of Directors of a party (a " _Transaction
Litigation_ ")), and shall keep the other party reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. Each party shall give the other party the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction
Litigation, and, except to the extent required by applicable Law, neither
party shall settle, agree to any undertakings or approve or otherwise agree to
any waiver that may be sought in connection with such Transaction Litigation,
without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.3 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Old
National and Anchor, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all its properties, books,

 



49  contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and
records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute
after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business
operations generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality,
non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the
other party), and, during such period, each of Old National and Anchor shall,
and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party such information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
such party may reasonably request. Each party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the other
partys regular business operations during any such access. Neither Old
National nor Anchor nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Old Nationals or
Anchors, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Each of Old National and Anchor shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_ in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated October 28, 2015, between Old National and Anchor (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations. 

6.4 _Anchor Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) Anchor shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the Anchor
Certificate and Anchor Bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Anchor Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Anchor Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, and upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an
annual or special meeting of shareholders to adopt a merger agreement. The
Board of Directors of Anchor shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from the shareholders of Anchor the Requisite Anchor Vote, including by
communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, if the Board of Directors of Anchor, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would more
likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement
to its shareholders, the Board 

 



50  of Directors of Anchor may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of Anchor may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation
to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law;  _provided_ , that the
Board of Directors of Anchor may not take any actions under this sentence
unless (i) it gives Old National at least two (2) business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of
the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such
action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors
of Anchor in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms
and conditions of, and, to the extent permitted, the identity of the third
party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification
thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances)
and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of Anchor
takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by
Old National and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.

 

(b) Anchor shall adjourn or postpone the Anchor Meeting, if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares
of Anchor Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting Anchor has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Anchor Vote;
_provided_ , that Anchor shall not be required to adjourn or postpone the
Anchor Meeting more than one time pursuant to this first sentence of _Section
6.4(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Anchor Meeting
shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of
Anchor at the Anchor Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of
this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Anchor of such obligation.

 

6.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.4_ of this Agreement, each of Old National and Anchor shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party that is required to be obtained by Anchor or Old National or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Old National shall cause the shares of Old
National Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing
on the Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

 



51 6.7 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Old National shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give
those individuals who are employed by Anchor or its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who continue as employees of Old National or
Old National Subsidiary (each such employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") full
credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of level of
benefits under any employee benefit plans or arrangements that such employees
may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date for such Continuing
Employees service with Anchor or its Subsidiaries to the same extent
recognized by Anchor or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) During the period commencing at the Effective Time, Old National shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each Continuing Employee,
substantially the same compensation and employee benefits on substantially the
same terms and conditions as the Old National offers to similarly situated
officers and employees of Old National.

(c) For each Continuing Employee, Old National shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any Old
National benefit plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Anchor Benefit
Plan, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each such Continuing
Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or co-
insurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Anchor
Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Anchor Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible, co-payment, co-insurance or maximum out-of-pocket
requirements and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with Anchor and
its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any Old National benefit plan to the same
extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Anchor
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing
service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of
any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides retiree welfare
benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides
grandfathered benefits.

 

(d) Old National agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor
all Anchor Benefit Plans, provided that nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit an amendment to or termination of the Anchor Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as of the date hereof.

 

(e) Effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing
Date, AnchorBank shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to terminate
the AnchorBank 401k Plan (" _Bank 401(k) Plan_ "). AnchorBank shall provide
Old National with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments evidencing
that the Bank 401(k) Plan will have been terminated in accordance with its
terms. Prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), AnchorBank
and Old National shall take any and all action as may be required, including
amendments to the Bank 401(k) Plan and/or the taxqualified defined
contribution retirement plan designated by Old National (the " _Old National
KSOP_ ") to (i) permit each

 



52  Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing
Employee from the Bank 401(k) Plan to the Old National KSOP, and (ii) obtain
from the IRS a favorable determination letter on termination for the Bank
401(k) Plan. Each Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Bank 401(k)
Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing Date shall become a participant in
the Old National KSOP as of the Closing Date (giving effect to the service
crediting provisions of _Section 6.7(a)_). However, nothing in this _Section
6.7(e)_ shall prohibit Anchor from making, in a manner consistent with
Anchors past custom or practice, a discretionary matching contribution to the
Bank 401(k) Plan with respect to participant elective deferrals made prior to
the Effective Time.

(f) If requested by Old National in writing within 30 business days prior to
the Effective Time and to the extent permitted under the applicable Anchor
Benefit Plan, effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing Date, Anchor
and its Subsidiaries shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to
terminate each Anchor Benefit Plan requested by Old National to be terminated
(each, a " _Terminated Benefit Plan_ "). Anchor and its Subsidiaries shall
provide Old National with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments
evidencing that each Terminated Benefit Plan has been terminated. All fully
insured welfare benefits (such as health, dental/vision, life/ADandD, LTD), and
Section 125 of the Code, or "cafeteria," plans currently sponsored by Anchor
and its Subsidiaries shall continue as separate plans after the Effective
Time, until such time as Old National determines, in its sole discretion, that
it will terminate any or all of such plans unless Anchor or its Subsidiaries
terminates its Section 125 of the Code or "cafeteria" plan prior to the
Effective Time.

(g) Immediately on or prior to the Effective Time, Anchor or any
Anchor Subsidiary shall, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time,
terminate all annual incentive and/or bonus plans, and the accrued benefits as
of the Closing Date shall be paid in a lump sum on or prior to the Effective
Time on a pro rata basis for the portion of the plan year completed before
the Effective Time, based on the greater of actual performance through the
Effective Time and the target level of performance, except that any annual
incentive and/or bonus plans based upon production shall be paid at actual
performance; provided, however, to the extent a participant has in effect an
employment, retention, change of control, severance or similar agreement with
Anchor or any Anchor Subsidiary or is subject to a policy that provides for a
more favorable result to such participant, such agreement or policy shall
control.

(h) Those employees of Anchor or any Subsidiary as of the Effective Time whom
Old National or its Subsidiaries elect not to employ after the Effective Time
or who are terminated within 12 months from the Effective Time due to
Involuntary Termination (" _Separated Employees_ ") shall be entitled to
severance benefits equal to not less than: (i) 1 week of annual base pay for
each year of service with a minimum of 5 weeks of annual base pay and a
maximum of 26 weeks of annual base pay for those employees with an annual
base pay of $55,100 or less; (ii) 1.25 weeks of annual base pay for each year
of service with a minimum of 8 weeks of annual base pay and a maximum of 32
weeks of annual base pay for those employees with an annual base pay of
$55,101 to $94,499; or (iii) 1.5 weeks of annual base pay for each year of
service with a minimum of 12 weeks of annual base pay and a maximum of 39
weeks of annual base pay for those employees with an annual base pay of
$94,500 or more. For the purpose of this subsection Involuntary Termination
includes a termination by an employee

 



53  whose (1) annual base salary is reduced, below the employees base salary
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (2) total compensation opportunity is
not at least ninety percent (90%) of his or her total compensation
opportunity immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (3) primary work
location is increased by more than twenty (20) miles. Any severance payment
under this subsection will be subject to and conditioned upon the Separated
Employees execution of a severance agreement, in a form customarily used by
Old National for its employees generally, that includes a full release of all
federal and state law claims against Anchor or any Subsidiary and against Old
National or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of the Separated Employees
employment, including any claims based on discrimination. In addition, in
order to receive any severance payments under this subsection, a Separated
Employee must work until the termination date specified by Old National or any
of its Subsidiaries. A year of service will be determined based on each
Separated Employees employment anniversary date and will include service
with Anchor or its Subsidiaries and Anchor or its Subsidiaries. Credit will
be given for partial years of service by rounding up a Separated Employee with
a fractional year of service of six months of service or more to the next full
year and rounding down any Separated Employee with a fractional year of
service that is less than six months of service. For example, a Separated
Employee with ten years and 7 months of service will be credited with eleven
years of service for purposes of determining his or her severance pay. A
Separated Employee with ten years and 4 months of service will be credited
with ten years of service for purposes of determining his or her severance
pay. Effective as of the day following the day which is twelve months after
the Effective Time, all Continuing Employees will be subject to the severance
policies, if any, of Old National in effect at their time of termination
without regard to this _Section 6.7(h)_. Nothing in this  _Section 6.7(h)_
shall be deemed to limit or modify Old Nationals at-will employment policy.

(i) At the Effective Time, Anchor and its Subsidiaries PTO policy shall
terminate and all Continuing Employees shall be subject to Old Nationals
vacation and sick time policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all accrued
and unpaid PTO time of Continuing Employees at the Effective Time, up to but
not beyond one hundred sixty (160) hours per Continuing Employee for sick
time, and 232 hours for vacation time, not to exceed a total of 392 hour (as
adjusted in good faith by the parties to reflect the Closing Date), shall be
carried over to Old Nationals vacation and sick time policies.

(j) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Anchor or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any
right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
Anchor, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Anchor, Old
National or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Anchor or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Anchor Benefit Plan, Old National benefit plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Anchor
Benefit Plan, Old National benefit plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of _Section 9.11_, nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any
current or former employee, officer, director or

 



54  consultant of Anchor or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or
employee of Anchor and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _Anchor Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after
the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Anchor or
any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Old
National and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred
by such Anchor Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law; _provided_ that the Anchor Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Anchor Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Anchor ( _provided_
, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors
of Anchor or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
Anchor for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.
In lieu of the foregoing, Anchor, in consultation with Old National, may (and
at the request of Old National, Anchor shall use its reasonable best efforts
to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
Anchors existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent
that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not
exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Anchor
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or

 



55  surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or
substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in
any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.8_.

 

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Old National and Anchor
under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so
as to adversely affect any Anchor Indemnified Party or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this _Section 6.8_ without the prior written
consent of the affected Anchor Indemnified Party.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Old National and Anchor shall each promptly advise
the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _Article
VII_ ; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section
6.9_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to
be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying fact, change,
event or circumstance would independently result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Anchor shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and cause its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Anchor Vote, in the event Anchor receives an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions
would be more likely than not to to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing
any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, Anchor shall have provided such information to Old National, and
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with Anchor. Anchor will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and the Representatives of Anchor and its Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Old
National with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) request and confirm the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not terminate,
waive,

 



56  amend, release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or standstill
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the
provisions of any such agreement. Anchor will promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Old National following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms
and conditions of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Old National of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current
basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry
or Acquisition Proposal. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, Anchor shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and cause its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and
representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to and entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.10(a)_)
relating to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, or proposal relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Anchor and
its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities
of Anchor or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Anchor, (ii) any tender
offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class
of equity or voting securities of Anchor or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated
assets of Anchor, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other
business combination involving Anchor or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated
assets of Anchor.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Anchor or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.11 _Public Announcements_. Anchor and Old National shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required
by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity
or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange or as permitted by this Agreement, Anchor and Old
National agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval
of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the
extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither Old National nor Anchor shall take any
action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and each of Old National and Anchor shall take all necessary steps to exempt
(or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other

 



57  transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Old National and
Anchor will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.13 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Anchor and Old National
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of Anchor subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act (the " _Anchor Insiders_ "), both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that Anchor Insiders not be subject to a risk
of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of
Anchor Common Stock and Anchor Restricted Stock Awards in the Merger, and for
that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this
_Section 6.13_. The Board of Directors of Old National and of Anchor, or a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall promptly, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Anchor Common Stock or Anchor
Restricted Stock Awards and (ii) any acquisitions of Old National Common
Stock and/or equity awards of Old National by any Anchor Insiders who,
immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

6.14 _Environmental_.

 

(a) If requested by Old National, Anchor will reasonably cooperate with an
environmental consulting firm designated by Old National in connection with
the conduct by such firm of a phase one and/or phase two environmental
investigation on all real property owned or leased by Anchor or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and any real property acquired
or leased by Anchor or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this
Agreement. Old National shall be responsible for the costs of the phase ones
and, if phase twos are determined to be advisable by the environmental
consulting firm, Anchor and Old National shall each be responsible for 50% of
the costs of the phase twos.

(b) If the environmental consultants good faith estimate, based upon the
results of the environmental studies and other diligence conducted by the
environmental consultant, of the dollar amount, if any, that Anchor and its
Subsidiaries would be required to expend under applicable Environmental Laws
for cleanup, remediation and penalties relating to pollutants, contaminants,
wastes, toxic substances, petroleum products and any other materials regulated
under the Environmental Laws with respect to Anchor or its Subsidiaries owned
or leased real property or any adjoining properties (calculated on an after-
tax basis, the " _Environmental Costs_ "), is in excess of $12,000,000, then
Old National shall have the right to

 



58  terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, which termination
shall be Old Nationals sole remedy if Old National elects to terminate
pursuant to  _Section 8.1(e)_.

disqualified individuals in respect of Anchor, its Subsidiaries or their
successors, and that otherwise should be allowable as deductions for federal
income tax purposes, should not be disallowed as deductions for such purposes
by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(e) _Anchor Consolidated Shareholders  Equity_. As of the end of the month
prior to the Effective Time, the Anchor Consolidated Shareholders Equity (as
such term is defined below), shall not be less than $360,797,000. " _Anchor

the date of this Agreement and (except to the extent such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date, provided that no representation or warranty of
Old National, except for _Section 4.2(a)_ hereof (other than such failures
to be true and correct as are de minimis), shall be deemed untrue, inaccurate
or incorrect for purposes hereunder as a consequence of the existence of any
fact, event or circumstance inconsistent with such representation or
warranty, unless such fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any
representations or warranty of Old National, has had or would result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Old National. Anchor shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Old National by the Chief Executive Officer
and any Executive Vice President of Old National to the foregoing effect. 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Old National_. Old National shall have
performed in all material respects the obligations required to be performed
by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Anchor shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of Old National by the Chief
Executive Officer and any Executive Vice President of Old National to
the foregoing effect.

(c) _Federal Tax Opinion_. Anchor shall have received the opinion of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Anchor, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, on
the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to
in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a transaction that qualifies
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In
rendering such opinion, counsel may require and rely upon representations
contained in certificates of officers of Old National and Anchor, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel.

 



61 ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TERMINATION_

8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of Anchor:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Old National and Anchor in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Old National or Anchor if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or
the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Old National or Anchor if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is nine (9) months following the date
of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein, _provided_ , _however_ , that Old
National may extend the Termination Date by three (3) months (the " _Extension
Period_ ") if (x) on the date that is nine (9) months following the date of
this Agreement all of the conditions in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or
waived except for the conditions in _Section 7.1(e)(i)_ and (y)
Old National, in good faith, reasonably believes that the conditions in
_Section 7.1(e)(i)_ will be satisfied prior to the expiration of the
Extension Period and Old National delivers to Anchor a certificate signed on
behalf of Old National by the Chief Executive Officer and any Executive Vice
President of Old National to the foregoing effect;

(d) by either Old National or Anchor ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any
of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties
(or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in
this Agreement on the part of Anchor, in the case of a termination by Old
National, or Old National, in the case of a termination by Anchor, which
breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all
other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_, in the
case of a termination by Old National, or _Section 7.3_, in the case of a
termination by Anchor, and which is not cured by the earlier of the
Termination Date and the date that is 45 days following written notice to
Anchor, in the case of a termination by Old National, or Old National, in the
case of a termination by Anchor, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured
during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination
Date);

 



62 (e) by Old National, if it elects to exercise its right to terminate pursuant
to  _Section 6.14_.

(f) by Old National, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Anchor Vote is
obtained, Anchor or the Board of Directors of Anchor (A) submits this
Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws, modifies, or qualifies (or discloses its intention to
withdraw, modify or qualify) its recommendation as contemplated by _Section
6.4(a)_ in a manner adverse to Old National, or fails to reaffirm such
recommendation within two (2) business days after Old National requests in
writing that such action be taken, or recommends to its shareholders an
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, (B) recommended or endorsed an
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) breaches its obligations under _Section 6.4_ or
_6.10_ in any material respect or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for
outstanding shares of Anchor Common Stock is commenced or publicly disclosed
(other than by Old National or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of
Directors of Anchor recommends that the shareholders of Anchor tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that
such shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten
(10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act; or

 

(g) by Anchor, if both of the following conditions are satisfied at any time
during the five (5) day period commencing on the Determination Date, such
termination to be effective on the tenth (10th) day following the
Determination Date: (i) the Old National Market Value on the Determination
Date is less than $10.67 and (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Old
National Market Value on the Determination Date by the Initial Old National
Market Value shall be less than the number obtained by dividing (x) the Final
Index Price by (y) the Initial Index Price minus 0.20; _subject_ , _however_
, to the following three sentences. If Anchor elects to exercise its
termination right pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to Old National. During the five (5) business day
period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Old National shall have the
option to increase the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (x) a quotient,
the numerator of which is equal to the product of the Initial Old National
Market Value, the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), and the Index Ratio
minus 0.20 and the denominator of which is equal to the Old National Market
Value on the Determination Date; or (y) the quotient determined by dividing
the Initial Old National Market Value by the Old National Market Value on the
Determination Date, and multiplying the quotient by the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.80. If within such five business
day period, Old National delivers written notice to Anchor that it intends to
proceed with the Merger by paying such additional consideration as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies Anchor of the revised
Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(g)_, and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms (except that the Exchange Ratio shall have been so
modified). For purposes of clarification, the adjustments to the Exchange
Ratio contemplated by _Section 1.5_ of this Agreement shall be calculated and
applied subsequent to any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(g)_. If Old National or any company belonging to the Index
declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the
date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for the common
stock of such company shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of
applying this _Section 8.1(g)_.

 



63 For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

 

(i) The " _Determination Date_ " means the first date on which all Requisite
Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) necessary for consummation
of the Merger have been received (disregarding any waiting period).

(ii) The " _Final Index Price_ " means the average of the daily closing value
of the Index, for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Determination Date.

 

(iii) The " _Index_ " means the NASDAQ Bank Index or, if such Index is not
available, such substitute or similar Index as substantially replicates the
NASDAQ Bank Index.

(iv) The " _Index Ratio_ " means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial
Index Price.

(v) The " _Initial Index Price_ " means the closing value of the Index on the
date of this Agreement.

(vi) The " _Initial Old National Market Value_ " means, $13.34, adjusted as
indicated in the last sentence of _Section 8.1(g)_.

(vii) The " _Old National Market Value_ " means, as of any specified date,
the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of Old National
Common Stock as reported on the Stock Exchange for the ten (10) consecutive
trading days immediately preceding such specified date.

 

(h) By Old National or Anchor, if Anchor shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Anchor Vote at the duly convened Anchor Meeting or at
any adjournment thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this _Section 8.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 9.5_, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Old National or
Anchor as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Old National, Anchor, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _
Sections 3.3(a)_, _3.7_ , _4.3(a)_ , _4.7_ , _6.3(b)_ and this _Section 8.2_
and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
Old National nor Anchor shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages arising out of its fraud or willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement (which

 



64  shall include the loss to shareholders of the economic benefits of the
Merger, including in the case of Anchor, the loss of the premium offered to
the shareholders of Anchor).

 

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management or the
Board of Directors of Anchor or shall have been made directly to its
shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and not
withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Anchor and (x) (A)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Old National or Anchor
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ without the Requisite Anchor Vote having been
obtained or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement was taken or (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by Old National pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, and (y) prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, Anchor
enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as
that referred to above), then Anchor shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Old National, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal
to $15,000,000 plus all of Old Nationals actual and reasonably documented out
of pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Old National and its Subsidiaries on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Old National Expenses_ ") (the $15,000,000 and the
Old National Expenses, collectively referred to as the " _Termination Fee_ ");
_provided_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)_, all references in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Old National pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(f)_, then Anchor shall pay Old National,
by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the business day
following the date of termination.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Old National or Anchor
pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ then Anchor shall pay Old National, by wire
transfer of same day funds, the Old National Expenses on the business day
following the date of termination

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
partys willful and material breach of any provision of the Agreement, the
maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by Anchor under this _Section 8.2_
shall be equal to the Termination Fee.

 

(d) Each of Old National and Anchor acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Anchor fails promptly to pay
the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Old National commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Anchor for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Anchor shall pay the
costs and expenses of Old National (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Anchor fails to
pay the amounts payable pursuant to

 



65  this _Section 8.2_, then Anchor shall pay interest on such overdue amounts
(for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue
amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate"
(as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on
the date on which such payment was required to be made for the period
commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to
be paid. The amounts payable by Anchor pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of
fraud or willful misconduct, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Old National
in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section.

9.10  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY

hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in _Section 6.8_, which is intended to benefit each
Anchor Indemnified Party and his or her heir and representatives, this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is
not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth

 



69  herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

9.13  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and
this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

This Voting Agreement, dated as of January 11, 2016 (this "Voting Agreement"),
