contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term &#147;Solvent&#148; when used with respect to any person, means that, as of any date of determination (a)&nbsp;the amount of the &#147;fair saleable value&#148; of the assets of such
person will, as of such date, exceed (i)&nbsp;the value of all &#147;liabilities of such person, including contingent and other liabilities,&#148; as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii)&nbsp;the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such person on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and

engaged&#148; and &#147;able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature&#148; means that such person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination
thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. </P>
