AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth in this Assignment, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

 

1\. _Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meaning prescribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

2\. _Assignment of the Assigned Interests_. From and after the Effective Date,
Assignor hereby (i) transfers, assigns, conveys and delivers to Assignee all
of such Assignors right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Interests
free and clear of all liens (other than restrictions on transfer which arise
under applicable securities laws and liens created in or by Assignor or any
of its affiliates) and (ii) simultaneously with such assignment, the Assignee
is hereby admitted to each limited liability company (" _LLC_ ") with respect
to the Assigned Interests as a member of each LLC, and (iii) immediately
after such admission, Assignor shall and does hereby cease to be a member of
each LLC with respect to the Assigned Interests and shall thereupon cease to
have or exercise any right or power as a member of such LLCs.

3\. _Assumption of the Assigned Interests_. From and after the Effective Date,
Assignee hereby accepts and assumes all of Assignors obligations and
liabilities, to the extent they arise or relate to periods following the
Effective Date, with respect to the Assigned Interests.

 

4\. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, NO PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED BY

shall constitute one and the same Assignment.

8\. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Assignment that
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable for any reason shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective
solely to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Assignment or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Assignment in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Assignment is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be so
broad as to be unenforceable, that provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of

the Southern District of New York for the purpose of any and all actions,
suits or proceedings arising in whole or in part out of, related to, based
upon or in connection with this Assignment or the subject matter hereof, (ii)
hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and agrees not
to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action,
any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution or
that any such action brought in one of the above-named courts should be
dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens, should be transferred to any
court other than one of the above-named courts or should be stayed by reason
of the pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other than one of
the above-named courts, or that this Assignment or the subject matter hereof
may not be enforced in or by such court and (iii) hereby agrees not to

 



2  commence any such action other than before one of the above-named courts nor
to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause the
transfer or removal of any such action to any court other than one of the
above-named courts whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise.
Each Party hereby (A) consents to service of process in any such action in any
manner permitted by New York law, (B) agrees that service of process made in
accordance with clause (A) or made by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, at its (or in the case of Assignor, Sellers) address
specified pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Purchase Agreement, shall
constitute good and valid service of process in any such action and (C) waives
and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise) in any
such action any claim that service of process made in accordance with clauses
(A) or (B) does not constitute good and valid service of process.

subject to and governed by the terms of the Purchase Agreement. To the extent
this Assignment conflicts with the Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement
will control.

Seller has all necessary power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to
carry out its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Seller, the performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder
and the consummation by Seller of the Closing have been duly authorized by all
requisite action on the part of Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Seller, and assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser, will constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect
that affect the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by equitable
limitations on the availability of specific remedies and by principles of
equity.

2\. _Title; Capitalization_.

 

(a) The Company or its applicable subsidiary, as applicable, is the record and
beneficial owner of the Purchased Interests, free and clear of all liens
(other than restrictions on transfer which arise under applicable securities
laws and liens created in or by Purchaser or any of its affiliates). The
Company or its applicable subsidiary is not a party to any option, warrant,
purchase right, right of first offer or first refusal or other Contract,
commitment or understanding that could require the Company or its applicable
subsidiary to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, or create any lien on,
any of the Purchased Interests.

(b) The Company or its applicable subsidiary is not a party to any voting
trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other Contract, commitment or
understanding in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of the
Purchased Interests.

(c) As of Closing, all of the Purchased Interests have been duly authorized,
validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable. Other than the Purchased
Interests, there are no other shares of capital stock, equity interests or
similar rights in the Purchased Subsidiaries authorized, issued or
outstanding.

(d) There are no outstanding options, restricted stock, warrants or other
similar instruments of any kind relating to the acquisition, transfer, sale,
issuance or voting of any securities (including any shares of capital stock of
any class or other voting securities or ownership interests) of the Purchases
Subsidiaries that have been issued, granted or entered into by the Purchased
Subsidiaries, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
evidencing the right to purchase from the Purchased Subsidiaries, any
securities of the Purchased Subsidiaries. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Purchased Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of their respective shares.

3\. Due Incorporation; Subsidiaries. Each of the Purchased Subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such
concepts are recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, and has all the necessary power and authority
to own, lease, operate and conduct its properties and businesses as they are
now being owned, leased, operated and conducted, except for such failures to
be in good standing or to have such requisite power or authority that would
not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Exhibit D

 

Representations and Warranties of Purchaser

 

1\. _Organization and Authority_. Purchaser is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are recognized in
the applicable jurisdiction) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation. Purchaser has all necessary power and authority to enter into this
Agreement, to carry out its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser, the performance by Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Purchaser of the Closing have been duly
authorized by all requisite action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser, and assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, will
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser,
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect that affect the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by equitable limitations on
the availability of specific remedies and by principles of equity.

2\. _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser has delivered to the Seller correct and complete copies of an
executed commitment letter among Terraform Power Operating, LLC, Goldman
Sachs Bank USA, Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated (including any related exhibits, schedules, annexes,
supplements and other related documents), each dated on or about the date of
this Agreement (as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from
time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this
Agreement, the "Debt Financing Commitments"), from each of the financing
sources identified therein (collectively, the "Debt Financing Sources"),
pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the amounts set
forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, the "Debt Financing"), together with a
customarily redacted fee letter from the Debt Financing Sources related to the
Debt Financing (the "Fee Letter").

 

(b) Except for the Fee Letter or as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or
other agreements, Contracts or written arrangements to which Purchaser or any
of its affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Debt Financing which could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the availability of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitments. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.01 (to the extent any such condition is a condition under the
control of the Seller) and Section 7.03, Purchaser does not have any reason
to believe, as of the date of this Agreement, that it or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates will be unable to satisfy all conditions to be
satisfied by it, its subsidiaries and its controlled affiliates with respect
to any of the Debt Financing Commitments at the time it, its subsidiaries and
its affiliates is required to consummate the Closing hereunder or that the
Debt Financing will not be available to Purchaser or its affiliates party
thereto at the Closing, including any reason to believe that any of the Debt
Financing Sources will not perform their respective funding obligations under
the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions. 

(c) As of the date hereof, there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions) related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitments, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with
the Debt Financing Commitments, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments, together with other financial resources of Purchaser,
whether directly held or available for use by Purchaser, and its controlled
affiliates including cash on hand and the proceeds of loans under existing
credit facilities of Purchaser or its controlled affiliates on the Closing
Date and funds that will be provided by controlled affiliates of Purchaser, in
the aggregate, shall provide Purchaser and Merger Sub with cash proceeds on  the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Purchasers and
Merger Subs payment obligations under this Agreement and under the Debt
Financing Commitments, including the payment of any amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Article II, any fees and expenses of or payable by Purchaser,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the
Debt Financing and any indebtedness required to be repaid, redeemed, retired,
canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in connection with the Merger
(including all indebtedness of the Seller and its subsidiaries required to be
repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in
connection with the Merger).

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and constitute valid and binding obligations of
Purchaser and any of its affiliates party thereto and, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, each other party thereto, enforceable in accordance with their
terms against Purchaser and any of its affiliates party thereto and, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, each other party thereto (except as such enforcement
may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating
to creditors rights generally, and general equitable principles) and, as of
the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part
of Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser or, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
any other party thereto under the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing
Commitments. Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing
Commitments and the Fee Letters on or before the date of this Agreement. As of
the date hereof, (i) none of the Debt Financing Commitments or Fee Letters
has been modified, amended or otherwise altered (and no such modification,
amendment or alteration is contemplated by Purchaser or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, any other party thereto) and (ii) none of the
respective commitments under any of the Debt Financing Commitments have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded (and no such withdrawal, termination or
recission is contemplated by Purchaser or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any
other party thereto).

 

(e) Purchaser is not entering into this Agreement or the Debt Financing
Commitment with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Purchasers
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the
payment of the Purchase Price to the Seller, payment of all amounts required
to be paid in connection with the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and expenses, Purchaser
will be Solvent as of the Closing Date and immediately after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any person, means that, as of any
date of determination (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all
"liabilities of such person, including contingent and other liabilities," as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with
applicable laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and
(ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such
person on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as
such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such person will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date, and (c) such person will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this
definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due. Exhibit E
