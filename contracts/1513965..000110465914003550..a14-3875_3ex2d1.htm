 **ARTICLE 1**

 

 **PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the

and consummation of the sale of the Purchased Assets (collectively, the "
_Records_ "); _provided, however,_ that each Seller may retain copies of the
Records as may be necessary for litigation, tax, accounting or auditing
purposes or as otherwise may be required by applicable Laws and Regulations.

 



 

1.2 _No Other Assets_. Except for the Purchased Assets expressly described in
Section 1.1 above, Sellers shall not sell, and Buyer shall not purchase, any
other assets, properties, interests or rights of Sellers.

 



 

1.3 _Assumed Liabilities_. As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume all
liabilities, duties, obligations and responsibilities of every kind whatsoever
attributable to the Purchased Assets, whether known or unknown, whether
attributable to the period of time before or after the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2**

 

 **PURCHASE PRICE**

 



 

2.1 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ")
for the Purchased Assets shall be (a) One Hundred Million Dollars
($100,000,000) (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "), _plus_ (b) the amount, if any,
of all capital costs and expenses in respect of the Purchased Assets paid by
Sellers prior to the date upon which the Proposed Final Settlement Statement
is due to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and either (i) incurred after
October 1, 2013 (the " _Capital_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Date_ ") and prior to the date hereof as set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ or (ii)
incurred between the date hereof and the Closing Date in accordance with
Section 5.3(c)(vii) ((i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Capital Adjustment_ "),
_minus_ (c) the amount, if any, of all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer to
create "as-built" maps for the Purchased Assets as set forth on _Schedule
2.1_.

 



 

2.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_. As soon as practicable but no later than 90
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers an allocation of
the Base Purchase Price (and all other capitalizable costs) among the
Purchased Assets (the " _Initial Allocation_ " and any revision thereto as
provided hereunder, the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Upon any adjustment
to the Base Purchase Price or the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or upon any Assumed Liability that was contingent becoming
fixed and ascertainable, capitalizable costs becoming fixed and ascertainable,
or any purchase price adjustment due to indemnification, Buyer shall deliver
to Sellers a proposed revision to the Purchase Price Allocation then in
effect, which shall be consistent with the methodology used to prepare the
Initial Allocation. Upon (i) Buyers delivery of the Initial Allocation or
(ii) Buyers delivery of any proposed revision, Sellers shall have 10 business
days to object to such proposed purchase price allocation. If the Sellers do
not timely object, the proposed purchase price allocation shall become the
Purchase Price Allocation. If the Sellers do timely object, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such objection promptly; _provided,
however,_ that, if the Parties fail to agree on a new Purchase Price
Allocation within 30 days of Buyers notice of proposed revision, either Party
may refer the proposed revision and the objection to Deloitte and Touche LLP
(the " _Audit Firm_ ") and the resolution by such firm shall become the
Purchase Price Allocation. The Parties shall each report the federal, state
and local income and other tax consequences of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (which for such purposes includes the Transaction Documents
(as defined in Section 3.4 below)) in a manner consistent with the Purchase
Price Allocation, including the preparation and filing of Form 8594 under
Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any
successor form or successor provision of any future tax law, or any comparable
provision of state or local tax law), with respect to their respective
federal, state and local income tax returns for the taxable year that includes
the Closing Date and shall not take any position contrary thereto in
connection with any amended return.

 



 

2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) No later than three days prior to the Closing, the Seller Representative
(as defined in Section 9.1(a) below) shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
preliminary settlement statement prepared by the Seller Representative in
accordance with this Agreement and generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied by Seller (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ "),
which sets forth the Seller Representatives good faith estimate of the
Capital Adjustment.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable but no later than 90 days after the Closing, the
Seller Representative shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement in the
same form of and on the same basis as the Preliminary Settlement Statement
(the " _Proposed Final Settlement Statement_ "), which sets forth the Seller
Representatives calculation of the final Purchase Price and each adjustment
or payment that was not finally determined on the Preliminary Settlement
Statement. Each Party shall, during normal business hours, grant and provide
the other Party access to the Purchased Records in the possession or control
of such Party for the purposes of

 



      
 

 



 

conducting an audit of the information set forth in the Proposed Final
Settlement Statement.

 



 

(c) Within 30 days following receipt by Buyer of the Proposed Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer shall, if applicable, provide the Seller Representative with
a written objection (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") detailing Buyers
objections, if any, to the Seller Representatives calculation of the final
Purchase Price. To the extent such written notice is not delivered by Buyer
within such time period, the Seller Representatives calculation of the final
Purchase Price, and each component thereof, shall become final and binding
upon the Parties.

 



 

(d) Any disagreement between Buyer and Sellers regarding the Seller
Representatives calculation of the final Purchase Price that cannot be
resolved within 30 days after the date of the Notice of Disagreement shall be
resolved by Audit Firm, who shall calculate the final Purchase Price in a
manner consistent with the Preliminary Settlement Statement and this Agreement
in all respects. Sellers and Buyer shall each have an opportunity to present
its position to the Audit Firm and shall cooperate with the Audit Firm in
making available to it any records or work papers requested by the Audit Firm.
The determination of the Audit Firm shall be expressly limited to the
determination of the final Purchase Price, and the Audit Firm will not render
any decision or have any authority to render a decision with respect to any
other matter relating to this Agreement, including with respect to any alleged
breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by any Party. In making such
determination, the Audit Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in
the Proposed Final Settlement Statement with which Buyer has disagreed and
which are set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. In no event shall the final
Purchase Price as determined by the Audit Firm be more favorable to Sellers
than reflected on the Proposed Final Settlement Statement by the Seller
Representative nor more favorable to Buyer than shown in the proposed changes
set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Audit Firm to render its decision
within 15 business days after such points of disagreement are submitted to the
Audit Firm. Subject to the provisions set forth in this Section 2.3(d), the
decision of the Audit Firm shall be set forth in writing and shall be
conclusive and binding on the Parties and subject to judicial enforcement. The
fees charged by the Audit Firm shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers,
and each Party shall bear all of its own costs and expenses associated with
the submission of any disputed matters to the Audit Firm.

 



 

(e) If the final Purchase Price, as determined pursuant to this Section 2.3,
exceeds (i) the Base Purchase Price, _plus_ (ii) the Seller Representatives
good faith estimate of the Capital Adjustment (the " _Closing Payment_ "),
then Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess. If the final
Purchase Price, as determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, is less than the
Closing Payment, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of such
deficiency. Any payment shall be made within three days after the date the
final Purchase Price is deemed to be finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.4 via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated in writing by the Party entitled to such payment.

 



 

2.4 _Payment of Closing Payment_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to each
Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share of the Closing Payment in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s) designated by such
Seller. " _Pro Rata Share_ " means, with respect to each Seller, the
percentage set forth next to such Sellers name on _Schedule 2.4_.

 



      
 

 



 

2.5 _Revenues and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) Sellers shall bear all (A)
operating expenses which are incurred in respect of the ownership,
maintenance, use or operation of the Purchased Assets before the Effective
Time and (B) capital expenses which are incurred in respect of the ownership,
maintenance, use or operation of the Purchased Assets before the Capital Date
(the " _Seller Expenses_ "), (ii) Sellers shall be entitled to receive all
proceeds collectible in respect of the ownership, use or operation of the
Purchased Assets attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Pre-Closing Revenues_ "), (iii) Buyer shall bear all (A) operating expenses
which are incurred in respect of the ownership, maintenance, use or operation
of the Purchased Assets after the Effective Time and (B) capital expenses
which are incurred in respect of the ownership, maintenance, use or operation
of the Purchased Assets after the Capital Date (the " _Buyer Expenses_ ") and
(iv) Buyer shall be entitled to receive all proceeds in respect of the
ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Assets attributable to the period
after the Effective Time (the " _Post-Closing Revenues_ ").

 



 

(b) In the event that Buyer pays any Seller Expenses, Sellers shall promptly
reimburse Buyer for the amount of Seller Expenses paid by Buyer. In the event
that Sellers receive any invoice or other statement relating to Buyer
Expenses, Sellers shall promptly forward such invoice or statement to Buyer.

 



 

(c) Promptly following the Closing, Sellers shall irrevocably authorize,
instruct and direct all account parties to the Contracts from whom Post-
Closing Revenues are or may be owed to Buyer to make and deliver all payments
relating thereto on or after the Closing Date to such location, bank and
account as Buyer shall specify. In the event that any Seller or any of its
Affiliates receives any Post-Closing Revenues, Sellers shall promptly deliver
all such Post-Closing Revenues to Buyer. In the event that Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receives any Pre-Closing Revenues, Buyer shall promptly deliver all
such Pre-Closing Revenues to Sellers.

(a) _Organization and Good Standing_. Such Seller is (i) a limited partnership
or limited liability company validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Texas or (ii) an individual. Such Seller has all
requisite limited partnership, personal or limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease and operate the Purchased Assets and conduct its
business as and where currently being conducted.

 



 

(b) _Authorization and Enforceability_. Such Seller has the requisite limited
partnership, personal or limited liability company power and authority to

been duly and validly authorized by all necessary limited partnership,
personal or limited liability company action on the part of such Seller. This
Agreement has been, and the other Seller Transaction Documents will be, duly
and validly executed and delivered by such Seller. This Agreement is, and the
other Seller Transaction Documents will be, the legal, valid and binding
obligations of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with
their respective terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and except to the extent that general
equitable principles may affect the availability of certain remedies.

 



 

(c) _No Violation of Laws or Agreements_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.1(c)_ , the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
other Seller Transaction Documents by such Seller do not, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the compliance by such
Seller with any of the provisions hereof and thereof will not, conflict with,
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) under, give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of any Lien (as defined in Section 4.1(d) below) on any
of the Purchased Assets under, any provision of (i) the organizational
documents of such Seller (if not an individual), (ii) any loan or

 



      
 

 



 

credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, lease, permit,
concession, franchise, license or other agreement or instrument applicable to
such Seller or the Purchased Assets (other than any Right of Way or Contract)
or (iii) any Laws and Regulations applicable to such Seller or the Purchased
Assets, except, in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, any event, occurrence
or condition shall have a " _Material Adverse Effect_ " if such event,
occurrence or condition, either individually or together with all other
events, occurrences or conditions, (1) has a material adverse effect on the
ownership, use, operation or value of the Purchased Assets, taking into
account the nature and valuation of the Purchased Assets or (2) materially
hinders or impedes the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except to the extent resulting from or arising in connection with
(i) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the public
announcement thereof; (ii) changes, circumstances or effects (A) that affect

oil and gas industry, (3) changes in applicable Laws and Regulations or the
application or interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority enacted,
promulgated or issued on or after the date hereof or (4) other general
economic conditions, facts or circumstances that are not subject to the
reasonable control of the Parties; (iii) effects of conditions or events
resulting from an outbreak or escalation of hostilities (whether nationally or
internationally), or the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis (whether
nationally or internationally), including the occurrence of one or more
terrorist attacks; or (iv) any action taken at the written request, or with
the written approval, of the Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the changes,
circumstances or effects set forth in (2)(ii)(A) and (B) above shall be deemed
to have a Material Adverse Effect to the extent such changes, circumstances or
effects disproportionately impact the Purchased Assets compared with the oil
and gas industry generally or international, national, regional, state or
local economic conditions, as applicable.

 



 

(d) _Title to Purchased Assets_. Such Seller owns the Purchased Assets free
and clear of all liens, mortgages, security interests, pledges, claims,
charges, options or other encumbrances substantially equivalent thereto

directly or indirectly have any responsibility, liability or expense as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.2 _Representations and Warranties of Sellers_. Each Seller, jointly and
severally, represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof and as of
the Closing Date that:

 



 

(a) _No Violation of Laws or Agreements_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Seller Transaction Documents by
any Seller does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and the compliance by any Seller with any of the provisions
hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, result in any violation of or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, give rise to
a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien on
any of the Purchased Assets under, any provision of any Right of Way or
Contract (except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2(b)_ ), except for any such
conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Approvals and Consents_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(c)_ or

_Governmental Authority_ ") or any person or entity is required in connection
with the execution or performance of this Agreement or the other Seller
Transaction Documents by any Seller or the consummation by any Seller of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for consents or approvals
of, or notices to, any Governmental Authority that are customarily obtained or
given after closing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the " _Customary Post-Closing Consents_ "), and (ii) no
Purchased Asset is subject to any preferential right to purchase, right of

Authority; _provided, however,_ that, if the taxes for 2014 are thereafter

assessed valuation thereof is concluded), Buyer and Sellers promptly shall
adjust the proration of such taxes based on actual taxes paid with respect to

amount required as a result of such adjustment. The portion of such taxes

reimbursed because of such proration, the other Party responsible therefor
shall promptly reimburse the party so paying upon notice of the amount paid by

may result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) No Seller shall take or omit to take any action outside of the ordinary

unless required by applicable Laws and Regulations.

 



 

5.9 _Transaction Expenses_. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein,

Assets (whether in the possession of Sellers or Buyer). No files, books or
records existing at the Closing Date and relating in any manner to the
Purchased Assets shall be destroyed by any Party for a period of two years

this Section 5.10 shall be during normal business hours and upon not less than
two days prior written

custody or control thereof may impose to preserve the confidentiality of
information contained therein, and shall not extend to material subject to a
claim of privilege unless expressly waived by the Party entitled to claim the
same.

 



 

5.11 _Confidentiality_. The respective obligations of the Parties with regard
to the use and disclosure of information provided to one Party by the other

L.P. (" _AMID_ "), an Affiliate of Buyer. Notwithstanding anything in the
Confidentiality Agreement or this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers and Buyer
shall consult with each other with regard to all publicity and other public

the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1 or Section 4.2
above do not provide for Schedules, reflecting events or changes in
circumstances occurring after the date of this Agreement. Prior to the

Agreement (but in any event within three business days of this date of this
Agreement), Sellers and Buyer shall in a timely manner (a) make all required
filings, if any, with and prepare applications to and conduct negotiations
with each Governmental Authority as to which such filings, applications or
negotiations are necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, specifically including, but not
limited to, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (b) provide such information as each may
reasonably request to make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct
such negotiations and (c) request early termination or waiver of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. To the extent reasonably
practicable, Sellers and Buyer shall each have the right to review in advance
all information relating to such Party that is disclosed for any filing. Each
Party shall cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the other with respect to such filings, applications and negotiations
and shall promptly furnish each other with copies of any written
communications delivered to such Party from any Governmental Authority. The
applicable filing fee in connection with the filings to be made under the HSR
Act shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers.

 



 

5.16 _Further Assurances_. At or after the Closing, any Party, at the request
of any other Party and without additional consideration, shall execute and
deliver to the requesting Party all such further assignments, deeds,
agreements, contracts, instruments and other documents as the requesting Party
may reasonably request in order to perform, accomplish, perfect or record, if
reasonably necessary, the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery to Buyer of
the Purchased Assets as contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain the
Customary Post-Closing Consents and to otherwise carry out the intention of
this Agreement.

 



 

5.17 _Financial Information_. Sellers hereby agree to provide to Buyer access
to such records, materials and documents in Sellers possession as may be
reasonably requested from time to time by Buyer and its auditors in connection

already recorded) all of the Rights of Way set forth on _Schedule 1.1(b)_.

 



 

5.19 _Replacement of Drip Tanks_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the drip
tanks currently used to operate the Gathering Assets are not Purchased Assets
and, consequently, Buyer will need to procure and install new drip tanks for
the operation of the Gathering Assets following the Closing. Buyer shall
procure and install such new drip tanks within 90 days following the Closing
Date. During such 90-day period, Sellers shall allow Buyer to continue to use
Sellers existing drip tanks in connection with the operation of the Gathering
Assets. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages arising out of or
relating to Buyers use of Sellers existing drip tanks, even if caused in
whole or in part by the negligence (whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict
liability or other legal fault of any Seller Indemnified Parties (but
excluding gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any Seller
Indemnified Parties).

7.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under this
Agreement related to Third Party Claims shall be asserted and resolved
pursuant to this Section 7.4.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Person seeking indemnification hereunder
(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of a notice of any Proceeding by any third party
that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Third Party Claim to
the indemnifying Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") stating the nature and
basis of the Third Party Claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known,
along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing the Third Party Claim
and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on
account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, shall have the right,
exercisable within 30 days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, to
assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim so
long as (i) the Indemnifying Party proceeds in good faith and in a timely
manner and (ii) such Third Party Claim involves (and continues to involve)
solely monetary damages.

 



 

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.4(b) above, (i) the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all costs and expenses of counsel for the
Indemnified Party (A) for all periods prior to such time as the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party that it has assumed the defense of
such Third Party Claim and (B) if there is a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(d) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Damages
from Third Party Claims and shall act in good faith and in a timely manner in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third
Party Claims. The Parties shall also cooperate in any such defense and give
each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to

 



      
 

 



 

settle any Third Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems
reasonably appropriate, to the extent such claim involves equitable or other
non-monetary relief.

 



 

7.5 _Other Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) No Party shall have any liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section
7.3(a) above with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty
(other than any Fundamental Representation) unless and until the aggregate
amount of all of the Damages to the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds
$2,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), in which case the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent of
the excess over the Indemnification Threshold. There shall be no threshold or
deductible with respect to (i) Sellers obligations to Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.2(a) above with respect to any breach of any Fundamental
Representation or pursuant to Section 7.2(b) above or (ii) Buyers obligations
to Sellers pursuant to Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.3(c).

 



 

(b) The aggregate liability of any Party pursuant to this Article 7 shall in
no event exceed, individually or in the aggregate, $15,000,000; _provided,
however,_ that subject to Section 7.5(c) below, (a) Buyers liability pursuant
to Section 7.3(b) above with respect to any covenant (including Buyers
liability to fund the Purchase Price at the Closing) and Section 7.3(c) and
(b) Sellers liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a) with respect to any
Fundamental Representation and Section 7.2(b) with respect to any covenant,
shall, in each case, be without limit.

 



 

(c) Under no circumstances shall any Party be liable to any other Party for
any indirect, contingent, consequential, unforeseen, exemplary or punitive,
special Damages of any nature (including lost profits); _provided, however,_
that any such Damages recovered by any third party for which a Party owes
another Party an indemnity under this Agreement shall not be waived.

 



 

(d) The Parties will make appropriate adjustments for any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party in determining Damages for purposes
of this Article 7. All indemnification payments under this Article 7 will be
deemed to be adjustments to the amounts paid to Sellers pursuant to Article 2.
Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(e) Each Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages that it asserts under
this Article 7, but any reasonable costs and expenses (other than internal
costs and expenses) incurred in connection therewith shall constitute Damages.

 



 

7.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD, AFTER THE CLOSING THE RIGHT
OF THE PARTIES TO ASSERT INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND RECEIVE INDEMNITY PAYMENTS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY EXERCISABLE BY
THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH BY ANY PARTY
OF ANY

 



      
 

 



 

REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT OF SUCH PARTY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. NO
PARTY WILL HAVE ANY OTHER REMEDY (STATUTORY, EQUITABLE, COMMON LAW OR
OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH MATTERS, AND ALL SUCH
OTHER REMEDIES ARE HEREBY WAIVED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN THE
ABSENCE OF FRAUD, EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SUCH PARTY
WILL NOT HAVE ANY REMEDY AFTER THE CLOSING FOR ANY BREACH OF ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 7.

 



 

7.7 _Tax Treatment_. Indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article 7
may be treated as adjustments of the Purchase Price as permitted by applicable
Laws and Regulations.

no event later than 30 days after resignation of the Seller Representative or
successor Seller Representative, as applicable), and the Parties shall
thereafter be notified in writing of such designation; _provided, however,_
that the Parties agree that a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in
Harris County, Texas shall have the authority to appoint a successor Seller
Representative in the event that a successor Seller Representative is not
designated within the 30-day period pursuant to the provisions hereof.

 



 

(d) The Seller Representative shall have no duties except those which are
expressly set forth herein. Each Seller hereby consents and agrees to all

severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative from and
against all Damages incurred in connection with the performance of its duties
under this Agreement, excluding such Damages caused by the gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct of the Seller Representative. The Seller
Representative shall be entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off
and deduct any such unpaid, unsatisfied Damages from any amounts owed to a
Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the Seller Representative
shall not be liable, responsible or accountable in Damages or otherwise to any
Party by reason of, arising from or relating to any action taken or failure to

faith upon the records of Sellers and upon such information, opinions, reports
or statements presented to the Seller Representative by any of its
accountants, consultants, brokers, financial advisors, legal counsel and other
professionals as to matters the Seller Representative reasonably believes are
within such Persons professional or expert competence.

 



 

(g) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF
ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE SELLERS
REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, UNLESS CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE, BAD
FAITH OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE.

 



 

(h) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, EACH SELLER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES
THAT INDEMNIFICATION PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 9.1 SHALL INCLUDE
INDEMNIFICATION FOR THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVES OWN NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER
THEORIES OF STRICT LIABILITY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BUT SHALL
EXCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION FOR THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVES GROSS NEGLIGENCE, BAD
FAITH OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

 



 

(i) The provisions set forth in this Section 9.1 shall survive the resignation
of the Seller Representative and the termination of this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that the authorizations of the Seller Representative shall be
effective only until its rights and obligations under this Agreement terminate
by virtue of the termination of any and all obligations of Sellers and of
Buyer under this Agreement.

 



 

(j) The appointment and grant of power and authority by each Seller under this
Section 9.1 is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and shall not be
terminated by any act of such Party or by operation of law, whether by the
death or incapacity of such Party or by the occurrence of any other event.

existing or hereafter discovered, at law, in equity or otherwise,

 



      
 

 



 

whether arising by statute, common law, in contract, in tort or otherwise,

other Party; (iii) waive compliance by the other Party with any of the
covenants or agreements contained herein and performance of any obligations by
the other Party; and (iv) waive the fulfillment of any condition that is
precedent to the performance by such Party of any of its obligations under
this Agreement. To be effective, any such extension or waiver must be in
writing and be signed by the Party providing such waiver or extension, as the
case may be. No such extension or waiver by any Party, nor any waiver by any
Party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement, shall operate or be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach, whether or not similar. No
failure or any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents shall operate
as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or privilege shall preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not
alternative.

 



 

10.2 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that no Party may
assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement without the consent of the other Party. Any transfer or
assignment in violation of this Section 10.2 shall be void _ab initio_.

 



 

10.3 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and communications required or
permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing, and any communication or

Any Party may, by written notice so delivered to the other Parties, change the
address or individual to which delivery shall thereafter be made. If any Party
rejects or otherwise refuses to accept a notice, or if the notice cannot be
delivered because of a change in address for which no notice was given to the
Party attempting to give or make such notice, such notice shall be deemed to
have been received upon such rejection, refusal or such inability to deliver.

 



 

10.4 _Severability_. The Parties agree that (i) the provisions of this
Agreement shall be severable in the event that any provision hereof is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise
unenforceable, (ii) such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provision
shall be automatically replaced by another provision which is as similar as
possible in terms to such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provision
but which is valid and enforceable and (iii) the remaining provisions shall
remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 



 

10.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall (i) confer on any person or entity other than
the Parties (and the Indemnified Parties referred to in Article 7 above) and
their respective successors or assigns any rights (including third party
beneficiary rights), remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement, or (ii) constitute the Parties as partners or as
participants in a joint venture. This Agreement shall not provide third
parties with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or
other right in excess of those existing without reference to the terms of this
Agreement. No third party shall have any right, independent of any right which
may exist irrespective of this Agreement, under or granted by this Agreement,
to bring any suit at law or equity for any matter governed by or subject to
the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

10.6 _Construction_. Buyer and Sellers have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. In
the event that any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by Buyer and Sellers, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

 



 

10.7 _References and Titles_. All references to cash or monetary amounts refer
to U.S. Dollars only unless specifically stated to be in the currency of
another government. The words " _this Agreement_ ," " _herein_ ," " _hereby_
," " _hereunder_ " and " _hereof_ ," and words of similar import, refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision, unless
expressly so limited. The words " _this Article_ ," " _this Section"_ and "
_this subsection_ ," and words of similar import, refer only to the Articles,
Sections or subsections, respectively, hereof in which such

 



      
 

 



 

words occur. The word " _including_ " (in its various forms) means "
_including without limitation_." Any reference to any federal, state or local
statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. Pronouns in
masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include
any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein)
in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice versa,
unless the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the context otherwise
requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include the singular and
plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such defined terms.

 



 

10.8 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All exhibits and schedules annexed hereto or
referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein.

 



 

10.9 _Headings_. The headings preceding the text of the articles, sections and
paragraphs hereof are inserted solely for convenience of reference and shall
not constitute a part of this Agreement nor shall they affect its meaning,
construction or effect.

 



 

10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any executed counterpart
delivered by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission shall be
deemed an original for all purposes.

 



 

10.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the exhibits and
schedules attached hereto and the other Transaction Documents, and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire understanding of the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior negotiations,
discussions, agreements or understandings, written or oral, between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

10.12 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the Laws and Regulations of the State of Texas,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws and Regulations of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Texas.

 



 

10.13 _Several Obligations of Sellers_. Except as provided in Section 7.2, the
obligations of each Seller under or arising out of this Agreement are several
and not joint. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any
representation, warranty or covenant of a Seller contained in this Agreement
(other than the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2) is
made by such Seller only with respect to itself and its own interest in the
Purchased Assets and such Seller shall not be liable for any breach (or
Damages arising out of a breach) by another Seller of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement (other
than the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2).

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11**

 

 **GUARANTEE**

 



 

Buyer Guarantor shall cause payment of all amounts owed by Buyer to Sellers
pursuant to Article 2 hereunder if, as and when provided in this Agreement. In
no event shall Buyer Guarantor have any greater liability than Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by
their respective duly authorized officers as of the date first written above.

 ** _EXHIBIT B_**

 



 

 **MEMBERSHIP** **INTEREST**

 

 **ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT is executed by ArcLight Energy
Partners Fund V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Assignor_ ");
American Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Assignee_
"); and HPIP Lavaca, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Company_ "), as of the [*] day of January, 2014 (the " _Effective Date_ ").

 



 

 ** _RECITALS_**

 



 

Assignor agreed to that certain Limited Liability Company Agreement of the
Company (the " _Company Agreement_ ") as of November 26, 2013;

 



 

Assignor is the sole member of the Company and owns 100% of the limited
liability company units in the Company (the " _Interest_ "); and

 



 

Assignor wishes to transfer the Interest in the Company, and assign all of its
rights in or connected with the Interest to Assignee.

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENT_**

 



 

In consideration of the foregoing Recitals (which are incorporated herein by
this reference), and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** ** ****Transfer; Admission as Member.** Assignor hereby grants,
assigns and transfers the Interest as a Member (as defined in the Company
Agreement) of the Company and all of its rights, title and interests in or
connected with the Interest (the " _Transfer_ ") to Assignee. Upon the
Transfer, Assignee shall be admitted as the sole Member of the Company
replacing Assignor as the Member, and shall own all of the interests in the
profits, losses and capital of the Company previously owned by Assignor.
Assignee hereby adopts the Company Agreement as the operating agreement of the
Company upon the Transfer.

 



 

 **2.** ** ****Representations and Warranties of Assignor**. Assignor
represents and warrants, to and for the benefit of Assignee and the Company,
as follows:

 



 

(a) Assignor has full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and all agreements, instruments and documents
contemplated hereby, and all actions of Assignor necessary for such execution,
delivery and performance have been duly taken.

 



 

(b) This Agreement, when executed and delivered, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Assignor, and, upon due execution and delivery by the parties
thereto, all agreements, instruments and documents to be executed by Assignor
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will be legal, valid
and binding obligations of Assignor, each

      
 

 



 

enforceable against Assignor in accordance with its respective terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and subject to general equity principles and to limitations on
availability of equitable relief, including specific performance.

 



 

(c) Assignor is the owner, beneficially and of record, of the interests being
transferred hereby, free and clear of any liens, encumbrances, security
agreements, equities, options, claims, charges or restrictions, and effective
with the Transfer, Assignors entire right, title and interest in and to such
interests shall have been conveyed.

 



 

(d) The execution, delivery, and performance of and compliance with this
Agreement by Assignor and the Transfer pursuant hereto, will not violate any
contract or agreement to which either Assignor is a party or by which Assignor
is bound.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by, enforced
in accordance with, and interpreted under, the Laws of the State of Colorado
without reference to conflicts of laws principles except for matters
concerning real property which shall be governed by, enforced in accordance
with, and interpreted under the Laws of the State in which the real property
is located.

 



 

 **4.** ** ****Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to
be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if
the rights or obligations of any party will not be materially and adversely
affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this
Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not
be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its
severance from this Agreement and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid, and enforceable provision as similar in terms to
such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be reasonably
possible so that the contemplated transactions may be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 **5.** ** ****No Waiver.** The failure in any one or more instances of a
party to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of this Agreement, to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement
conferred, or to waive any breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of this Agreement, shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such
terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the same shall
continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or
waiver had occurred. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and
signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.

 



 

 **6.** ** ****Multiple Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. In addition, the
parties may execute this Agreement and furnish copies of their signatures by
facsimile or other electronic transmission, each of which shall be as
effective as an originally delivered signature.

      
 

 



 

 **7.** ** ****Survival.** Notwithstanding any subsequent amendment to the
Company Agreement, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

 



 

 **8.** ** ****Acceptance of Company Agreement.** Assignee agrees to be bound
by the terms of the Company Agreement from and after the Effective Date.

      
 

 



 

The parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the Effective Date.
