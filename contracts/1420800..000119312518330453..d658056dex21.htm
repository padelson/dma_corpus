19

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any Company Common
Stockholder who is entitled to demand, and properly demands, appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Company Common Stock Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)(iii)_, but instead such holder
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares from the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At
the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall, prior to the judicial
appraisal determination, waive or withdraw their appraisal demand, or shall
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease
and each such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Company
Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in _Section
3.1(a)(iii)_. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands for appraisal, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(e) As set forth in _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.6_, with respect to the
Company Optionholders and Company RSU Holders, amounts owing to such holders
will be paid to the Surviving Corporation, which shall remit to them the
relevant amounts to which such holders are entitled through the Companys
regular payroll system.

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall
mail or cause to be mailed or otherwise delivered to each Company Common
Stockholder a Letter of Transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_
attached hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall include the obligation of each Company Common Stockholder to
agree to _Section 10.15_ of this Agreement, together with any notice required
pursuant to Section 262\. Upon the delivery of any duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, each such Company Common Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company Common Stock
Merger Consideration in respect of its, his or her shares of Company Common
Stock.

 

(b) Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company shall act, at Parents expense,
as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in effecting the exchanges of
Company Common Stock provided for herein pursuant to the Paying Agent
Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Paying Agent Agreement_ "). Following the delivery of a duly executed

 



20

    

 and completed Letter of Transmittal, each Company Common Stockholder shall
receive from the Paying Agent, in exchange for each share of Company Common
Stock such Company Common Stockholder holds, by wire transfer of same day
funds (or, in the absence of wire transfer instructions, by check) (i) on the
Closing Date (if such Company Common Stockholder has delivered such duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date) or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the
Per Share Portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration, (ii) the Per Share
Portion of the Remaining Amount, if any, at the time of its
distribution pursuant to _Section 3.6_ (after taking into account the
payment of any Securityholder Representative Costs and Expenses) and (iii) the
Per Share Portion of the Excess Amount, if any, at the time of its
distribution pursuant to  _Section 3.6_ (after taking into account the
payment of any Securityholder Representative Costs and Expenses).

the product of (x) the Per Share Portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration
_multiplied by_ (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Specified Shares) held by such Company Common Stockholder; _provided_ , in
the case of the portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration allocable to
Grand Slam Holdings, LLC, Grand Slam Holdings, LLC may direct (no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) Parent to pay such portion
directly to Grand Slam Holdings, LLC, in which case such portion shall not be
paid to the Paying Agent;

 

(ii) pay, or cause to be paid, to the Surviving Corporation (i) on behalf of
and as agent of the applicable Company Optionholders, the portion of the

its Subsidiaries, the Company shall pay, or Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay, the Company Transaction Expenses in accordance with wire

the Closing Date) by each payee thereof.

 

Section 3.5 _Funded Indebtedness_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent

Section 3.6 _Post-Closing Determination of Merger Consideration Adjustment;

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Securityholder Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth Parents good faith calculation of the Companys Working
Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses, in each
case, as of the Adjustment Time together with reasonable supporting detail of
each of the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement. The Closing
Statement, and the calculations contained therein, shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with the Company Accounting Principles.

 



22

    

(b) During the 45 days immediately following the Securityholder
Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "),
the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives shall be permitted
at reasonable times to review the books and records of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the working papers of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, and the independent accountants, if any, relating to
the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Working
Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses therein,
as well as the relevant books and records of the Company and Parent, and shall
be provided with reasonable access to the current and former personnel and
advisers of Parent and the Surviving Corporation who were involved in the
preparation of the Closing Statement in order to ask questions and receive
answers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the Securityholder Representative unless and
until the Securityholder Representative has signed a customary confidentiality
and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. The
Securityholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Review Period if the
Securityholder Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement or the
Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash or Company Transaction Expenses set
forth therein. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the Securityholder
Representatives determination of the amount of the Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, as of the
Adjustment Time with reasonably detailed supporting documentation.

(c) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement (the " _Dispute Resolution Period_ "), the Securityholder
Representative and Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement
that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement. If no Notice of Disagreement is received by Parent on or prior
to the expiration date of the Review Period, then the Closing Statement and
the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction
Expenses set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have
been accepted by the Securityholder Representative and shall become final and
binding upon Parent and the Equity Holders. If the parties cannot agree on the
Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses
during the Dispute Resolution Period, the Working Capital, Funded
Indebtedness, Cash or Company Transaction Expenses, in each case solely to the
extent not agreed between the Securityholder Representative and Parent, shall
be submitted to a boutique specialty firm with an active practice area
focused on post-mergers and acquisitions purchase price dispute resolution, in
either case, mutually agreed by Parent and the Securityholder Representative
in good faith or, in the absence of such agreement within five days after the
end of the Dispute Resolution Period, as selected by lot from up to three
firms proposed by each of the Securityholder Representative and Parent (the "
_Independent Arbitrator_ "). The Securityholder Representative and Parent
shall each enter into a customary engagement letter with the Independent
Arbitrator. The Securityholder Representative and Parent shall furnish the
Independent Arbitrator with a statement setting forth the items from the
Notice of Disagreement which are still in dispute (the " _Independent
Arbitrator Dispute Notice_ ") and the position, including the specific amount
proposed, of each of the Securityholder Representative and Parent with respect
to each such disputed item. Within 60 Business Days after the submission of
such matters to the Independent Arbitrator, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Independent Arbitrator, acting as an arbitrator and not as an
expert, 

 



23

    

 will, applying the Company Accounting Principles and the provisions of this
Agreement, based on information known or knowable as of the Closing Date to
the extent provided by the Parties, make a determination of the appropriate
amount of each of the line items in the Closing Statement as to which there is
disagreement as specified in the Independent Arbitrator Dispute Notice, which
determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Securityholder
Representative and Parent, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error. With
respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance
with the position of either the Securityholder Representative or Parent, shall
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts
advocated by the Securityholder Representative or Parent in the Independent
Arbitrator Dispute Notice with respect to such disputed line item (and Parent
shall not advocate any positions more adverse to the Equity Holders than the
amounts reflected in the Closing Statement). With respect to each disputed
line item, the difference between the respective positions will be divided
into three equal segments. If the Independent Arbitrators determination of
the appropriate amount for such line item is within a segment closer to one of
the advocated positions, such closer advocated position will be deemed to be
the appropriate amount. If the Independent Arbitrators determination of the
appropriate amount for such line item is in the middle segment, the
Independent Arbitrators determination in this regard will be adopted. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Independent Arbitrator shall not review any line
items or make any determination with respect to any matter other than those
matters in the Independent Arbitrator Dispute Notice that are in dispute. The
statement of each of Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and
Company Transaction Expenses as of the Adjustment Time and the determination
of the Working Capital, Funded Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction
Expenses therefrom that are final, conclusive and binding on the Equity
Holders, the Securityholder Representative and Parent, as determined either
through agreement of the Securityholder Representative and Parent (deemed or
otherwise) or through the determination of the Independent Arbitrator pursuant
to this _Section 3.6(c)_ are referred to herein as the " _Final Working
Capital Amount_ ," " _Final Funded Indebtedness_ ," " _Final Cash_ " and "
_Final Company Transaction Expenses_ ", respectively. For the avoidance of
doubt, the exclusion or inclusion of an item in the calculation of the Target
Working Capital Amount shall have no bearing on whether such item shall also
be excluded or included in the determination of the Final Working Capital
Amount. During the review by the Independent Arbitrator, the Securityholder
Representative and Parent shall each make available to the Independent
Arbitrator such partys current and former personnel and such information,
books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the
Independent Arbitrator to fulfill its obligations under this _Section
3.6(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of the
Securityholder Representative or Parent shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the Independent Arbitrator unless and until the
Independent Arbitrator has signed a customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants.

(d) The cost of the Independent Arbitrators review and determination shall
be borne on a proportionate basis by Parent, on the one hand, and the Equity
Holders, on the other (whose share shall be paid on their behalf by the
Securityholder Representative from the Escrow Funds), based on the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded in favor of each such
Person bears to the amount actually contested by such Person. By way of
illustration, if Parents calculations would have resulted in a $1,000,000
net payment to Parent, and the Securityholder Representatives calculations
would have resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment to the Equity Holders and the
Independent Arbitrators final determination as adopted pursuant to 

 



24

    

  _Section 3.6(c)_ results in an aggregate net payment of $500,000 to the
Equity Holders, then Parent and the Equity Holders (whose share shall be paid
on their behalf by the Securityholder Representative from the Escrow Funds)
shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of such fees and expenses.

(e) The " _Final Merger Consideration_ " shall be calculated by recalculating
the Estimated Merger Consideration using the Final Working Capital Amount in
lieu of the Estimated Working Capital Amount, using the Final Funded
Indebtedness in lieu of Estimated Funded Indebtedness, using Final Cash in
lieu of Estimated Cash and using the Final Company Transaction Expenses in
lieu of Estimated Company Transaction Expenses and otherwise using the
components of Estimated Merger Consideration as set forth in the definition
of Estimated Merger Consideration.

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the " _Deficiency Amount_ "),
Parent shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds promptly (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days after the Final Working Capital Amount,
Final Funded Indebtedness, Final Cash and Final Company Transaction Expenses
have been agreed upon (through deemed agreement or otherwise) or finally
determined by the Independent Arbitrator, in either case in accordance with
_Section 3.6(a)_), such Deficiency Amount from the Escrow Account; _provided_
, _however_ , in no event shall any Equity Holder have personal liability for
payment of such amount or any portion thereof, and Parents sole recourse
with respect thereto shall be the Escrow Funds held by the Escrow Agent.

(ii) If any Escrow Funds remain in the Escrow Account after (A) the payment
of the Deficiency Amount (or upon a final determination in accordance with
Section 3.6(a) that there is no Deficiency Amount) and (B) subject to _Section
3.6(f)(i)_, deducting the aggregate amount of all Securityholder
Representative Costs and Expenses (such remaining amount, the " _Remaining
Amount_ "), then Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay the Remaining Amount in accordance with _Section
3.6(f)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the amount of any
Securityholder Representative Costs and Expenses be deducted from the Escrow
Funds or paid to the Securityholder Representative unless and until all
amounts due to Parent in accordance with _Section 3.6(e)(i)_ have been paid
in full.

 

(iii) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Merger
Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the " _Excess Amount_ "),
Parent shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days after
the Final Working Capital Amount, Final Funded Indebtedness, Final Cash and
Final Company Transaction Expenses have been agreed (through deemed agreement
or otherwise) or determined by the Independent Arbitrator, in either case in
accordance with _Section 3.6(c)_) pay the Excess Amount in accordance with
_Section 3.6(f)_.

 



25

    

Parent and the Securityholder Representative hereby agree to deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to deliver promptly from the Escrow Account all funds to be
delivered in accordance with this _Section 3.6(e)_.

 

(f) If a payment is required to be made pursuant to _Section 3.6(e)(ii)_ or
_Section 3.6(e)(iii)_ (such payment, an " _Additional Amount_ "), such
Additional Amount shall be paid as follows:

(i) to the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder Representative
Costs and Expenses; _provided_ , the Securityholder Representative Costs and
Expenses shall not be paid to the Securityholder Representative on more than
one occasion, and then only to the extent any Escrow Funds remain in the
Escrow Account after paying in full to Parent any Deficiency Amount as
contemplated by _Section 3.6(e)(i)_;

 

(ii) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement, the
portion of such Additional Amount (less the Securityholder Representative
Costs and Expenses) allocable to the Company Common Stockholders (other than
in respect of Specified Shares) for further payment by the Paying Agent to
each Company Common Stockholder (other than in respect of Specified Shares)
in an amount equal to the product of (x) the Per Share Portion of such
Additional Amount (less the Securityholder Representative Costs and Expenses)
_multiplied by_ (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Specified Shares) held by such Company Common Stockholder; _provided_ ,
in the case of the portion of such Additional Amount (less the Securityholder
Representative Costs and Expenses) allocable to Grand Slam Holdings, LLC,
Grand Slam Holdings, LLC may direct the payee of such portion of such
Additional Amount to pay such portion directly to Grand Slam Holdings, LLC, in
which case such portion shall not be paid to the Paying Agent; and

 

(iii) to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of and as agent of the applicable
Company Optionholders, the portion of such Additional Amount (less the
Securityholder Representative Costs and Expenses) allocable to the Company
Optionholders and for further payment to each Company Optionholder in an
amount equal to the amount payable to each Company Optionholder equal to the
product of (x) the Per Share Portion of such Additional Amount (less the
Securityholder Representative Costs and Expenses) _multiplied by_ (y) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested
portions of the Company Options (other than those Company Options cancelled
for no Company Option Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)_) held by such Company Optionholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time, without interest and net of any amounts that are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any applicable provision of Law and (B)
on behalf of and as agent of the applicable Company RSU Holders, the portion
of such Additional Amount (less the Securityholder Representative Costs and
Expenses) allocable to the Company RSU Holders and for further payment to each
Company RSU Holder in an amount equal to the amount payable to each Company
RSU Holder equal to the product of (x) 

 



26

business. Except as set forth in  _Section 4.20(b)(v)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, for the last three (3) years, there are no unpaid refunds
due to a Payor in excess of $50,000 based on the findings of any internal or
external audit.  _Section 4.20(b)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule

of, or Payors with respect to, healthcare products or services of the Company
and the Subsidiaries by net invoiced amount for the twelve (12)-month period
ended on the Latest Balance Sheet Date (the " _Material Payors_ "). For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, to determine whether any Payor that is
part of a national Payor organization is a Material Payor, the net invoiced
amounts for such Payor shall be combined across all Payors within the
national Payor organization, and such national Payor organization shall be
listed as a Material Payor. Except as set forth in _Section 4.21_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any written notice from any Material Payor to the effect that such
Material Payor will stop, decrease the rate of, or change the terms (whether
related to payment, price, reimbursement rates, coverage or otherwise) with
respect to, the business such Material Payor conducts with the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries (whether as a result of the consummation of the
transactions or otherwise). Except as set forth on _Section 4.21_ of the

from any Governmental Entity or Payor.

(b) Except as disclosed on _Section 4.22(b)_ of the Company Disclosure

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any obligation
arising under an administrative or regulatory action, FDA inspection, FDA
warning letter, FDA notice of violation letter or other notice, response or
commitment made to or with the FDA or any comparable Governmental Entity.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has made all notifications,
submissions, responses and reports required by FDA Laws, including any such

notice of violation letter, or comparable actions by other Governmental
Entities, and all such notifications, submissions, responses and reports were
true, complete and correct as of the date of submission to the FDA or any
comparable Governmental Entity.

(c) Except as disclosed on _Section 4.22(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, during the past three (3) years no Product has been seized,
withdrawn, recalled or subject to a suspension of manufacturing, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances reasonably
likely to cause: (i) the seizure, withdrawal, recall, import detention, field
correction, safety alert or suspension of manufacturing relating to any such
product; (ii) a change in the labeling of any such product; or (iii) a
termination, modification or suspension of the marketing or distribution
(including for commercial or investigational use) of any such product. No

Disclosure Schedule (to the Knowledge of the Company, solely as to data
vendors), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has notified, or
been required to notify, any person of any information security breach or

Subs ability to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

and the other Transaction Agreements by Parent or the consummation by Parent

50

    

Section 5.6 _Financial Ability_. Parent has delivered to the Company a
true, complete and correct copy of the executed commitment letter, (including
all related term sheets, exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, and the
executed fee letters associated therewith (redacted in a manner as described
below), collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), by and among Parent
and the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, pursuant to which the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes of funding a portion of (i) the Closing
Payments and the other payments under _Article III_ , (ii) the fees and
expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the Merger and the Debt Financing, (iii)
amounts required to pay for any refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness
of the Company or its Subsidiaries as contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
amounts required to satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub as of the Closing Date (collectively the items set forth in clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the " _Required Payments_ "). As of the date
hereof, assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, the funds provided by the
Debt Financing will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to pay the
Required Payments. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn,
terminated, amended or modified since the date of delivery hereunder and prior
to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement no such
withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated, and as of
the date of this Agreement the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded by Parent
or Merger Sub (or to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, any other party
thereto) in any respect. Except for (i) the fee letter(s) referred to above
(complete copies of which have been provided to the Company, with only fee
amounts and the economic terms (other than covenants) related to the "market
flex" provisions contained therein redacted) (provided that Parent represents
and warrants that the "market flex" provisions in such fee letters do not
permit the imposition of any new conditions (or the modification or expansion
of any existing conditions) or any reduction in the amount of the Debt
Financing) with respect to the Debt Financing, (ii) customary engagement
letters and (iii) customary agreements relating to alternative capital
markets financings (none of which adversely affect the amount, conditionality,
enforceability, termination or availability of the Debt Financing), as of the
date hereof there are no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party related to the provision or funding, as applicable, of the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby other than as expressly set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company on the date
hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof and will pay any and all such fees when and as the
same become due and payable after the date hereof pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the
knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Debt Financing (including pursuant to any "market
flex" provisions in the fee letters or otherwise), other than as expressly set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub or, to the

 



51

    

 knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) assuming the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
and _Section 7.2_ will be satisfied, constitute a failure to satisfy a
condition on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent,
any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter or (iii) assuming the
conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ will be satisfied,
to the knowledge of Parent, result in any portion of the amounts to be
provided or funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter being
unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, assuming the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.12 will be satisfied, Parent
has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or, except
to the extent reduced prior to the Closing Date in a manner expressly
permitted by the terms of _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_, that the amount of the Debt
Financing necessary to fund the Required Payments will not be made available
to Parent and Merger Sub in full on the Closing Date, and, as of the date
hereof, Parent is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that would
or would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions to the Debt Financing
not to be satisfied or, except to the extent reduced prior to the Closing
Date in a manner expressly permitted by the terms of _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_,
the amount of the Debt Financing necessary to fund the Required Payments not
to be made available to Parent and Merger Sub in full on the Closing Date.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the
Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Parent or
Merger Sub obtain the Debt Financing or any other financing for or related to
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.7 _Solvency_. Assuming that the conditions to the obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 7.1_
and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived, then immediately following
the Effective Time and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the Closing Payments
and payment of all related fees and expenses, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole,
will not: (i) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such
that the sum of its debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is
greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable
value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its probable
liability on its existing debts, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature); (ii) have unreasonably small capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; or (iii)
have incurred debts, or be expected to incur debts, including contingent and
other liabilities, beyond its ability to pay them as they become due.

 

Section 5.8 _Brokers and Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is or will become entitled to receive any
commission, brokerage, finders fee or other similar compensation in
connection with the consummation of the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any liability prior
to Closing.

 

Section 5.9 _Investigation; No Other Representations_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the
business, operations, assets, Contracts, Intellectual Property, real estate,
technology, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of them acknowledges
that it and its Representatives have received access to such books and
records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that it and its Representatives have 

 



52

    

 requested to review and that it and its Representatives have had the
opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss the
business and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on behalf of
the Company makes, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon, any
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided to
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the accuracy, completeness or currency thereof other than
the representations and warranties expressly contained, and subject to the
qualifications and limitations, in _Article IV_ (as modified by the Company
Disclosure Schedule) and the certificates delivered in connection herewith.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
and agrees that, except for any remedies available under this Agreement with
respect to the representations and warranties expressly set forth, and subject
to the qualifications and limitations, in _Article IV_ (as modified by the
Company Disclosure Schedule) and the certificates delivered in connection
herewith, neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability or other obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives or Affiliates or any other Person resulting from Parents,
Merger Subs or their Representatives or Affiliates use of any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent,
Merger Sub or their Representatives or Affiliates, including any information
made available in the Electronic Data Room, teasers, marketing materials,
consulting reports or materials, confidential information memoranda,
management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions, responses to
questions submitted on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.2 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) From the Closing until the one-year anniversary of Closing (or until
the earlier termination of employment of the applicable Company Employee),
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to,
provide to the Company Employees: (i) a base salary or base rate of pay no
less favorable than each such Company Employees base salary or base rate of
pay provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (ii)
target annual cash compensation opportunities (excluding any long-term cash
compensation opportunity) no less favorable than each such Company Employees
target annual cash compensation opportunities in effect immediately prior to
the Closing; and (iii) employee benefits substantially comparable in the
aggregate to such benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Closing (including severance payments and severance benefits,
but excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation,
retiree health or welfare benefits, equity or equity based compensation, and
long-term incentive compensation); _provided_ , that, in no event will Parent
be required to provide, or to cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates to provide, any employee benefits which are greater than those
provided to its similarly situated employees of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, if any Company Employee terminates employment on or
prior to the one-year anniversary of Closing as a result of a Qualifying
Termination (as defined in the DJO Global Severance Pay Plan, such Company
Employee shall be entitled to (and Parent shall cause

 



56

    

 the Surviving Corporation and/or its Affiliates to provide) the severance
benefits as set forth on _Section 6.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Company Severance Plan_ "), subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Company Severance Plan and the applicable Company Employees
timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form
to be approved by Parent;  _provided_ , that any severance payment or benefit
under the Company Severance Plan shall be determined (A) without regard to the
requirement set forth in Section 4 of the DJO Global Severance Play Plan
providing that employees must be employed for one year or more with the
Company to be eligible to receive any severance; and (B) taking into account
such Company Employees additional service time with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Affiliates after the Closing. Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates to, maintain the
Company Severance Plan without any amendment, modification or alteration
thereto until the date that is the one-year anniversary of Closing.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates, as applicable, to give Company Employees credit for such Company
Employees service with the Company and its Affiliates for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of vacation, disability
and severance benefits to the same extent and for the same purpose
as recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing, under the
corresponding benefit plans made available to employees or officers or any
class or level of employees or officers of Parent or any of its Affiliates in
which a Company Employee participates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized (i) for any purposes with respect to any
defined benefit pension plans, or (ii) to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates, as applicable, to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive
any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates that provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing, to the extent waived or
satisfied with respect to such employees as of the Closing under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums incurred by Company Employees and their eligible dependents under the
health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing
during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing in satisfying
the corresponding deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under
health plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to
participate after the Closing in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the extent such
Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing.

 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 6.2_ with respect to Company Employees are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right
(i) in any other person, including any Company Employees or other employees,
former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company
Benefit Plan or any benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates, or (ii) to
continued employment or any particular term or condition of employment with
the Company, 

 



57

    

 Parent or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained in this
_Section 6.2_ shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Company
Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement. After the Effective Time, nothing contained in this _Section
6.2_ shall interfere with the right of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan
or any benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates (subject, in each case, to the
provisions of _Section 6.2(a)_ and _Section 6.2(b)_ above as between the
parties hereto) or to terminate the employment of any Company Employee for
any reason.

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) seek from each person
who has a right to any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein that would be deemed to
constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) a waiver of such persons
rights to some or all of such payments and/or benefits (the " _Waived 280G
Benefits_ ") applicable to such person so that all remaining payments and/or
benefits applicable to such person shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code and (ii)
seek the approval of its stockholders who are entitled to vote in a manner
that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1, which shall include adequate written disclosure to all
stockholders who are entitled to vote prior to such vote, of any such
Waived 280G Benefits. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the
Company shall forward to Parent the parachute payment calculations prepared by
the Company and/or its advisors. Additionally, at least seven (7) Business
Days prior to obtaining the Section 280G waivers, and prior to seeking such
stockholder approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and
such stockholder approval materials to Parent for its review and comment.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that
a vote of the Companys stockholders who are entitled to vote was solicited in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.2(e)_ and that
either (1) the requisite number of stockholder votes was obtained with
respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (2) the 280G
Approval was not obtained.

 

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall communicate and cooperate with each other
prior to any press release or public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, agree that no public release or announcement
concerning the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
by any party without the prior written consent of the other party, except such
release or announcement as may be required by Law or the rules and
regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the
Companys Affiliates or Parent or one of its Affiliates are listed, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent, the
Securityholder Representative and the Company are permitted to (A) report and
disclose the status and terms (including price terms) of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby to their (or the case of the Company, its
sponsors) direct or indirect limited partners if required by those governing
documents with those limited partners and otherwise in the ordinary course of
their business or stockholders in the ordinary course of their business and
(B) disclose the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (but
not, without the consent of the other parties, price terms or the name of
such other parties) on their websites and otherwise

 



58

    

 in the ordinary course of their business and (ii) the Company and Parent are
permitted to report and disclose the status of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to an internal communication or
otherwise to its employees.

Section 6.4 _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the
information provided in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
between Colfax Corporation and DJO Global, Inc., dated as of September 11,
2018 (as amended or modified from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") and that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall keep all
information related to the transactions contemplated hereby confidential in
accordance with the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (other than as otherwise expressly permitted by the Confidentiality
Agreement and this Agreement); _provided_ , that, from and after the date
hereof Parent shall be permitted to share Evaluation Material (as such term
is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) with any of its Representatives
or financing sources (or their respective Representatives or otherwise in
connection with the Financing on a confidential basis) in connection with the
consummation of the Merger or the Financing notwithstanding any consent
requirement set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate at the earlier of the Effective Time and the
expiration or termination thereof in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 6.5 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to applicable Laws and _Section
6.4_, Parent shall be entitled, through its officers, employees and
Representatives (including their respective legal advisors and accountants),
to have such access to the properties, businesses and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and such examination of the books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests upon reasonable
advance written notice in connection with Parents efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any such access and
examination shall be conducted during regular business hours and under
circumstances that do not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of
the business and shall be subject to restrictions under applicable Law. The
Company shall cause the officers, employees, consultants, agents,
accountants, attorneys and other Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent and Parents Representatives in
connection with such access and examination, and Parent and
its Representatives shall cooperate with the Company and its Representatives
and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption
to the business in connection therewith. Any disclosure during such
investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall not constitute any
enlargement or additional representation or warranty of the Company beyond
those specifically set forth in _Article IV_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, no such access or examination shall be permitted to the
extent that it (i) relates to interactions with prospective buyers of the
Company or the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (iii) is that portion of Company board materials
regarding the consideration of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) would require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to disclose information that in the reasonable judgment and
good faith of counsel to the Company, is subject to attorney-client privilege
or may conflict with any applicable Law or confidentiality obligations to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound (in which case the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to provide such access in a manner
which would not so violate or jeopardize such privilege or legal or
confidentiality restriction).

 



59

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the
Closing, (i) without the written consent of the Company (which may be
withheld in the Companys sole discretion), Parent shall not contact any
suppliers, vendors or customers of the Company or any Subsidiary, other than
in the ordinary course of business of Parent or any of its Affiliates with
respect to matters not involving the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby, and provided that the Company shall have the
right to have a Representative present during any such restricted contact in
the event that it consents to such contact, and (ii) Parent shall have no
right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or
facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of the Company (which may be withheld in the Companys sole
discretion).

 

Section 6.6 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done as
promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper and advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to appropriate confidentiality
protections, each party hereto shall furnish to the other parties such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another and use their
reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary documentation (including
furnishing all information required under any applicable Competition Laws) to
effect promptly all necessary filings with any Governmental Entity and to
obtain all consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder. Each party
hereto shall provide to the other parties copies of all correspondence between
it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Antitrust Entity or other
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the matters described in this _Section 6.6._ Each of the
parties hereto shall promptly inform the other of any substantive oral
communication with, and provide copies of any written communications with,
any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No
party hereto shall independently participate in any substantive meeting or
substantive conference call with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other
party prior notice of the substantive meeting or substantive conference call
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend or participate. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the Competition
Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section 6.6_, the parties agree that Parent shall control the strategy
and process of all such filings and notifications under Competition Laws (and
no agreement with any Governmental Entity shall be entered into with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
Parent, and no communication with any Governmental Entity shall take place
other than with Parent present or party thereto). The parties

 



60

    

 hereto may, as they deem advisable, redact any materials as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns (including with
respect to other businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Parents or the
Companys respective Affiliates), and to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or Parent and its Subsidiaries,
or designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other
under this _Section 6.6(b)_ or any other section of this Agreement as "legal
counsel only." Materials designated "legal counsel only" and the information
contained therein shall be given only to legal counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such legal counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party
providing such materials.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide or cause to be provided (including by their "ultimate parent entities"
as that term is defined in the HSR Act) as promptly as practicable to any
Governmental Antitrust Entity information and documents requested by
such Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including filing any notification or draft notification and report form and
related material required under (i) the HSR Act as promptly as practicable,
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof and
(ii) any Competition Law set forth on _Section 6.6(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof; _provided_ that the Company
promptly provides responses to any request for information or documentation,
and complies promptly with the formalities required by the foreign filings,
and thereafter to respond promptly to any request for additional information
or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act and any similar
Competition Law regarding pre-acquisition notifications for the purpose of
competition reviews. Parent shall cause (and shall cause its "ultimate parent
entity" as that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause) the filings made by
it under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early termination," and
make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or
advisable in connection therewith. Parent shall be responsible for all filing
fees payable to a Governmental Entity applicable to Parent and its ultimate
parent entity under the HSR Act and under any such other Competition Laws
applicable to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any applicable Law or if any Action is instituted
by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any applicable Law, each of
the parties hereto shall, at its own cost and expense, use its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against any action to prevent or enjoin
consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby); and
(ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to overturn any regulatory
action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin consummation of this
Agreement (and the transactions contemplated hereby), including by defending
any Action brought by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary,
in order to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental
Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such applicable
Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



61

    

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to obtain any authorization,
consent or approval of a Governmental Entity (including in connection with any
Governmental Filings) necessary or advisable so as to enable the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, to occur as expeditiously as
reasonably practicable (and in any event, no later than the Outside Date) and
to resolve, avoid or eliminate any impediments or objections, if any, that may
be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Competition Law, including: (i) taking such actions and agreeing to such
requirements or conditions to mitigate any concerns as may be requested or
required by a Governmental Entity in connection with any Governmental
Filing, (ii) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of, or holding separate of, businesses, product lines, rights or
assets of Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries) or any interest therein (including entering into customary
ancillary agreements relating to any such sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of such business, product lines, rights or assets), (iii)
terminating or restructuring existing relationships, contractual or governance
rights or obligations of Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries), (iv) terminating any venture or other
arrangement and (v) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after
the Closing Date would limit Parents or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries), freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain or control, one or more of the
businesses, product lines, rights or assets of Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), in each case as
may be required in order to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no later than the Outside Date) and to otherwise oppose, avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any order, decree, judgment, preliminary
or permanent injunction that would otherwise have the effect of preventing,
prohibiting, restricting or delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and in that regard Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to,
agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit
to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to Parents
or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporations and its
Subsidiaries), ability to retain or control, any of the businesses, product
lines, rights or assets of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or any interest therein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent
or the Company to take or agree to take any such action not conditioned on
the consummation of the Closing.

(f) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or
consolidating with, or by purchasing all or a majority of the assets of or any
equity in, any Person, if the execution and delivery of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to, in any material respect: (i) impose any delay in obtaining, or
increase the risk of not obtaining, consents of a Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the
risk of a Governmental Entity seeking or entering a Governmental Order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii)
otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 6.7 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
Company Benefit Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary
of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and former officer, director or
manager of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Individuals_
") from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Individual is or was an officer, director or manager of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the other transactions and
actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent provided by the organizational
documents and indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each Indemnified
Individual will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense
of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Parent from
the Indemnified Individual of a request therefor (subject to receipt by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking to repay such expenses upon a
final, non-appealable judgement from a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Person is not entitled to indemnification), (y) neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Individual hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Individual from
all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim or such Indemnified Individual otherwise consents and (z) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that any
indemnification and advancement of expenses available to any Indemnified
Individual by virtue of such Indemnified Individuals service as a partner or
employee of any investment fund that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to
the Closing (any such Indemnified Individual, a " _Sponsor Director_ ") shall
be secondary to the indemnification and advancement of expenses to be provided
by Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ and
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation (i) shall be the primary
indemnitors of first resort for Sponsor Directors pursuant to this _Section
6.7_, (ii) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of all expenses and
the payment of all Losses with respect to Sponsor Directors which are
addressed by this _Section 6.7_ in accordance with the terms hereof and (iii)
shall not make any claim for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery
of any kind in respect of any other indemnification available to any Sponsor
Director with respect to any matter addressed by this _Section 6.7_, in each
case to the extent any such matter, claim, expenses or indemnification relates
solely to such Indemnified Individuals services in connection with the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

(c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent governing
documents) of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors,
managers and officers than are set forth in the organizational documents of

 



63

    

 the Company (or equivalent governing documents) as of the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, other than as may be
required by applicable Law.

 

(d) Prior to or as of the Closing Date, at its option Parent shall (or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) either (i) purchase a "tail" insurance
policy for a period of six years after the Effective Time, with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous than
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective
Time or (ii) provide coverage under Parents or one of its Subsidiaries
existing directors and officers liability insurance with respect to claims
arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before
the Effective Time which is no less advantageous than the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, in no case shall such tail policy or
incremental insurance premium cost more than 300% of the Companys annual
director and officer insurance premium as of the date hereof (and, in such
case, Parent shall obtain the best coverage reasonably available for such
amount). Parent agrees to take all reasonable actions to maintain such
policies in full force and effect and fulfill its obligations thereunder
throughout such six-year period following the Effective Time.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) with
respect to which this _Section 6.7_ applies is made against any Indemnified
Individual on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action or investigation.

(f) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals and their respective
heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Individual
is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

(g) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this  _Section
6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Without limiting the
parties obligations under _Section 6.6_, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist and
cooperate with the other

 



64

Section 6.9 _Parent Financing_.

 

(a) _Financing_.

 

(i) Subject to _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof but taking into effect the provisions of
_Section 2.2_, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary to arrange, obtain and, on or prior to the Closing Date, consummate
(x) the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in or
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including complying with any
request requiring the exercise of so-called "market flex" provisions in the
fee letter) and (y) if applicable, any Permanent Financing on the terms and
conditions contemplated thereby, including using reasonable best efforts to
(A) (I) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to the
provisions of  _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_) and to consummate the Debt Financing
and, if applicable, any Permanent Financing at or prior to the Closing and
(II) comply with their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Financing Agreements and enforce their rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Financing Agreements and (B) subject to
the provisions of _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_, negotiate, enter into and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to (x) the Debt Financing reflecting the
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions applicable thereto) or on terms that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto)
or (y) if applicable, any Permanent Financing or the terms and conditions
contemplated thereby, in each case, which terms shall not in any respect
expand on the conditions to the funding of the Financing at the Closing or
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing available to be funded at the
Closing below the amount required to fund the Required Payments (any such
definitive agreement, the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ "). Upon written
request, Parent shall inform the Company of the status of Parents efforts to
obtain the Debt Financing and, if applicable, any Permanent Financing in
reasonable detail and shall promptly respond to any written request from the
Company concerning such status. Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days, after Parent has knowledge
thereof, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (x) the Debt Commitment
Letter or any of the commitments with respect to the

 



65

    

 Debt Financing thereunder or any Definitive Financing Agreement entered into
in replacement of all or a portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or in connection with any Permanent Financing, as
applicable, shall expire or be terminated (except, in the case of the Debt
Commitment Letter only, in accordance with the terms of _Section
6.9(a)(iii)_), (y) for any reason, all or a portion of the Financing under
the Debt Commitment Letter or under any Definitive Financing Agreement entered
into in replacement of all or a portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter or in connection with any Permanent
Financing becomes unavailable (except in accordance with the terms of
_Section 6.9(a)(iii)_) or (z) any Debt Financing Source or any other Person
that is a party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing
Agreements breaches, defaults or repudiates the Debt Commitment Letter or
such Definitive Financing Agreement and which breach, default or repudiation
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality, timing,
availability or amount of the Financing necessary to fund the Required
Payments. To the extent that Parent reasonably believes in good faith that it
will not have funds available that are sufficient to enable it to make the
Required Payments or if Parent otherwise becomes aware that any portion of
the Financing has become unavailable under the Debt Commitment Letter or under
the Definitive Financing Agreements, except in accordance with the terms of
_Section 6.9(a)(iii)_ (and Parent shall not agree or consent to such
Debt Financing becoming unavailable except as permitted under _Section
6.9(a)(iii)_), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
the same or alternative sources (A) with conditions to the funding of such
alternative financing not more onerous, when taken as a whole, than those
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement) and (B) in an amount sufficient (when taken together with the
proceeds of any other financing that has already been obtained in accordance
with _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_) to pay the Required Payments (such alternative
financing, the " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ that, Parent shall
have no obligation to pay any fees in excess of what it was obligated to pay
under the original Debt Commitment Letter nor obtain Financing on terms
(including with respect to interest rates) materially worse than the terms
contained in the original Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of
this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with any portion
of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Payments.

 

(ii) In the event the Debt Financing (or any Permanent Financing or Equity
Financing) or any portion thereof is funded in advance of the Closing Date,
then Parent, Merger Sub or any other applicable subsidiary thereof shall keep
and maintain the availability at all times prior to the Closing Date the
proceeds of the Debt Financing (or any Permanent Financing or
Equity Financing) solely for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Required Payments; _provided_
that if the terms of the Debt Financing (or any Permanent Financing or Equity
Financing) require the proceeds of the Debt

 



66

    

 Financing (or any Permanent Financing or Equity Financing) to be held in
escrow (or similar arrangement) pending the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, then such proceeds may be held in escrow,
so long as the conditions to the release of such funds are no more onerous to
Parent than the conditions to borrowing of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
modification, termination or reduction of, or grant any waiver of, any
condition, remedy or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Company if such amendment, supplement, modification, termination, reduction or
waiver would or would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the
Closing, (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand any of
the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing, (C) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or (D) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing
Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9(a)_
to the contrary, Parent or Merger Sub may (w) amend, supplement or modify the
Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, (x) enter into other debt
financing arrangements and thereby reduce all or a portion of the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing by the amount of, or the amount of any commitment
(but not for the avoidance of doubt pursuant to revolving credit or other
working capital facilities, other than with respect to amounts actually drawn
thereunder on the Closing Date and immediately funded in accordance with this
Agreement to make the Required Payments) for, any such debt financing so long
as the conditions to funding under such debt financing arrangements
satisfy clauses (A) through (D) above (as determined by Parent in good faith)
(any such debt financing, a " _Permanent Financing_ " and, together with the
Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "), (y) reduce and/or replace the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing by the net proceeds raised by Parent and/or any
of its Subsidiaries through any Equity Financing and (z) reduce and/or replace
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing by the amount of net proceeds from
any sale or other disposition of any assets or property thereof (" _Asset
Sales_ ") received at or prior to such reduction or replacement. Upon any
amendment, supplement, modification, termination, reduction or waiver of the
Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_ or any
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter otherwise in accordance with
_Section 6.9(a)(i)_, (i) references herein to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall
include such document as amended, supplemented, modified, terminated, reduced
or waived in compliance with this _Section 6.9(a)(iii)_ or replaced otherwise
in accordance with  _Section 6.9(a)(i)_ and (ii) references to "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as amended, supplemented, modified or waived in compliance with this
Section 6.9(a). 

 



67

    

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide to Parent and Merger Sub, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, directors and employees to use reasonable best
efforts and shall use its reasonable best efforts to direct its and their
respective Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide to
Parent and Merger Sub, in each case, to the extent required by _Section
6.9(c)_, at Parents sole expense, all reasonable cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent that is necessary and customary in connection with the
Financing and any Equity Financing and the repayment of the Funded
Indebtedness as set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and the release of collateral in connection therewith, which
reasonable cooperation shall include using reasonable best efforts to: (i)
upon reasonable advance notice, cause senior management of Company and its
Subsidiaries to participate in a reasonable number of sessions with rating
agencies, lender or investor meetings, road shows, due diligence sessions
with prospective lenders and purchasers of the Financing or any Equity
Financing and cooperate with the marketing efforts of Parent and Merger Sub
and their financing sources, in each case in connection with all or any
portion of the Financing or any Equity Financing; (ii) assist with the
preparation of portions of customary materials for lender and rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries required in connection with the Financing or any
Equity Financing and designating, upon request, whether such information is
suitable to be made available to lenders and other investors who do not wish
to receive material non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (iii) as promptly as practicable, furnish Parent and Merger Sub
with the Company Information and, subject to the limitations set forth in the
definition of Company Information, such other customary financial and
operating information and data of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably
requested by Parent that is required in connection with the Financing or any
Equity Financing contemplated by Parent (or one of its Subsidiaries) and to
the extent that any such Company Information is not Compliant when delivered
or at any time prior to Closing ceases to be Compliant, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts, working with the Companys auditors, to
deliver Company Information that is Compliant as soon as reasonably
practicable after such information ceases to be Compliant initially, (iv)
facilitate (including by delivery of customary representation letters)
cooperation with the Financing or any Equity Financing by the Companys
independent auditors, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain
"customary" comfort letters (including "customary" negative assurances) in
connection with the Financing or any Equity Financing, providing final drafts
of such comfort letters which such auditors would be prepared to issue upon
completion of customary procedures and facilitate direct contact with such
independent auditors for participation in a reasonable number of due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and other meetings upon reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours and obtaining any consents required to
include the historical financial statements included in the Company
Information in any registration statement or applicable Parent SEC filing, (v)

and/or management representation letters to Parent and the Debt Financing
Sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders in
any "bank" or "bridge" confidential information memorandum (or private
supplement thereto), in each case solely with respect to the portion of such
information contained such confidential information memorandum (or supplement)
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries (and not any other part of such
information); (vi) assist with the preparation of any definitive financing

otherwise pursuing any reasonable and customary approach chosen by Parent to
the defeasance, satisfaction and discharge, constructive satisfaction and
discharge, redemption, termination, amendment or other treatment of, such
Funded Indebtedness (including any redemption, tender offer or consent
solicitation)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (w) nothing in this _Section
6.9_ shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (I) unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or (II) subject any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries respective
directors, managers, partners, members, officers or employees or other
Representatives to any actual or potential personal liability (other than with
respect to customary authorization letters referred to above), (x) none of
the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be required to deliver or obtain
opinions of internal or external counsel in connection with obtaining the

any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing, in each case, unless promptly reimbursed
or otherwise indemnified in accordance with the terms hereof and (z) nothing
in this _Section 6.9_ shall require any action that would (i) conflict with
or violate the Companys or any Subsidiaries organizational documents or any
Laws or result in the contravention of, or that would result in a breach of,
or a default under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with a third party (and not entered into
in contemplated thereof), to the extent the Company and its Subsidiaries uses
reasonable best efforts to provide such information in a manner that does not
breach such Law, undertaking or obligation, (ii) provide access to or disclose
information where the Company reasonably determines that such access or
disclosure would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege, _provided_ , however, that Company shall inform Parent of the
general nature of the information being withheld and, upon Parents
reasonable prior written request, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such information or documents to be provided in a
manner that would not reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of such
privilege, (iii) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or any other
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (iv)
cause any condition to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_,  _Section

or their respective officers, directors, managers,

 



69

    

 partners, members or employees shall be required to execute, deliver or
enter into or perform any agreement, document or instrument with respect to
the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Closing (other than customary engagement letters with,
and management representation letters to, the Companys independent auditors
and the authorization letters referenced above), and no directors, managers,
partners and members of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be required to
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant
to which the Financing or any Equity Financing is obtained unless Parent
shall have determined that such director or manager of the Companys
Subsidiaries are to remain as directors or managers of the Companys
Subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date and such resolutions are contingent
upon the occurrence of, or only effective as of, the Effective Time. To the
extent that this _Section 6.9_ requires the Companys and its Subsidiaries
cooperation with respect to any obligations relating to the Financing or any
Equity Financing or the repayment of the Funded Indebtedness as set forth on
_Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the release of
collateral in connection therewith, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed to have complied with this _Section 6.9_ for purposes of _Article
VIII_ of this Agreement if the Company and its Subsidiaries have provided
Parent with the assistance required under this _Section 6.9_ with respect to
the Financing or any Equity Financing and the repayment of the Funded
Indebtedness as set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and the release of collateral in connection therewith.

 

(c) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company, its

Indebtedness as set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the release of Liens and termination of security interests in
connection therewith and the performance of their respective obligations under
this _Section 6.9_ and any information utilized in connection therewith,
except to the extent resulting from the fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such persons (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). If the Closing does not
occur, Parent shall, promptly upon request of the Company, reimburse the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries

cooperation required by this _Section 6.9_.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in this _Section 6.9_ represent the sole obligation
of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the Financing, any Equity Financing and the repayment of the Funded
Indebtedness as set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and the release of collateral in connection therewith, and no other provision
of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall
be deemed to expand or modify such obligations.

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and its
Subsidiaries by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Financing or any
Equity Financing; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or that is not

personnel available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice,

required by such party in connection with any insurance claims by, legal
proceedings or Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, or
compliance with applicable Laws by, the Securityholder Representative, the
Equity Holders or any of their Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, no such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent
that it (i) relates to the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including relevant portions of board materials), (ii)
would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) would require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to disclose information that in
the reasonable judgment and good faith of their counsel, is subject to
attorney-client privilege or may conflict with any applicable Law or
confidentiality obligations to which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries is bound (in which case Parent or the Surviving Company,
as applicable, will use reasonable best efforts to provide such access in a
manner which would not so violate or jeopardize such privilege or legal or
confidentiality restriction).

 

Section 6.11 _Escrow Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement_. At the Closing,
each of Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall duly execute and
deliver to the other, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent to duly execute and deliver to Parent and
the Securityholder Representative, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, respectively.

Section 6.12 _Certain Consents_. Without limiting any of the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth herein, Parent acknowledges and
agrees, on behalf of itself, that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated hereby may be required from Governmental Entities or parties to
Contracts or other agreements to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
is a party and that such consents have not been obtained as of the date hereof
and may not be obtained prior to the Closing; provided, that, the Company and
its Subsidiaries comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement with respect thereto, including _Section 6.6_ and _Section 6.8_.

 

Section 6.13 _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company

reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 

Section 6.14 _Termination of Related Party Contracts_. At or prior to the
Closing, but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such actions as may be necessary to terminate the Related Party
Contracts, other than those Related Party Contracts set forth on _Section
6.14_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with no further obligations of the
Company or its Affiliates from and after the Closing in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and deliver evidence thereof to Parent.

 



71

    

Section 6.15 _Written Consent_. Within twenty-four (24) hours after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent
the Written Consent.

Section 6.16  _Company Financial Statements_. The Company and its

practicable following the end of the applicable fiscal period (taking into
account the Company or its applicable Subsidiarys historical practices and
the time required for auditor review); _provided_ , that, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be in compliance with any deadlines set forth
in this _Section 6.16_ to the extent they comply with such provisions within
two (2) days of a breach thereof.

Parent may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_ if it

Section 8.3 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.1_, then each of the parties shall be relieved of its duties and
obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination
(other than obligations that by their terms are to be performed following any
such termination, including the payment of the Parent Termination Fee when
and if required pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_) and such termination shall be
without liability to the Company or Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
subject to the terms of this  _Section 8.3_, (i) no such termination shall
(A) restrict the availability of specific performance, if any, set forth in
_Section 10.13_ with respect to surviving obligations that are to be
performed following such termination or (B) relieve any party hereto from
liability for damages resulting from any Willful Breach and (ii) the
provisions of _Section 6.3_, _Section 6.4_, this _Article VIII_ , _Section
9.1_ and  _Article X_ shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. For purposes of
this _Section 8.3_, the term " _Willful Breach_ " means a partys knowing
and intentional material breach of any of its representations or warranties as
set forth in this Agreement, or such partys material breach of any of its
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which material
breach constitutes, or is a consequence of, a purposeful act or failure to
act by such party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to
take such act would cause a material breach of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or  _Section 8.1(f)_, Parent shall pay to the
Company a fee of $220,500,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, such payment to be made within three
(3) Business Days of the applicable termination.

(c) The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Parent Termination Fee
if, as and when required to be paid in accordance with this _Section 8.3_,
shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount (including the
Equity Holders) in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The
parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall Parent be required
to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
this Agreement is validly terminated in circumstances in which the Company
has the right to receive the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_, the receipt by the

 



75

    

 Company of the Parent Termination Fee (and reimbursement for any costs and
expenses of the Company in accordance with _Section 6.9(c)_ and _Section
8.3(e)_, if applicable) shall, subject to _Section 10.13_ (subject to the
limitations set forth therein), be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company , the Securityholder Representative, the Equity Holders and each of
their respective Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the " _Company

former, current or future stockholders, controlling Persons, managers,
members, partners, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or successors or any
former, current or future stockholder, controlling Person, manager, member,
partners, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative, agent,
assignee or successor of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") or any Debt Financing Sources Related Parties for any loss
or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or other
transactions contemplated hereunder to be consummated or for a breach of, or
failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other document
delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of
any representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Parent Related
Parties or Debt Financing Sources Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Merger, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except that nothing shall relieve
Parent of its obligations under _Section 6.3_, _Section 6.4_, _Section
6.9(c)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except for the right to seek specific
performance in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of
_Section 10.13_, the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Parent Related Parties for any
breach, loss, damage or failure to perform under this Agreement (including any
Willful Breach) or any certificate or other document delivered in connection
herewith or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith shall be for
the Company to (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ (if
such termination is available) and receive payment of the Parent Termination
Fee from Parent or (y) seek to recover monetary damages from Parent, subject
to _Section 8.3(a)_; _provided_ that (A) the maximum aggregate monetary
liability of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder shall be limited to the
amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee (plus the reimbursement for any
costs and expenses of the Company in accordance with _Section 6.9(c)_ and
_Section 8.3(e)_, if applicable), (B) in no event shall the Company seek
to recover any money damages in excess of such amount and (C) in no event
shall the Company be entitled to both the payment of any monetary damages
whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of the Parent Termination Fee (plus
the reimbursement for any costs and expenses of the Company in accordance
with _Section 6.9(c)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_, if applicable), on the other
hand; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event will the Company be entitled
to recover both the Parent Termination Fee or money damages, on the one hand,
and specific performance of this Agreement, on the other hand.

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into
this Agreement. If Parent fails to timely pay the Parent Termination Fee when
due and payable in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_, Parent shall pay to the
Company interest on the amount of the Parent Termination Fee from the date
such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at a per annum
rate based on the prime

 



76

    

 rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on
the date of such payment, plus 4%. Any amount payable pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_ shall be paid by Parent by wire transfer of same day funds.

Representatives or any other Person or Non-Recourse Party has made or makes

whether written or oral, on behalf of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries
or their respective Affiliates or other Representatives or any other Person or
Non-Recourse Party.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ (as modified by the

of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any other Person will have or
be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation on any basis
(including in contract or tort, under applicable federal or state securities
Laws or otherwise) to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from
the sharing with Parent and Merger Sub or their Representatives, or Parents
or Merger Subs use of any information, documents, projections, forecasts or
other materials made available to Parent or Merger Sub in the Electronic Data
Room or management presentations (or omissions therefrom) in expectation of
the Merger or otherwise. Except for the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article IV_ (as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule) or
in any certificate delivered hereunder, it is understood and Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge that any cost estimates, projections or other
predictions, any data, any financial information or any memoranda or offering
materials or presentations provided or addressed to Parent or Merger Sub are
not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations and warranties
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Article IV_ (as modified by the
Company Disclosure Schedule) or in any certificate delivered hereunder, Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, to the Companys express disavowal and disclaimer of any

projection, forecast or other information that may have been or may be
provided to Parent or Merger Sub by any director, officer, employee, agent,

In furtherance of the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, Parent and

77

    

 Companys Subsidiaries either before or after the Closing Date. Parent

provided solely for the convenience of Parent to facilitate its own
independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections or forecasts,
(iii) Parent is familiar with such uncertainties and (iv) Parent is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy

Subsidiaries, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements or any other matter, including any implied
warranties of merchantability and implied warranties of fitness for a
particular purpose, is or has been made.

(d) Nothing herein shall be construed to limit a Partys right to seek
recovery against another Person for an actual, intentional, willful and
fraudulent misrepresentation of a representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement (and not with respect to any other matters) made solely by such
other Person that constitutes actual common law fraud (and not constructive
fraud or negligent misrepresentation); provided that such actual, intentional,
willful and fraudulent misrepresentation of such Person specifically excludes
any statement, representation or omission made negligently or recklessly and
shall only be deemed to exist if (i) such Person had actual knowledge that the
misrepresentations made by such Person were actually inaccurate when made,
(ii) that such misrepresentations were made with the express intent to induce
a Party to this Agreement to rely thereon (or with the expectation that such
Party would rely thereon) and that such Party would take action or inaction to
such Partys detriment and (iii) such action or inaction resulted in actual
damages to such Party. For the avoidance of doubt, no Person shall be liable
for, or as a result of, any other Persons actual, intentional, willful and

or interpretation.

(j) A reference to "made available to Parent", "provided to" (or other
similar constructs herein) means that such information, document or material
was made available for review by Parent or Parents Representatives in the
virtual data room hosted by Merrill Corporation and maintained by the Company

Section 10.9 _Company Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and disclosures
contained therein relate to and qualify certain of the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations made by the Company in this Agreement
and shall not be construed or otherwise deemed to constitute, any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company or any other
Person except to the extent explicitly provided in this Agreement or in the
Company Disclosure Schedule and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the
scope or effect of any of such representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations other than as expressly set forth therein. No reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be construed as an admission or indication, in and of itself, that such
item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance,
that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, or that such item or other matter is required to be referred
to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only. No reference in the
Company Disclosure Schedule to any agreement or document, in and of itself,
shall be construed as an admission or indication that such agreement or
document is enforceable or currently in effect or that there are any
obligations remaining to be performed or any rights that may be exercised
under such agreement or document (other than as expressly set forth on
_Section 4.17(a)_ of the Company 

 



84

    

 Disclosure Schedule). No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule
relating to any possible breach or violation of, or non-compliance with, any
agreement, law or regulation, in and of itself, shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach, violation or non-compliance
exists or has actually occurred, and nothing in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall constitute an admission of any liability or obligation of
any Person to any other Person or shall confer or give any third party any
remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or any other right
whatsoever. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that
such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary
course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or
the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this
Agreement or included in the Company Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections in
this Agreement and any items or matters set forth in one section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds
and each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent the
relevance of such items or matters to such other Section or subsection of
this Agreement is reasonably apparent on its face. The inclusion of any cross-
references to any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or
the failure to include such cross-references, shall not be deemed to mean
that the relevance of any disclosure is not reasonably apparent for the
purposes of the immediately preceding sentence. The headings contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedule are included for convenience and reference only,
and are not intended to limit the effect of the disclosures contained in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or to expand, modify or influence the scope of the
information required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) The information contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule is
confidential, proprietary information of the Company, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall be obligated to maintain and protect such confidential information
pursuant to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. In disclosing
the information in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company expressly
does not waive any attorney-client privilege or other similar privilege
associated with such information or any protection afforded by the work-
product doctrine or other similar doctrine with respect to any of the matters
disclosed or discussed herein.

Section 10.10 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed and delivered by,
(a) prior to Closing, the Company (with the consent of the Securityholder
Representative) and (b) after Closing, the Securityholder Representative, on
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the
benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting
such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 8.3(d)_,
_Section 10.2(c)_, _Section 10.3_, this _Section 10.10_ and the proviso to
_Section 10.12_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, modification, waived or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of

 



85

    

 any of the foregoing provisions) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that is materially adverse to a Debt Financing Related
Party, as applicable, without the prior written consent of the applicable
Debt Financing Sources.

Section 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile or email in Portable Document
Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one
and the same agreement.

Section 10.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns except
(a) as set forth in _Section 6.7_, _Section 10.15_, and _Section 10.16_,
(b) for the right of the Company on behalf of the Equity Holders to pursue
damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic benefits
of the Merger, including _Article III_ , and injunctive or other equitable
relief to the Equity Holders) in the event the Effective Time has not
occurred as a result of Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement
(whether or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
but subject to the provisions of  _Sections 8.3(c)_ and _(d)_ ); _provided_ ,
that the rights granted pursuant to this clause (b) shall only be enforceable
on behalf of such Equity Holders by the Company in its sole and absolute
discretion or (c) following the Effective Time, if Parent shall not have made
the payments required by it to be made in accordance with _Article III_ , the
right of each Equity Holder to enforce directly its right to receive the
amounts payable pursuant to _Article III_  (only when and if due and payable
hereunder), each of which rights set forth in clauses (a), (b) and(c) hereof
are hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub.
Except as provided in the foregoing sentence, nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Debt Financing Sources may enforce on behalf
of the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties (and each is an intended third
party beneficiary of) the provisions of _Section 8.3(d)_, _Section 10.2(c)_,
_Section 10.3_, the last sentence of _Section 10.10_ and this proviso to
_Section 10.12_, in each case, as they relate to such parties.

Section 10.13 _Remedies_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of
them hereunder to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that, subject to the terms of this  _Section
10.13_, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of the other (as applicable) under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, breaches that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, make the Financing (or the proceeds thereof)
unavailable or otherwise result in an inability of Parent and Merger Sub to
fund the Required Payments), without proof of actual damages or inadequacy
of legal remedy and without

 



86

    

 bond or other security being required. The parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that (subject to the terms of this _Section 10.13_)
prior to the Closing, the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure
breaches of this Agreement by the other Parties and to cause the other Parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the
Closing in accordance with _Section 2.2_, on the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth herein, the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance (or receive a grant thereof) of Parents obligation to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby if, but
only if, (i) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_
and  _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of
being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance
with this Agreement, (ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (iii)
proceeds of the full amount of the Debt Financing (after giving effect to any
reduction in the amount of the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, including
as a result of any Permanent Financing, Equity Financing or Asset Sale) have
been funded or are available to be funded at the Closing, and (iv) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that, if specific
performance is granted and Parent were to fund the Required Payments, then the
Closing will occur. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that (x) the party seeking the injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, while
the Company may concurrently seek, as alternative remedies, (i) specific
performance or other equitable relief, subject in all respects to the
conditions set forth in this _Section 10.13_ and (ii) payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or monetary damages, if, as and when required pursuant to
this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive (1) both a grant of specific performance to cause the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
other equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or monetary damages, on the other hand, or (2) both payment of
any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee (and the reimbursement of expenses owing to the Company
pursuant to _Section 6.9(c)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_, if applicable)), on the
other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto further agree that
(i) by seeking the equitable remedies provided for in this _Section 10.13_,
a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek at any time any other
form of relief that may be available to a party in accordance with this
Agreement, subject to the limitations set forth herein (including in this
_Section 10.13_ and in _Section 8.3_), in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the equitable remedies provided for in
this _Section 10.13_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and
(ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 10.13_ shall require any party hereto
to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 10.13_ prior or as
a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ (and
pursuing monetary damages or the Parent Termination Fee (and any of the other
amounts, as and when due, owing to the Company pursuant to _Section 6.9(c)_
and _Section 8.3(e)_) in any case, subject to the limitations set forth
therein) after such termination to the extent permitted in accordance with
this Agreement), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant
to this _Section 10.13_ or anything set forth in this _Section 10.13_
restrict or limit

 



87

    

 any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies otherwise available under this
Agreement, in each case subject to the limitations set forth herein
(including in this _Section 10.13_ and in _Section 8.3_).

Section 10.14  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof.

Section 10.15 _Securityholder Representative_.

(a) Pursuant to the adoption of this Agreement by Company Common Stockholders
representing greater than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, each Equity Holder will be deemed to have irrevocably appointed,
authorized and empowered the Securityholder Representative to act as a
representative for the benefit of each Equity Holder as the exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact with the power and authority to act on behalf of each
Equity Holder in connection with the Merger, which shall include the power and
authority as is necessary to carry out the functions assigned to
the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Securityholder Representative shall have no obligation to
the Equity Holders to act, except as expressly provided herein, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Securityholder Representative
shall have the power and authority to:

(i) execute and deliver on behalf of the Equity Holders such waivers and
consents in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including any amendments or modifications to
this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, in each case as the
Securityholder Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or
desirable;

 

(ii) enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Equity Holders
following the Effective Time and to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of the Securityholder Representative arising out of or under or in
any manner relating to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and
the other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby or the Merger and
other transactions provided for herein or therein, and to take any and all
actions which the Securityholder Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements for and
on behalf of the Equity Holders following the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, following the Effective Time, the
Securityholder Representative may (A) assert any claim or institute any
Action, (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Action initiated by
Parent or any other Person, or by any Governmental Entity against the
Securityholder Representative or any of the Equity Holders, (C) receive
process on behalf of any or all Equity Holders in any such Action
and compromise or settle on such terms as it shall determine to be
appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any
such Action, (D) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as it may deem
advisable or necessary and (E) file and prosecute appeals

 



88

    

 from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any such Action (it being
understood that the Securityholder Representative shall not have any
obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any
failure to take any such actions);

(iii) refrain from enforcing any right of the Equity Holders, arising out of
or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or the other documents
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on
the part of the Securityholder Representative, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, shall be deemed a
waiver of any such right or interest by the Securityholder Representative or
by the Equity Holders unless such waiver is in writing signed by the
waiving party or by the Securityholder Representative;

(iv) on behalf of the Equity Holders, make, execute, acknowledge and deliver
all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements,
notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other
writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all
action that the Securityholder Representative, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with
the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, and all other agreements, documents or instruments
referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and
therewith;

 

(v) give and receive all notices and communications to be given or received by
the Equity Holders under this Agreement and to receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, including service of process in connection with any arbitration;
and

 

(vi) on behalf of the Equity Holders (including by means of establishing an
escrow account or similar account funded by the Equity Holders), make or
receive any payments or to pay any expenses under or in connection with this
Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements or on behalf of the Equity
Holders, including to satisfy costs, expenses or liabilities of
the Securityholder Representative in connection with matters related to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements (provided, that, no such costs,
expenses or liabilities shall be paid from the Escrow Account other than when
and if expressly permitted in accordance with _Section 3.6(e) and Section
3.6(f))_.

(b) Parent may rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Securityholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally
binding upon the Equity Holders.

 

(c) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Equity Holder and (ii) shall survive the Merger and the
consummation of other transactions contemplated hereby and by the other
Transaction Agreements.

 



89

    

(d) All actions taken by the Securityholder Representative under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall be binding upon all
Equity Holders and their respective successors and assigns as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. Parent shall serve notice
to, and deal exclusively with, the Securityholder Representative with respect
to any and all matters concerning any of the Equity Holders arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements and all other
agreements or instruments contemplated hereby or thereby or the Merger and
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document purported by the Securityholder Representative to have been executed
by or on behalf of any of the Equity Holders as fully binding upon them. If
the Securityholder Representative shall resign, dissolve, cease to exist or
otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as representative of the
Equity Holders, the Equity Holders shall, within ten days after the
occurrence of such event, appoint (by majority vote or written consent of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock) a successor representative and,
promptly thereafter, shall notify the Equity Holders and Parent of the
identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed to the rights and
obligations of the Securityholder Representative as representative of the
Equity Holders hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholder
Representative at any time, all references herein or in any other agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby to the Securityholder Representative in which
the Securityholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Equity Holders shall be deemed to refer to the Equity Holders holding a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Each Equity Holder
upon the execution of a Letter of Transmittal, agrees that any action taken by
the Securityholder Representative on its behalf pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the other agreements and
instruments contemplated hereby and thereby, including all actions and
inactions permitted by this  _Section 10.15_ and _Section 9.3_, shall be
fully binding on them.

(e) By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each Equity Holder
irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
liability to any Equity Holder with respect to actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative and that
the Securityholder Representative shall be under no obligation to take any
action in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative, unless the
Securityholder Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in the sole determination of Securityholder
Representative, are sufficient to protect the Securityholder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Securityholder Representative in responding to such direction or taking such
action. By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each Equity Holder
irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder Representative shall be
entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as
it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and
performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part
of the Securityholder Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely
on the opinions and advice of such persons. Without limiting _Section
10.15(a)(vi)_, by the execution of a Letter of Transmittal each Equity Holder
irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder Representative shall be
entitled to reimbursement for all expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Securityholder Representative in such capacity,
and shall be entitled to indemnification 

 



90

    

 from the Equity Holders against any loss, liability or expenses arising out
of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Securityholder
Representative (except for those arising out of Securityholder
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs
and expenses of investigation and defense of claims. The Equity Holders will
indemnify the Securityholder Representative in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence on a pro rata basis based on their
respective equity interest in the Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section
10.15(e)_ are contemplated in the determination of the Base Merger
Consideration and the Equity Holders agree that no additional consideration
shall be required for the enforceability of the terms herein.

 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the Securityholder Representatives
obligations under this _Section 10.15_ are solely as a representative of the
Equity Holders and that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
personal responsibility or liability for any expenses, costs or other
liabilities incurred by it in such capacity.

 

Section 10.16 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith (other than the Letters of Transmittal), by its acceptance
of the benefits of this Agreement, each Party hereto covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than the Parties hereto have any
liabilities, obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether
contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the equity
holders of the Parties or their respective managing members or general
partners may be partnerships or limited liability companies, none of the
Parties hereto has any right of recovery under this Agreement, or any claim
based on such liabilities, obligations, commitments against, and no personal
liability shall attach to, the former, current or future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers or general or limited partners of any of the Parties or any
former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate or agent of
any of the foregoing (collectively, but not including the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub, each a " _Non-Recourse Party_ "), through any of the Parties or
otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of any such Party against any Non-Recourse
Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or Law, or otherwise. Without
limiting the foregoing, no claim will be brought or maintained by Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective successors
or permitted assigns against any Non-Recourse Party that is not otherwise
expressly identified as a party to this Agreement, and no recourse will be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach or nonperformance of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any party hereto set
forth or contained in this Agreement, any exhibit or schedule hereto, any
other document contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument, opinion,
agreement or other document of the Company or any other Person delivered
hereunder.

 

Section 10.17 _Representation_. Parent agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf
of each of Merger Sub and their respective directors, officers, managers,
employees and Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP (" _Simpson Thacher_ ") may serve as counsel to the Equity
Holders and their Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this
Agreement and the contemplated transactions, including any litigation, claim
or obligation arising

 



91

    

 out of or relating to this Agreement or the contemplated transactions
notwithstanding any representation by Simpson Thacher prior to the Closing
Date of the Company. Parent and the Company hereby (a) waive any claim they
have or may have that Simpson Thacher has a conflict of interest or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agree that,
in the event that a dispute arises either before or after the Closing between
Parent and any of the Equity Holders or any of their respective Affiliates,
Simpson Thacher may represent the Equity Holders or any of their respective
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may
be directly adverse to Parent or the Company and even though Simpson Thacher
may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute. Parent and the Company also further agree that, as to all
communications prior to Closing among Simpson Thacher and the Company, the
Equity Holders or the Equity Holders Affiliates and Representatives, that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Equity
Holders and may be controlled by the Equity Holders and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Parent or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Company and a third party
other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Simpson Thacher to such third party; provided, however, that
the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
the Securityholder Representative.
