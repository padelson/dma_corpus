Section&nbsp;5.7 and any other liabilities of Seller to the extent Buyer receives a credit therefor

Wachovia Bank NA or another bank reasonably satisfactory to Seller (the &#147;Issuing Bank&#148;) in the
stated amount and in the form of <I>Exhibit&nbsp;A </I>hereto. The L/C shall be without draw conditions other
than presentation to the Issuing Bank of a draw certificate (which may contain a statement that
Seller is entitled to draw under the terms of this Agreement), and shall have an expiry date of not
less than one year after the date hereof (and otherwise in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Seller). If the L/C is not extended prior to the date one month before its expiry date, then
Seller may present the L/C to the Issuing Bank and draw the entire stated amount and such proceeds
shall be held by Seller as a cash deposit.

Price. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.1(c), the Deposit, (i)&nbsp;if
cash, shall be retained by Seller, or (ii)&nbsp;if an L/C, Seller shall present the L/C to the Issuing
Bank and draw the entire stated amount thereof. Any such retention or payment to Seller shall be
credited as partial payment of liquidated damages under Section&nbsp;10.5. If this Agreement is
terminated for any other reason, the Deposit, (i)&nbsp;if cash, shall be disbursed to Buyer, or (ii)&nbsp;if
an L/C, the L/C shall be returned to Buyer.

hereof constitutes a material default as to which the Cure Period under Section&nbsp;10.1 does not apply
entitling Seller to immediately terminate this Agreement.

services assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.1(d), if at Closing the Station has an aggregate
negative or positive barter balance (<I>i.e</I>., the amount by which the value of air time to be provided
by the Station after the Effective Time exceeds, or conversely, is less than, the fair market value
of corresponding goods and services), there shall be no proration or adjustment, unless the
negative or positive barter balance of the Station as an aggregate exceeds $50,000, in which event
such excess or deficiency, as the case may be, shall be treated either as prepaid time sales or a
receivable of Seller, and adjusted for as a proration in Buyer&#146;s or Seller&#146;s favor, as applicable.
In determining barter balances, the value of air time shall be based upon Seller&#146;s rates as of
Closing, and corresponding goods and services shall include those to be received by the Station
after Closing <I>plus </I>those received by the Station before Closing to the extent conveyed by Seller to
Buyer as a part of the Station Assets.

provide Buyer with a statement setting forth a reasonably detailed computation of Seller&#146;s
reasonable and good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount (defined below) as of Closing (the
&#147;Preliminary Adjustment Report&#148;). As used herein, the &#147;Adjustment Amount&#148; means the net amount by
which the Purchase Price is to be increased or decreased in accordance with this Section&nbsp;1.7. If
the Adjustment Amount reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a credit to Buyer, then the
Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the preliminary Adjustment
Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a charge to
Buyer, then the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such
preliminary Adjustment Amount. For a period of ninety (90)&nbsp;days after Closing, Seller and its
auditors and Buyer and its auditors may review the Preliminary Adjustment Report and the related
books and records of Seller with respect to the Station, and Buyer and Seller will in good faith
seek to reach agreement on the final Adjustment Amount. If agreement is reached within such 90-day
period, then promptly thereafter Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as the
case may be, an amount equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;the agreed Adjustment Amount and (ii)
the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report. If agreement is
not reached within such 90-day period, then the dispute resolutions of Section&nbsp;1.7(d) shall apply.

specified in Section&nbsp;1.7(c), then Seller and Buyer shall select an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing (the &#147;Arbitrating Firm&#148;) to resolve the disputed items. If Seller and
Buyer do not agree on the Arbitrating Firm within five (5)&nbsp;calendar days after the end of such
90-day period, then the Arbitrating Firm shall be a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Seller and one firm designated by
Buyer). Buyer and Seller shall each inform the Arbitrating Firm in

positions with respect to the Adjustment Amount, and each shall make available to the Arbitrating
Firm any books and records and work papers relevant to the preparation of the Arbitrating Firm&#146;s
computation of the Adjustment Amount. The Arbitrating Firm shall be instructed to complete its
analysis within thirty (30)&nbsp;days from the date of its engagement and upon completion to inform the
parties in writing of its own determination of the Adjustment Amount, the basis for its
determination and whether its determination is within the Mid-Range (defined below) or if not,
whether it is closer to Buyer&#146;s or Seller&#146;s written determination of the Adjustment Amount. Any
determination by the Arbitrating Firm in accordance with this Section shall be final and binding on
the parties. Within five (5)&nbsp;calendar days after the Arbitrating Firm delivers to the parties its
written determination of the Adjustment Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer shall pay to
Seller, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;the Adjustment Amount as

Preliminary Adjustment Report.

then Seller and Buyer shall each pay one-half of the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm
in connection with its analysis. If not, then (i)&nbsp;if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the
written position of Buyer concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then
Seller shall pay the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its
analysis, or (ii)&nbsp;if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Seller concerning
the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Buyer shall pay the fees and
disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis. As used herein, the term
&#147;Mid-Range&#148; means a range that (i)&nbsp;equals twenty percent (20%) of the absolute difference between
the written positions of Buyer and Seller as to the Adjustment Amount and (ii)&nbsp;has a midpoint equal
to the average of such written positions of Buyer and Seller.

accordance with the respective fair market values of the Station Assets and the goodwill being
purchased and sold in accordance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;1060 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). Buyer and Seller shall file its federal income tax returns and
its other tax returns reflecting the allocation made pursuant to this Section.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9. <U>Closing</U>. The consummation of the sale and purchase of the Station Assets
provided for in this Agreement (the &#147;Closing&#148;) shall take place on the fifth business day after the
date of the FCC Consent pursuant to the FCC&#146;s initial order (or on such earlier day after such
consent as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Articles 6 or 7 below. The date on which the Closing is to occur is
referred to herein as the &#147;Closing Date.&#148; Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is a
banking moratorium or suspension of payments in respect of banks by federal authorities on the
scheduled Closing Date, then Closing shall be delayed until the first business day after which such
moratorium is lifted or federal authorities permit payments to be accepted at banks.

under this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller&#146;s recovery of such amount shall
constitute payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty and that Seller&#146;s liquidated damages
amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by
Buyer&#146;s material breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss and
damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the
value of the transactions to be consummated hereunder.
