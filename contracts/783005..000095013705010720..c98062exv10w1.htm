 1.3. _Shared Assets_. 

  

 (a) Some of the Station Contracts may be used by Seller or affiliates of Seller in the operation of multiple stations or other business units (the "Shared Contracts") and are identified as such on _Schedule 1.1(d)_. The rights and obligations under the Shared Contracts shall be equitably allocated among stations in a manner reasonably determined by Seller in accordance with the following equitable allocation principles: 

   

 (i) any allocation set forth in the Shared Contract shall control; 

  

 (ii) if none, then any allocation previously made by Seller in the ordinary course of Station operations shall control; 

  

 (iii) if none, then the quantifiable proportionate benefit to be received by the parties after Closing shall control; and 

  

 (iv) if not quantifiable, then reasonable accommodation shall control. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall cooperate with Seller (and any third party designated by Seller) in such allocation, and the Station Contracts (and Assumed Obligations (defined below)) will include only Buyers allocated portion of the rights and obligations under the Shared Contracts (without need for further action and whether such allocation occurs before or after Closing). If designated by Seller, such allocation will occur by termination of the Shared Contract and execution of new contracts. Buyers allocated portion of the Shared Contracts will not include any group discounts or similar benefits specific to Seller or its affiliates. Completion of documentation of any such allocation is not a condition to Closing.   ##### 

  

  

   

 1.4. _Assumption of Obligations_. On the Closing Date (defined below), Buyer shall assume the obligations of Seller arising during, or attributable to, any period of time on or after the Closing Date under the Station Contracts and the FCC Licenses, the obligations described in Section 5.7 and any other liabilities of Seller to the extent Buyer receives a credit therefor under Section 1.7 (collectively, the "Assumed Obligations"). Except for the Assumed Obligations, Buyer does not assume, and will not be deemed by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to have assumed, any other liabilities or obligations of Seller (the "Retained Obligations"). 

  

 1.5. _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the sale of the Station Assets to Buyer, at Closing Buyer shall pay Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of One Hundred Eighty-Six Million Dollars ($186,000,000), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.7 (the "Purchase Price"). 

  

 1.6. _Deposit_. 

  

 (a) Within one (1) business day of the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall make a deposit (the "Deposit") by delivering to Seller (as beneficiary) a letter of credit (the "L/C") issued by Wachovia Bank NA or another bank reasonably satisfactory to Seller (the "Issuing Bank") in the stated amount and in the form of _Exhibit A _hereto. The L/C shall be without draw conditions other than presentation to the Issuing Bank of a draw certificate (which may contain a statement that Seller is entitled to draw under the terms of this Agreement), and shall have an expiry date of not less than one year after the date hereof (and otherwise in a form reasonably satisfactory to Seller). If the L/C is not extended prior to the date one month before its expiry date, then Seller may present the L/C to the Issuing Bank and draw the entire stated amount and such proceeds shall be held by Seller as a cash deposit. 

   

 (b) At Closing, the Deposit, (i) if cash, shall be retained by Seller and applied to the Purchase Price, or (ii) if an L/C, the L/C shall be returned to Buyer upon payment of the Purchase Price. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(c), the Deposit, (i) if cash, shall be retained by Seller, or (ii) if an L/C, Seller shall present the L/C to the Issuing Bank and draw the entire stated amount thereof. Any such retention or payment to Seller shall be credited as partial payment of liquidated damages under Section 10.5. If this Agreement is terminated for any other reason, the Deposit, (i) if cash, shall be disbursed to Buyer, or (ii) if an L/C, the L/C shall be returned to Buyer. 

   

 (c) Any failure by Buyer to deliver the L/C to Seller within one (1) business day of the date hereof constitutes a material default as to which the Cure Period under Section 10.1 does not apply entitling Seller to immediately terminate this Agreement. 

   

 1.7. _Prorations and Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) All prepaid and deferred income and expenses relating to the Station Assets and arising from the operation of the Station shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") as of 12:01 a.m. on the day of Closing (the "Effective Time"). Such prorations shall include without limitation all ad valorem, real estate and other property taxes (except transfer taxes as provided by Section 11.1), music and other license fees, employee performance incentives set forth in 

     ##### 

  

    

employment agreements or annual compensation plans, any vacation for
Transferred Employees (defined below) (except accruals for the fiscal year of
Seller in which Closing occurs for which there shall be no
adjustment), utility expenses, rent and other amounts under Station Contracts
and similar prepaid and deferred items. Seller shall receive a credit for all
of the Stations deposits and prepaid expenses. Sales commissions related to
the sale of advertisements broadcast on the Station prior to the Effective
Time shall be the responsibility of Seller, and sales commissions related to
the sale of advertisements broadcast on the Station after the Effective Time
shall be the responsibility of Buyer. 

   

 (b) With respect to trade, barter or similar agreements for the sale of time for goods or services assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.1(d), if at Closing the Station has an aggregate negative or positive barter balance ( _i.e_., the amount by which the value of air time to be provided by the Station after the Effective Time exceeds, or conversely, is less than, the fair market value of corresponding goods and services), there shall be no proration or adjustment, unless the negative or positive barter balance of the Station as an aggregate exceeds $50,000, in which event such excess or deficiency, as the case may be, shall be treated either as prepaid time sales or a receivable of Seller, and adjusted for as a proration in Buyers or Sellers favor, as applicable. In determining barter balances, the value of air time shall be based upon Sellers rates as of Closing, and corresponding goods and services shall include those to be received by the Station after Closing _plus_ those received by the Station before Closing to the extent conveyed by Seller to Buyer as a part of the Station Assets. 

   

 (c) No later than three (3) business days prior to the scheduled Closing date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth a reasonably detailed computation of Sellers reasonable and good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount (defined below) as of Closing (the "Preliminary Adjustment Report"). As used herein, the "Adjustment Amount" means the net amount by which the Purchase Price is to be increased or decreased in accordance with this Section 1.7. If the Adjustment Amount reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a credit to Buyer, then the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the preliminary Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount reflected on the Preliminary Adjustment Report is a charge to Buyer, then the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such preliminary Adjustment Amount. For a period of ninety (90) days after Closing, Seller and its auditors and Buyer and its auditors may review the Preliminary Adjustment Report and the related books and records of Seller with respect to the Station, and Buyer and Seller will in good faith seek to reach agreement on the final Adjustment Amount. If agreement is reached within such 90-day period, then promptly thereafter Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference between (i) the agreed Adjustment Amount and (ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report. If agreement is not reached within such 90-day period, then the dispute resolutions of Section 1.7(d) shall apply. 

   

 (d) If the parties do not reach an agreement on the Adjustment Amount within the 90-day period specified in Section 1.7(c), then Seller and Buyer shall select an independent accounting firm of recognized national standing (the "Arbitrating Firm") to resolve the disputed items. If Seller and Buyer do not agree on the Arbitrating Firm within five (5) calendar days after the end of such 90-day period, then the Arbitrating Firm shall be a nationally recognized independent accounting firm selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Seller and one firm designated by Buyer). Buyer and Seller shall each inform the Arbitrating Firm in 

    ##### 

  

    

writing as to their respective positions with respect to the Adjustment
Amount, and each shall make available to the Arbitrating Firm any books and
records and work papers relevant to the preparation of the Arbitrating
Firms computation of the Adjustment Amount. The Arbitrating Firm shall be
instructed to complete its analysis within thirty (30) days from the date of
its engagement and upon completion to inform the parties in writing of its
own determination of the Adjustment Amount, the basis for its determination
and whether its determination is within the Mid-Range (defined below) or if
not, whether it is closer to Buyers or Sellers written determination of the
Adjustment Amount. Any determination by the Arbitrating Firm in accordance
with this Section shall be final and binding on the parties. Within five (5)
calendar days after the Arbitrating Firm delivers to the parties its written
determination of the Adjustment Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer
shall pay to Seller, as the case may be, an amount equal to the difference
between (i) the Adjustment Amount as determined by the Arbitrating Firm and
(ii) the preliminary Adjustment Amount indicated in the Preliminary
Adjustment Report. 

   

 (e) If the Arbitrating Firms determination of the Adjustment Amount is within the Mid-Range, then Seller and Buyer shall each pay one-half of the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis. If not, then (i) if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Buyer concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Seller shall pay the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis, or (ii) if the Arbitrating Firm determines that the written position of Seller concerning the Adjustment Amount is closer to its own determination, then Buyer shall pay the fees and disbursements of the Arbitrating Firm in connection with its analysis. As used herein, the term "Mid-Range" means a range that (i) equals twenty percent (20%) of the absolute difference between the written positions of Buyer and Seller as to the Adjustment Amount and (ii) has a midpoint equal to the average of such written positions of Buyer and Seller. 

   

 (f) All payments to be made under Section 1.7 shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account of the payee at a financial institution in the United States and shall for all purposes constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

   

 1.8. _Allocation_. After Closing, Buyer and Seller will allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with the respective fair market values of the Station Assets and the goodwill being purchased and sold in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Buyer and Seller shall file its federal income tax returns and its other tax returns reflecting the allocation made pursuant to this Section. 

  

 1.9. _Closing_. The consummation of the sale and purchase of the Station Assets provided for in this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the fifth business day after the date of the FCC Consent pursuant to the FCCs initial order (or on such earlier day after such consent as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles 6 or 7 below. The date on which the Closing is to occur is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is a banking moratorium or suspension of payments in respect of banks by federal authorities on the scheduled Closing Date, then Closing shall be delayed until the first business day after which such moratorium is lifted or federal authorities permit payments to be accepted at banks. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.10. _Governmental Consents_. 

  

 (a) Within five (5) business days of the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall file an application with the FCC (the "FCC Application") requesting FCC consent to the assignment of the FCC Licenses to Buyer. FCC consent to the assignment of the main station FCC Licenses to Buyer without any material adverse conditions other than those of general applicability is referred to herein as the "FCC Consent." Buyer and Seller shall diligently prosecute the FCC Application and otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as soon as possible. 

   

 (b) If applicable, within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall make any required filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a request for early termination of the waiting period thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for additional information or documentation. Expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as "HSR Clearance." 

   

 (c) Buyer and Seller shall notify each other of all documents filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall furnish each other with such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any governmental filing hereunder. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are referred to herein collectively as the "Governmental Consents."

 (f) except in the ordinary course of business and as otherwise required by law, (i) not enter into any employment, labor, or union agreement or plan (or amendments of any such existing agreements or plan) that will be binding upon Buyer after Closing or (ii) increase the compensation payable to any employee of the Station, except for bonuses and other compensation payable by Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and   ##### 

  

  

   

 (g) not, other than in the ordinary course of business, enter into new Station Contracts or amend any existing Station Contracts. 

   

ARTICLE 5: _JOINT COVENANTS_  

   

 Buyer and Seller hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

  

 5.1. _Confidentiality_. Seller (or The Blackstone Group, LLC on behalf of Seller) and Buyer (or an affiliate of Buyer on behalf of Buyer) are parties to a non-disclosure agreement with respect to Seller and its television stations (the "NDA"). To the extent not already a direct party thereto, Seller and Buyer hereby assume the NDA and agree to be bound by the provisions thereof. Without limiting the terms of the NDA, subject to the requirements of applicable law, all non-public information regarding the parties and their business and properties that is disclosed in connection with the negotiation, preparation or performance of this Agreement (including without limitation all financial information provided by Seller to Buyer) shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any other person or entity, except in accordance with the terms of the NDA. 

  

 5.2. _Announcements_. Prior to Closing, no party shall, without the prior written consent of the other, issue any press release or make any other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such party is so obligated by law, in which case such party shall give advance notice to the other. 

  

 5.3. _Control_. Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise or direct the operation of the Station prior to Closing. Consistent with the Communications Act and the FCC rules and regulations, control, supervision and direction of the operation of the Station prior to Closing shall remain the responsibility of Seller as the holder of the FCC Licenses. 

  

 5.4. _Risk of Loss_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall bear the risk of any loss of or damage to any of the Station Assets at all times until the Effective Time, and Buyer shall bear the risk of any such loss or damage thereafter. 

   

 (b) If prior to the Effective Time any item of Tangible Personal Property is damaged or destroyed or otherwise not in the condition described in Section 2.6 in any material respect, then: 

   

 (i) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such loss and use commercially reasonable efforts to repair or replace such item in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, 

  

 (ii) Sellers representations and warranties, and Buyers pre-Closing termination rights and post-Closing indemnification rights, are hereby modified to take into account any such condition, and 

  

 (iii) if such repair or replacement is not completed prior to Closing, then as Buyers sole remedy, the parties shall proceed to Closing and Seller shall repair or replace 

   ##### 

  

 

such item in all material respects after Closing (and Buyer will provide
Seller access and any other reasonable assistance requested by Seller with
respect to such obligation). 

   

 (c) If prior to Closing, except for any DTV signal operating under Special Temporary Authority, the Station is off the air or operating at power levels that result in a material reduction in coverage (a "Broadcast Interruption"), then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to return the Station to the air and restore prior coverage as promptly as practicable in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if on the day otherwise scheduled for Closing, there is a Broadcast Interruption of the Station (excluding translators and auxiliaries) that results in a material reduction in coverage, then Closing shall be postponed until the date five (5) business days after the Station returns to the air and prior coverage is restored in all material respects, subject to Section 10.1. 

   

 5.5. _Environmental_. 

  

 (a) Seller has provided Buyer with copies of Phase I environmental assessments of certain Real Property sites as shown on _Schedule 1.1(c)_, if any (each a "Phase I"). 

   

 (b) Such assessments identified the items set forth on _Schedule 1.1(c)_. With respect to such items and any other items or conditions identified in any Phase I or in any further assessments, testing or analysis of such Real Property sites done in connection herewith that identifies a condition that requires remediation in order for the Station to operate in compliance with applicable environmental law in all material respects: 

   

 (i) except as set forth below, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate such items or conditions in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, 

  

 (ii) Sellers representations and warranties, and Buyers pre-Closing termination rights and post-Closing indemnification rights, are hereby modified to take into account any such items or conditions, and 

  

 (iii) if such remediation is not completed prior to Closing, then as Buyers sole remedy, the parties shall proceed to Closing and Seller shall remediate such conditions or items in all material respects after Closing (and Buyer will provide Seller access and any other reasonable assistance requested by Seller with respect to such obligation). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the reasonably estimated cost to remedy such items or conditions in the aggregate exceeds $500,000, then Seller may terminate this Agreement prior to Closing upon written notice to Buyer. 

   

 5.6. _Consents_. 

  

 (a) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) any third party consents necessary for the assignment of any Station Contract (which shall not require any payment to any such third party), and (ii) execution of reasonable estoppel certificates by lessors under any Real Property Leases requiring consent to assignment (if any), but no such consents or estoppel certificates are conditions to Closing except for the Required Consents (defined below). Receipt of consent to assign to Buyer the Stations network affiliation 

    ##### 

  

    

agreement designated with a diamond on _Schedule 1.1(d) _and the Stations
main tower leases designated with a diamond on _Schedule 1.1(c)_ (if any) is
a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to close under this Agreement
(the "Required Consents"). 

   

 (b) To the extent that any Station Contract may not be assigned without the consent of any third party, and such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, this Agreement and any assignment executed pursuant to this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment of such Station Contract; provided, however, with respect to each such Station Contract, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to the extent feasible in effecting a lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement under which Buyer shall receive the benefits under the Station Contract from and after Closing, and to the extent of the benefits received, Buyer shall pay and perform Sellers obligations arising under the Station Contract from and after Closing in accordance with its terms. 

   

 5.7. _Employees_. 

  

 (a) For a period of two (2) years from the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, solicit for employment, induce or attempt to induce to leave Sellers or an affiliate of Sellers employ, or hire, any employees of Seller or its affiliates staffed in Sellers Indianapolis headquarters or at any other television station owned by Seller or its affiliates (other than general solicitations not directed solely to any such employees). 

   

 (b) Seller has provided Buyer a list showing employee positions and annualized pay rates for employees of the Station. Buyer shall offer employment to all persons employed by Seller immediately prior to Closing (including any hired after the date hereof, provided that such employee is hired in the ordinary course of business) upon substantially the same terms and conditions and with substantially the same duties and benefits as in effect immediately preceding the Closing, including but not limited to wages, salaries, commission rate (if applicable) and target bonuses (all determined on a cash basis before taking into account Sellers stock compensation program). With respect to each employee who accepts such offer (collectively, the "Transferred Employees"), at Closing employment with Seller shall terminate and employment with Buyer shall commence, and Buyer shall retain each such employee on such terms for a period of not less than one (1) year after Closing, unless terminated for cause. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall be responsible for any applicable severance in accordance with Sellers severance policy (a copy of which has been provided to Buyer). 

   

 (c) With respect to Transferred Employees, Seller shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits arising prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits arising after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall grant credit to each Transferred Employee for all unused vacation accrued as of the Effective Time as an employee of Seller, and Buyer shall assume and discharge Sellers obligation to provide such leave to such employees (such obligations being a part of the Assumed Obligations). 

   

 (d) Buyer shall permit Transferred Employees (and their spouses and dependents) to participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" (including without limitation health insurance plans) and "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) and 

    ##### 

  

    

3(2) of ERISA, respectively) in which similarly situated employees are
generally eligible to participate, with coverage effective immediately upon
Closing (and without exclusion from coverage on account of any pre-
existing condition), with service with Seller deemed service with the Buyer
for purposes of any length of service requirements, waiting periods, vesting
periods and differential benefits based on length of service, and with credit
under any welfare benefit plan for any deductibles or co-payments paid
for the current plan year under any plan maintained by Seller.
Notwithstanding the above, if required by Buyers plan, no prior service with
Seller shall be credited under Buyers defined pension plan for any reason.

    

 (e) Buyer shall also permit each Transferred Employee who participates in the Sellers 401(k) plan to elect to make direct rollovers of their account balances into the Buyers 401(k) plan as of Closing, including the direct rollover of any outstanding loan balances such that they will continue to make payments under the terms of such loans under the Buyers 401(k) plan, subject to compliance with applicable law and subject to the reasonable requirements of Buyers 401(k) plan. 

   

 5.8. _Accounting Services_. 

  

 (a) For a period of ninety (90) days after Closing (the "Collection Period"), Buyer shall, without charge to Seller, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the A/R in the ordinary course of business and shall apply all amounts collected from the Stations account debtors to the oldest account first, unless the advertiser disputes in good faith in writing an older account and designates the payment to a newer account. Buyer shall not discount, adjust or otherwise compromise any A/R and Buyer shall refer any disputed A/R to Seller. Within ten calendar days after the end of each month, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a report showing A/R collections for the prior month. Within ten (10) business days after the end of the Collection Period, Buyer shall certify in writing to Seller the aggregate amount of A/R collections (the "A/R Amount"), together with a statement setting forth a reasonably detailed computation of the A/R Amount (such certificate, the "Collection Certificate"). If the A/R Amount is less than Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the "Target Amount"), then Seller shall pay Buyer such shortfall within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Collection Certificate. If the A/R Amount exceeds the Target Amount, then Buyer shall pay Seller such excess upon delivery of the Collection Certificate. Buyer shall provide Seller with such backup documentation as is reasonably requested by Seller to verify the A/R Amount, and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement about the A/R Amount promptly after the end of the Collection Period. Upon such payment, any remaining A/R shall be returned to Seller for collection. 

   

 (b) During the first fifteen (15) business days after Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller at no additional cost the services of the Stations business offices, together with reasonable access to related systems and records, for the purposes of closing the books of the Station for the period prior to Closing and of facilitating the distribution of any stock compensation from Seller to the Stations employees, all in accordance with the procedures and practices applied by the business offices for periods prior to Closing. 

   

 5.9. _1031 Exchange_. To facilitate a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, Seller may assign its rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a "qualified intermediary" under section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the treasury regulations (but such assignment shall not relieve Seller of its obligations under this Agreement) and any such qualified intermediary 

   ##### 

   

 

may re-assign to Seller; provided that no such assignment shall prevent or
delay Closing. If Seller gives notice of such assignment, Buyer shall provide
Seller with a written acknowledgment of such notice prior to Closing and pay
the Purchase Price (or such portion thereof as is designated in writing by
the qualified intermediary) to or on behalf of the qualified intermediary at
Closing and otherwise reasonably cooperate therewith.

 9.1. _Survival_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive Closing for a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date whereupon they shall expire and be of no further force or effect, except that if within such period the indemnified party gives the indemnifying party written notice of a claim for breach thereof describing in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such claim, then such claim shall survive until the earlier of resolution of such claim or expiration of the applicable statue of limitations. The covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall survive Closing until performed. 

  

 9.2. _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 9.2(b), from and after Closing, Seller, jointly and severally, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses ("Damages") incurred by Buyer arising out of or resulting from:

ARTICLE 10: _TERMINATION AND REMEDIES_  

   

 10.1. _Termination_. Subject to Section 10.3, this Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing as follows: 

  

 (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; 

   

 (b) by written notice of Buyer to Seller if Seller breaches its representations or warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or default is material in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby and is not cured within the Cure Period (defined below); 

   

 (c) by written notice of Seller to Buyer if Buyer breaches its representations or warranties or defaults in the performance of its covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or default is material in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby and is not cured within the Cure Period; provided, however, that the Cure Period shall not apply to Buyers obligations to deliver the L/C to Seller within one (1) business day of the date hereof and to pay the Purchase Price at Closing; 

   

 (d) by written notice of Seller to Buyer or Buyer to Seller if Closing does not occur by the date twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement; or 

   

 (e) as provided by Section 5.5(c). 

   

 10.2. _Cure Period_. Each party shall give the other party prompt written notice upon learning of any breach or default by the other party under this Agreement. The term "Cure Period" as used herein means a period commencing on the date Buyer or Seller receives from the other written notice of breach or default hereunder and continuing until the earlier of (i) twenty (20) calendar days thereafter or (ii) five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date; provided, however, that if the breach or default is non-monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within such period but can be cured before the date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date, and if diligent efforts to cure promptly commence, then the Cure Period shall continue as long as such diligent efforts to cure continue, but not beyond the date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.3. _Survival_. Neither party may terminate under Sections 10.1(b) or (c) if it is then in material default under this Agreement. Except as provided by Section 10.5, the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party of any liability for breach or default under this Agreement prior to the date of termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Sections 1.6 (Deposit) (and Sections 10.4 and 10.5 with respect to the Deposit), 5.1 (Confidentiality) and 11.1 (Expenses) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 10.4. _Specific Performance_. In the event of failure or threatened failure by either party to comply with the terms of this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining such failure or threatened failure and, subject to obtaining any necessary FCC consent, to enforcement of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance requiring compliance with this Agreement. 

  

 10.5. _Liquidated Damages_. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c), then Buyer shall pay Seller on demand the sum of $27,000,000 (less the amount of the Deposit actually paid to Seller pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and such payment shall constitute liquidated damages and the sole remedy of Seller under this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers recovery of such amount shall constitute payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty and that Sellers liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Buyers material breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated hereunder. 

  

ARTICLE 11: _MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 11.1. _Expenses_. Each party shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of this Agreement. All governmental fees and charges applicable to any requests for Governmental Consents shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. Buyer shall be solely responsible for all governmental taxes, fees and charges applicable to the transfer of the Station Assets under this Agreement.

 11.2. _Further Assurances_. After Closing, each party shall from time to time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other, execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Emmis Operating Company is the general partner of Emmis Broadcasting and as such is liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 11.3. _Assignment_. Except as provided by Section 5.9 (1031 Exchange), neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. The terms of this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties respective successors and any permitted assigns, and no assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation or liability under this Agreement.

No party makes any representation or warranty with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller makes no representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to any projections, budgets or other estimates of the Stations revenues, expenses or results of operations, or, except as expressly set forth in Article 2, any other financial or other information made available to Buyer with respect to the Station. 

  

 11.7. _Severability_. If any court or governmental authority holds any provision in this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, so long as no party is deprived of the benefits of this Agreement in any material respect, this Agreement shall be construed with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision deleted and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. 

  

 11.8. _No Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to give any rights to any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 11.9. _Governing Law_. The construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof. 

  

 11.10. _Neutral Construction_. Buyer and Seller agree that this Agreement was negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are the product of the parties negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by Buyer and Seller, and the provisions hereof should not be construed against a party on the grounds that the party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision. 

  

 11.11. _Cooperation_. After Closing, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any action which is pending or threatened against Seller or its affiliates with respect to the Station, whether or not any party has notified the other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such matter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall make available its employees to give depositions or testimony and shall furnish all documentary or other evidence that Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Section 11.11. 

  

 11.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
