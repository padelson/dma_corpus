interest in and to certain assets and liabilities referred to collectively as
the " _Property_ " and set forth in greater detail herein; and



WHEREAS, KMG and WandT propose that, upon and subject to the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, Merger Sub merge with and into KMG Sub under

in the Merger, (b) the membership interests of Merger Sub, all of which are
held by WandT, will be converted into membership interests of KMG Sub and (c)

aggregate consideration hereinafter provided for and KMG, as the holder of all
of such currently issued and outstanding Membership Interests will be
entitled to receive such aggregate consideration;



NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and of the covenants and
agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

1.2 Effective Time. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, on or prior to the Closing Date, in order to effect the
Merger, the Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in
substantially the form of _Exhibit B_ (completed as appropriate to reflect the
terms of this Agreement) shall be executed by KMG Sub as Surviving Entity. If
all the conditions to Closing in _Section 6.2_ shall have been fulfilled or
waived in accordance with this Agreement and this Agreement shall not have
terminated as provided in  _Section 11.20_, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and no later than two business days

forth in this Agreement, Section 18-209 of the Delaware Limited Liability Act
and other applicable provisions of Delaware law.

officers of KMG Sub shall be deemed to have resigned and the managers and
officers of Surviving Entity shall be those persons serving as such on behalf
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of KMG, WandT, KMG Sub, Surviving Entity or Merger Sub,
the membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become fully paid and

5 ARTICLE 2

CONSIDERATION



2.1 Merger Consideration; Certain Other Payments.



2.1.1 Conversion of Membership Interests. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of KMG, WandT, KMG Sub, Surviving
Entity or Merger Sub, the aggregate Membership Interests, all of which are
held by KMG, will be converted to the right to receive, in the aggregate,
$1,339,400,000 (the " _Base Merger Consideration_ "), adjusted as specified in
_Sections 2.1.2_ , _2.2_ and _2.3_. As of the Effective Time, all such
Membership Interests will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and KMG will cease to have any
rights with respect to the Membership Interests, except the right to
receive the Base Merger Consideration, as it may be adjusted pursuant to the
terms hereof.



2.1.2 Performance Deposit. Upon execution of this Agreement, WandT shall pay to
KMG $25,000,000 as a performance deposit (" _Performance Deposit_ "), to
assure WandTs performance under this Agreement. The Performance Deposit is
solely to assure the performance of WandT pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. If WandT refuses or is unable for any reason (including
failure to obtain financing) to close the transaction in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, KMG may, at its sole option, retain the Performance
Deposit as agreed liquidated damages and not as a penalty. However, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 11.20_ (
_Default and Remedies_ ) other than _Section 11.20.1_ ( _KMG s Remedies_),
the Performance Deposit shall be returned without interest as provided in this
Agreement within one (1) business day of termination. If Closing occurs, KMG
shall retain and credit the Performance Deposit against the Base Merger
Consideration at Closing, in which case WandT must pay KMG an amount equal to
the Base Merger Consideration, adjusted as provided in  _Section 2.2_, less
the Performance Deposit.



2.1.3 Bond Premium Payment Reimbursement. From the date hereof until the
Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement, premium payments made by KMG
to obtain bonds for KMG Sub under applicable regulations of the federal
Minerals Management Service (" _ _MMS__ ") shall be reimbursed by WandT
immediately as incurred by KMG. Such reimbursement under this _Section 2.1.3_
is non-refundable, unless this Agreement is terminated by WandT pursuant to 
_Section 11.20.2_ (in which case KMG shall refund such reimbursement amount,
without interest), and shall not be taken as an adjustment to the Base Merger
Consideration under _Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_.



2.2 Adjustments at Closing.



2.2.1 Preliminary Settlement Statement. At Closing, the Base
Merger Consideration will be adjusted as set forth in _Sections 2.1.2_ ,
_2.2.2_ and _2.2.3_. No later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date,
KMG will provide WandT a preliminary settlement statement identifying all
adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration to be made at Closing (the "
_Preliminary Settlement Statement_ "). KMG and WandT acknowledge that some items
in the Preliminary Settlement Statement may be estimates (e.g., revenues)
or otherwise subject to change in the Final Settlement Statement (as
hereinafter defined) for the Property, to be prepared pursuant to _Section
2.3_.



 

6 2.2.2 Upward Adjustments. The Base Merger Consideration will be increased by
the following expenses, revenues and other items:



(i) KMGs share of all actual production and operating costs and expenses,
overhead charges under applicable operating agreements (or, with respect to
active producing or injection Wells included in the Property operated by KMG
that are not subject to an operating agreement, an overhead charge of $500
per each such Well per month), capital expenditures paid or incurred by KMG in
connection with ownership or operation of the Property (including without
limitation royalties, minimum royalties, rentals, and prepaid charges), to
the extent they are attributable to the Property for the period on and after
the Calculation Date until Closing but excluding Hurricane-Related Costs (as
defined in Section 8.12);



(ii) KMGs share of any proceeds from the sale of oil, gas, casinghead gas,
condensate, distillate and other liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons of every kind
or description (" _Hydrocarbons_ ") produced from or attributable to the
Property and other income from the Property received by Surviving Entity or
WandT, to the extent they are attributable to the ownership or operation of the
Property before the Calculation Date;



(iii) $60.00 per barrel for all merchantable Hydrocarbons produced from or
attributable to the Property before the Calculation Date that are stored
in the Lease or unit stock tanks as identified on the OGAR for the production
month of September, 2005 filed with the MMS (the " _Stock Tank Oil_ ") (but
excluding all Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the
Property before the Calculation Date and stored in gathering lines or
production facilities upstream of the sale or custody transfer meters (or
other applicable point at which the transfer of title actually occurs) of the
purchaser or processor of Hydrocarbon production attributable to the Property
which shall, at Closing, be the property of Surviving Entity);



(iv) Imbalance adjustments pursuant to _Section 11.1_, as applicable; and



(v) Any other increases in the Base Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing between KMG and WandT prior to or at
Closing.



2.2.3 Downward Adjustments. The Base Merger Consideration will be decreased
by the following expenses and revenues:



(i) KMGs share of all actual production and operating costs and expenses,
overhead charges under applicable operating agreements, capital expenditures
paid or incurred by WandT in connection with ownership or operation of the
Property (including without limitation royalties, minimum royalties, rentals,
and prepaid charges), to the extent they are attributable to the Property for
the period before the Calculation Date;



 

7 (ii) KMGs share of any proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from
or attributable to the Property and other income attributable to the Property
and received by KMG, to the extent they are attributable to the ownership and
operation of the Property for the period from and after the Calculation Date
until Closing; provided, however, if the Closing Date is on or after the 25th
calendar day of the month, the proceeds of sale of Hydrocarbons marketed
by KMG for the prior calendar month shall be deemed to have been received for
purposes of adjusting the Base Merger Consideration;



(iii) Imbalance adjustments pursuant to _Section 11.1_, as applicable; and



(iv) Any other decreases in the Base Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing between KMG and WandT.



2.3 Adjustments after Closing. 



2.3.1 Final Settlement Statement. Within 120 days after Closing (the " _Final
Settlement Date_ "), KMG will prepare a final settlement statement containing
a final reconciliation of the adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration
specified in _Section 2.2_ (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ "). However,
failure of KMG to complete the Final Settlement Statement within 120 days
after Closing will not constitute a waiver of any right to an adjustment
otherwise due. WandT will have 30 days after receiving the Final Settlement
Statement to provide KMG with written exceptions to any items in the Final
Settlement Statement that WandT believes in good faith to be questionable. All
items in the Final Settlement Statement to which WandT does not take written
exception within the 30-day review period will be deemed correct.



2.3.2 Payment of Post-Closing Adjustments. Any adjustments to the Base Merger
Consideration (excluding disputed items) will be offset against each other so
that only one payment is required. The party owing payment will pay the other
party the net post-Closing adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration within
10 days after the expiration of WandTs 30-day review period for the
Final Settlement Statement. However, the payment of any disputed items will
be subject to the further rights of the parties under _Section 2.3.3_.



2.3.3 Resolution of Disputed Items. After the completion and delivery of the
Final Settlement Statement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
attempt to reach agreement on the amount due with respect to any disputed
items in the Final Settlement Statement. If the parties agree on the amount
due with respect to any disputed items, and a payment adjustment is required,
the party owing payment will pay the other party within 10 days after the
parties reach agreement. If the parties are unable to agree on the amount due
with respect to any disputed items within 60 days after KMG receives WandTs
written exceptions to the Final Settlement Statement, then the disputed items
will be submitted to a mutually agreed upon independent expert (" _Accounting
Referee_ "). The costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be shared
equally by WandT and KMG. Within 10 days after a decision of the Accounting
Referee, WandT and KMG, as the case may be, shall promptly make a cash payment
to the other equal to the sum as may be found by the Accounting Referee.



 

8 2.3.4 Further Revenues and Expenses.



2.3.4.1 KMG agrees as follows with respect to production marketed by it: 



(i) If the Closing Date occurs before the 25th calendar day of the month, the
proceeds of sale of Hydrocarbons for the prior month shall be deemed to be
received on the 25th calendar day of the month and KMG shall wire transfer to
WandT the proceeds by the 5th business day following such 25th calendar day;



(ii) The proceeds of the sale of Hydrocarbons for the calendar month during
which the Closing occurs shall be deemed to be received on the 25th calendar
day of the following month and KMG shall wire transfer the proceeds to WandT by
the 5th business day following such 25th calendar day; and



(iii) The proceeds of the sale of Hydrocarbons for any other month
following the Closing shall be deemed to be received on the 25th day of the
month following the month of production and shall be wire transferred to WandT
by the 5th business day following such 25th calendar day;



2.3.4.2 After the completion of the post-Closing adjustments under this 
_Section 2.3_, (i) if either party receives revenues that belong to the other
party under this Agreement, the party receiving the revenues agrees to
promptly remit those revenues to the other party, and (ii) if either party
pays expenses that are the responsibility of the other party under this
Agreement, the party on whose behalf the expenses were paid agrees to promptly
reimburse the other party for the expenses paid on its behalf upon receiving
satisfactory evidence of such payment. However, neither party will be
obligated to reimburse the other party for any single expense in excess of
$5,000 unless it has been consulted about that expense prior to payment.



2.4 Payment Method. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing,
all payments under this Agreement will be by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the party receiving payment.



2.5 Principles of Accounting. The Preliminary Settlement Statement and Final
Settlement Statement will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States, and applicable laws, rules and
regulations, and with reasonable supporting documentation for each item in
those statements.

inspection and shall INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD KMG HARMLESS from and against
any and all Claims arising from WandT inspecting and observing the Property and
KMGs and KMG Subs records pursuant to this _Article 5_ , including, without
limitation, (i) Claims for personal injuries to or death of employees of the
WandT, its contractors, agents, consultants, representatives and invitees, and
damage to the property of WandT or others acting on behalf of WandT, regardless of
whether such Claims arise out of or result in whole or in part, from the
condition of the Property or KMGs and KMG Subs (or their employees,
agents, contractors, successors or assigns) sole or concurrent negligence,
strict liability or fault, and (ii) Claims for personal injuries to or death
of employees of KMG and KMG Sub or third parties, and damage to the property
of KMG and KMG Sub or third parties, to the extent caused by the negligence,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of WandT.



5.3 Environmental Assessment.



5.3.1 Inspection. Prior to Closing, WandT will have the right to conduct a
Phase I environmental assessment of the Property, subject to the terms set
forth in _Section 5.2_. However, the Phase I environmental assessment must be
conducted by an agent or representative



 

18 of WandT (the " _Inspector_ ") acceptable to both KMG and WandT. For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Phase I environmental assessment_ " means (i) a review
of KMGs or KMG Subs and the governments environmental records related to
the Property, (ii) the submission of pre-inspection questionnaires to KMG,
(iii) a site visit to visually inspect the Property, and (iv) interviews with
corporate and site personnel of KMG. A Phase I environmental assessment does
not include soil or groundwater sampling or effluent sampling or testing
or subsurface testing of any kind, unless otherwise agreed in writing by KMG
and WandT.



5.3.2 Inspection Results. Each party will be entitled to receive a copy of the
Inspectors final Phase I inspection results for the Property, including
without limitation all final written reports, data and conclusions of the
Inspector. WandT agrees to hold confidential and not disclose the Phase I
inspection results for the Property, and any KMG or KMG Sub information
reviewed during the Phase I Inspection, in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement between WandT and KMG dated July 12, 2005 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). If Closing does not occur, WandT shall promptly
return to KMG all written reports, data and conclusions of the Inspector.



5.3.3 Notice of Adverse Environmental Conditions.



5.3.3.1 Prior to Closing, WandT will review the inspection results for the
Property and determine, based on those results and such other information as
may be available to WandT if any Adverse Environmental Conditions exist with
respect to the Property. No later than twenty (20) business days before
Closing (the " _Environmental Notice Deadline_ "), WandT will notify KMG in
writing of any Adverse Environmental Condition with respect to the Property.
Such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the Adverse Environmental
Condition, include all data and information in WandTs and the Inspectors
possession or control bearing thereon, and include the estimated Environmental
Defect Value attributable thereto. The " _Environmental Defect Value_ "
attributable to any Adverse Environmental Condition will be the estimated
amount of all reasonable costs and Claims net to KMG Subs interest in the
allegedly affected portion of the Property associated with the existence,
remediation or correction of the Adverse Environmental Condition, as
reasonably determined and estimated by the Inspector on a current cost basis.
" _Adverse Environmental Condition_ " means and includes, with respect to any
portion of the Property (i) the failure of the Property to be in compliance
with applicable Environmental Laws, or any contract or agreement relating to
the environmental condition of the Property (except to the extent such
noncompliance with an agreement or contract was previously waived by the other
party or is barred by the statute of limitations or the current owner of the
Property does not have standing to assert a claim for noncompliance), (ii)
the Property being subject to any agreements, consent orders, decrees, or
judgments, in existence at this time based on any Environmental Laws that
negatively impact the future use of any material portion of the Property, or
that require any change in the present conditions of any of the Property, and
(iii) the Property being subject to any uncured notices of violations of or
noncompliance with any applicable Environmental Laws; provided, however, that
no individual matter shall be deemed to be or constitute an Adverse
Environmental Condition unless the Environmental Defect Value for such matter
exceeds $25,000, net to KMG Subs interest in the allegedly affected portion
of the Property. The term " _Environmental Laws_ " means any statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, code, order, judicial writ, injunction, or decree
issued by any federal, state, or local governmental authority as in effect on
or before the Calculation Date relating to the control of any pollutant or



 

19 protection of the air, water, land or environment or the release or disposal
of hazardous materials, hazardous substances or waste materials. KMG will
notify WandT of any Adverse Environmental Conditions of which it becomes aware
between execution of this Agreement and the Closing. However, such notice
shall not entitle WandT to give KMG any additional notices of Adverse
Environmental Conditions based thereon after the Environmental Notice
Deadline.



5.3.3.2 If the parties are unable to agree upon the Environmental Defect Value
for a particular Adverse Environmental Condition within fifteen (15) days
prior to Closing, after having attempted in good faith to resolve the
disagreement by negotiation between management level persons having authority
to resolve the disagreement, then the disputed matters shall be submitted to a
mutually agreed independent expert (" _Environmental Referee_ "). The costs
and expenses of the Environmental Referee shall be shared equally by WandT and
KMG. Subject to _Section 6.3_, the decision of the Environmental Referee
regarding the amount of the Environmental Defect Value shall be binding on
both parties.



5.3.4 Rights and Remedies for Environmental Conditions.



5.3.4.1 With respect to any Adverse Environmental Condition affecting the
Property, WandT may request KMG to cure the Adverse Environmental Condition, but
KMG will have no obligation to cure the Adverse Environmental Condition.



5.3.4.2 The rights and remedies of the Parties with respect to
uncured Adverse Environmental Conditions on the Property (other than Adverse
Environmental Conditions that KMG has agreed to cure) are as follows:



(i) If the collective Environmental Defect Values attributable to all uncured
Adverse Environmental Conditions is less than or equal to 1.5% of the
Base Merger Consideration (the " _ED_ _Deductible Amount_ "), the Parties
will be obligated to proceed with Closing without curative action by KMG with
respect to such Adverse Environmental Conditions and without an adjustment to
the Base Merger Consideration, except as provided in clause (ii) below.



(ii) If an uncured Adverse Environmental Condition for an individual matter
has an Environmental Defect Value in excess of $5 million, net to KMG Subs
interest in the allegedly affected portion of the Property, the Base Merger
Consideration will be reduced by the amount of the Environmental Defect Value
in excess of $5 million, and the parties will be obligated to proceed with
Closing without curative action by KMG.



(iii) If the collective Environmental Defect Values attributable to
all uncured Adverse Environmental Conditions exceeds the ED Deductible
Amount, the Base Merger Consideration will be reduced by the amount of the
collective Environmental Defect Values in excess of the ED Deductible Amount,
to the extent such reduction has not been taken into account under clause
(ii), and the parties will be obligated to proceed with Closing without
curative action by KMG.



5.3.4.3 The term " _cure_ " or " _curative_ " means, with respect to any
Adverse Environmental Condition, the undertaking and completion of those
actions and activities necessary to remediate such Adverse Environmental
Condition to the degree necessary



 

20 such that such Adverse Environmental Condition no longer constitutes an
Adverse Environmental Condition as defined above. KMG shall promptly notify
WandT at such time as it believes an Adverse Environmental Condition has been
cured. WandT shall promptly notify KMG of whether it agrees such condition is
cured. If WandT fails to notify KMG of its determination with respect to such
cure within seven (7) days following receipt of KMGs notice, such Adverse
Environmental Condition shall be deemed cured. If KMG and WandT are unable to
agree that an Adverse Environmental Condition has been cured, after having
attempted in good faith to resolve the disagreement by negotiation between
management level persons having authority to resolve the disagreement, then
the disputed matter shall be submitted to the Environmental Referee, whose
decision will be binding on both parties.



5.3.4.4 If KMG refuses or is unable to cure an Adverse Environmental
Condition before Closing, KMG may notify WandT that KMG elects to retain the
affected portion of the Property and cause KMG Sub to re-convey such portion
of the Property to KMG prior to Closing. In such case, the Environmental
Defect Value for such portion of the Property for purposes of _Section
5.3.4.2 _(notwithstanding clause (ii) or (iii) thereof) shall be determined to
be an amount which is mutually agreed upon by KMG and WandT (the " _Agreed
Value_ "). If KMG fails to give notice of KMGs election to retain such
portion of the Property within the time allowed therefor, KMG and WandT will
have the rights and remedies set forth in  _Section 5.3.4.2_ with respect to
the uncured Adverse Environmental Condition, unless the parties otherwise
agree in writing.



5.3.5 Exclusive Remedies. Except as provided in _Section 8.4.4_, the remedies
set forth in this _Section 5.3_ are the sole and exclusive remedies of WandT
with respect to any Adverse Environmental Condition (and all Environmental
Obligations arising out of any such Adverse Environmental Condition)
attributable to KMGs or KMG Subs ownership, operation or the condition of
the Property prior to the Calculation Date, regardless of whether WandT notifies
KMG of any such Adverse Environmental Condition. KMG shall have no liability
to WandT for any such Adverse Environmental Condition (or its
related Environmental Obligations) if WandT fails to notify KMG as provided in
_Section 5.3.3_.



5.4 Bonding.



5.4.1 Bonding Requirements. WandT agrees to, or cause Surviving Entity to,
promptly purchase and post, and to maintain in accordance with applicable
laws, any and all bonds, supplemental bonds or other securities on behalf of
Surviving Entity which may be required of it pursuant to all applicable
federal and state laws, rules and regulations.



5.5 Preferential Rights and Consents to Assign.



5.5.1 Notices to Holders.



5.5.1.1 With respect to any portion of the Property as to which
the conveyance to KMG Sub pursuant to the Contribution Agreement (as defined
in _Section 8.4.1_), or the Merger transaction contemplated herein, may
trigger third party preferential purchase rights, rights of first refusal, or
similar rights (collectively, " _Preferential Rights_ "), or may require
third party consents to assign or trigger similar rights (collectively, "
_Consents_ "), KMG



 

21 shall use reasonable efforts to (i) notify the holders of the Preferential
Rights and Consents of the proposed transaction, (ii) provide them with any
information about the transaction to which they are entitled (including the
portion of the Base Merger Consideration allocated by the parties to the
affected portion of the Property, as set forth in  _Exhibit A_ , _Schedule 4_
, provided that the parties have allocated a portion of the Base Merger
Consideration to such portion of the Property, and otherwise such portion of
the Base Merger Consideration as mutually agreed upon by KMG and WandT), and
(iii) in the case of Consents, ask the holders of the Consents to consent to
the transaction.



5.5.1.2 KMG shall promptly notify WandT whether (i) any Preferential Rights are
exercised or waived, (ii) any Consents are denied, or (iii) the requisite
time periods have elapsed and any Preferential Rights are deemed waived or
Consents deemed given by the lapse of such requisite time periods under the
applicable agreements.



5.5.2 Remedies After Closing.



5.5.2.1 Preferential Rights. After Closing, if KMG or WandT discovers, or any
third party has alleged or alleges, the existence of Preferential Rights, KMG
and WandT will attempt to obtain waivers of those Preferential Rights. If KMG
and WandT are unable to obtain waivers of such Preferential Rights, and such
Preferential Rights are not deemed waived, or the third party ultimately
establishes and exercises its rights, then WandT shall convey such Property or
portion of such Property to the third party holder of the Preferential Rights
and WandT shall be entitled to receive (and KMG hereby assigns to WandT all of
KMGs rights to) all proceeds to be received from such third party, in
connection with the sale, due to an exercise of Preferential Rights, of any
portion of the Property. WandTs receipt of proceeds from the sale of the
affected Property shall be WandTs sole remedy if Preferential Rights are
established and exercised after Closing.



5.5.2.2 Consents. After Closing, KMG and WandT shall cooperate and attempt to
obtain any unobtained Consents, including Consents alleged by third parties
or identified after Closing.



5.6 Title Defects.



5.6.1 Certain Definitions.



5.6.1.1 Title Defects. For the purposes of this Agreement, a " _Title Defect_
" means any impairment, encumbrance, lien, encroachment, irregularity, defect
in, default, objection or dispute concerning KMGs and KMG Subs title to the
Property, and that in the reasonable opinion of WandT would:



(i) Reduce, impair or prevent KMG Sub from receiving payment for sales of
Hydrocarbons from the purchasers of production and/or the operator from all or
a portion of the Property;



(ii) Reduce KMG Subs net revenue interest in all or a portion of
the Property below that attributable thereto and set forth in the applicable
Schedule to _Exhibit A_ ;



 

22 (iii) Increase KMG Subs working interest in all or a portion of the Property
above that attributable thereto and set forth in the applicable Schedule to
_Exhibit A_ without a proportional increase in KMG Subs net revenue interest
therein; or



(iv) Restrict, interfere with or extinguish KMG Subs right to operate, market
Hydrocarbons from (excluding Material Related Contracts) or use the Property
as owner, lessee, licensee or permittee, as applicable.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual matter described above shall be
deemed to be or constitute a Title Defect unless the Title Defect Value for
such matter exceeds $25,000, net to KMG Subs interest in the affected
portion of the Property, and no Adverse Environmental Condition, Imbalances,
Permitted Encumbrances, Consents or Preferential Rights will be considered a
Title Defect under this _Section 5.6_.



The parties acknowledge that lack of MMS approval of the assignment of all
of the Leases into KMG Sub shall not be considered a Title Defect, but shall
be treated as a condition to Closing pursuant to clause (c) of _Section
6.2.2_.



5.6.1.2 Permitted Encumbrances. The term " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " means:



(i) Any materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees, contractors,
operators, or other similar liens, security interests or charges for
liquidated amounts arising in the ordinary course of business incidental to
construction, maintenance, development, production or operation of the
Property, or the production or processing of Hydrocarbons therefrom, that are
not delinquent or, if delinquent, are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings;



(ii) Any liens for taxes not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings;



(iii) Any liens or security interests created by law or reserved in oil, gas
and/or mineral leases for royalty, bonus or rental or for compliance with the
terms of any Property;



(iv) Any third party easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, licenses,
surface leases and other rights with respect to surface operations, to the
extent such matters do not interfere in any material respect with KMG Subs
operation of the portion of the Property burdened thereby;



(v) The Preferential Rights and Consents referred to in _Section 5.5.1_, and
other preferential purchase rights, consent to assignment provisions and
similar restrictions that may apply with respect to any sale, transfer or
other disposition of any Property by Surviving Entity after the Closing;



(vi) liens created under any Leases and/or operating agreements or by
operation of law in respect of obligations that are not yet due or that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings by or on behalf of
KMG;



 

23 (vii) any encumbrance affecting the Property which is expressly assumed,
bonded or paid by WandT at or prior to Closing or which is discharged by KMG at
or prior to Closing;



(viii) the terms and conditions of the Leases and the Material Related
Contracts;



(ix) such Title Defects as WandT may have waived;



(x) rights of a common owner of any interest in rights of way or easements
currently held by KMG and such common owner as tenants in common or through
common ownership;



(xi) All royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests,
carried interests, reversionary interests and other burdens, to the extent
that the net cumulative effect of such burdens, as to a particular Property,
does not operate to reduce the net revenue interest of KMG Sub in such
Property below that specified in the applicable Schedule to _Exhibit A_;



(xii) Conventional rights of reassignment arising upon surrender or
abandonment of any Property pursuant to joint operating agreements;



(xiii) Rights reserved to or vested in any governmental authority to control
or regulate any of the Wells or Units included in the Property and
all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of such authorities so
long as the same have not been applied to decrease KMG Subs net revenue
interest below the net revenue interest specified in the applicable Schedule
to _Exhibit A_ ; and 



(xiv) all other instruments, obligations, defects, and irregularities
affecting the Property that individually or in the aggregate are not such as
to materially interfere with the operation or use of any of the Property (as
currently owned and operated), do not reduce the net revenue interest of KMG
in any Property to an amount less than the net revenue interest set forth on
the applicable Schedule to _Exhibit A_ for such Property and do not obligate
KMG to bear a working interest for such Property in any amount greater than
the working interest set forth on the applicable Schedule to _Exhibit A_ for
such Property (unless the net revenue interest for such Property is greater
than the net revenue interest set forth on the applicable Schedule to _Exhibit
A_ in the same proportion as any increase in such working interest).



5.6.2 Notice of Title Defects. WandT will review title to the Property prior to
Closing and notify KMG in writing of any Title Defect it discovers as soon as
reasonably practicable after its discovery, but in no event more than
three (3) business days after conclusion of the Due Diligence Period. Such
notice shall describe in reasonable detail the Title Defect, including WandTs
calculation of the Adjustment Value of the Leases(s) or Unit(s) affected by
the Title Defect, WandTs calculation of the reduction in the Base Merger
Consideration for the Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Value_ "), and include
all data and information in WandTs possession or control bearing thereon. The
Title Defect Value resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount by which
the Adjustment Value of the affected part(s) of the Property (the " _Title
Defect_



 

24 _Property_ ") is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect.
The Title Defect Value shall be determined in accordance with the following
terms and conditions: (i) if WandT and KMG agree on the Title Defect Value, then
that amount shall be the Title Defect Value; (ii) if the Title Defect is an
Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title
Defect Value shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from the Title Defect Property; (iii) if the Title Defect represents a
discrepancy between (A) the net revenue interest for any Title Defect
Property and (B) the net revenue interest stated in the applicable Schedule to
_Exhibit A_ , then the Title Defect Value shall be the product of the
Adjustment Value of such Property, or part thereof, multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the net revenue interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the net revenue interest stated in the applicable
Schedule to _Exhibit A_ ; (iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation
or Encumbrance upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a
type not described above, the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking
into account the Adjustment Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion
of the Title Defect Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect
of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over
the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect
by WandT and KMG and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation; (v) the Title Defect Value with respect to a Title Defect
Property shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses
included in another Title Defect Value calculation hereunder; and (vi)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6_, the aggregate
Title Defect Values attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the value of the Title Defect
Property.



5.6.3 Waiver of Title Defects. WandT will be deemed to have conclusively waived
any Title Defect about which it fails to notify KMG in writing within three
(3) business days after the conclusion of the Due Diligence Period.



5.6.3.1 Disputes Regarding Title Defect Value. If the parties are unable to
agree upon the Title Defect Value for a particular Title Defect within fifteen
(15) days prior to Closing, after having attempted in good faith to resolve
the disagreement by negotiation between management level persons
having authority to resolve the disagreement, then the disputed matters shall
be submitted to a mutually agreed upon independent expert (" _Title Referee_
"). The costs and expenses of the Title Referee shall be shared equally
by WandT and KMG and the decision of the Title Referee regarding the amount of
the Title Defect Value shall be binding on both parties.



5.6.4 Request to Cure Title Defects. If WandT notifies KMG of a Title Defect as
provided in _Section 5.6.2_, WandT may request KMG to cure the Title Defect,
but KMG will have no obligation to cure any Title Defect. If KMG agrees to
attempt to cure a Title Defect, KMG must cure the Title Defect before Closing,
unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.



5.6.5 Remedies for Uncured Title Defects. If WandT notifies KMG of any Title
Defect as provided in _Section 5.6.2_, and KMG refuses or is unable to cure
the Title Defect before Closing, then WandT and KMG will have the following
rights and remedies with respect to the uncured Title Defect(s) in
the Property, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.



 

25 (i) WandT may waive the uncured Title Defect and proceed with Closing without
adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration.



(ii) KMG may elect to retain the affected portion of the Property and cause
KMG Sub to reconvey such portion of the Property to KMG prior to the Closing.
In such case, the Title Defect Value for such portion of the Property for
purposes of clause (iii) below shall be the Agreed Value.



(iii) If the collective Title Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Title
Defects are less than or equal to 1.5% of the Base Merger Consideration (the "
_TD Deductible Amount_ "), KMG and WandT will be obligated to proceed with
Closing without curative action by KMG with respect to such Title Defects and
without adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration.



(iv) If the collective Title Defect Values of uncured, unwaived Title Defects
exceeds the TD Deductible Amount, the Base Merger Consideration will be
reduced by the amount of the collective Title Defect Values in excess of the
TD Deductible Amount, in which case the parties will be obligated to proceed
with Closing without curative action by KMG.



5.6.6 Exclusive Remedy. The remedies set forth in this _Section 5.6_ are
WandTs exclusive remedies under this Agreement for all Title Defects, and KMG
shall have no other liability to WandT with respect to Title Defects.



5.6.7 Interest Additions. If it is determined prior to Closing that KMG Sub
owns a net revenue interest in any of the Property that is greater than the
net revenue interest set forth in _Exhibit A_ ,  _Schedule 1_ (a " _NRI
Increase_ "), the parties shall use their best efforts to reach mutual
agreement regarding an upward adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration on
account of the NRI Increase using the principles applicable to the
calculation of Title Defect Values set forth in _Section 5.6.2_ (such value
being referred to as " _NRI Value_ "). If the parties are unable to agree on
the amount of the upward adjustment, Closing shall nevertheless occur and the
dispute shall be resolved by the Title Referee, after the parties have made a
good faith attempt to resolve the dispute by negotiation between management
level persons having authority to settle the dispute. The Title Referees
decision on such matter shall be binding upon both parties. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no individual matter described above shall be deemed to be or
constitute an NRI Increase unless the NRI Value for such matter
exceeds $25,000, net to KMG Subs interest in the affected portion of the
Property. If the collective NRI Values are less than or equal to 1.5% of the
Base Merger Consideration, KMG and WandT will be obligated to proceed with
Closing without adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration.



5.7 Casualty Losses and Government Takings.



5.7.1 Notice of Casualty Losses. If, prior to the Closing Date, all or part
of the Property is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, storm, or other
casualty (" _Casualty Loss_ "), or is taken in condemnation or under the right
of eminent domain, or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or
threatened (" _Government Taking_ "), KMG must promptly notify



 

26 WandT in writing of the nature and extent of the Casualty Loss or Government
Taking and KMGs estimate of the cost required to repair or replace that
portion of the Property affected by the Casualty Loss or value of the Property
taken by the Government Taking.



5.7.2 Remedies for Casualty Losses and Government Takings. With respect to
each Casualty Loss to or Government Taking of the Property, KMG and WandT will
have the following rights and remedies:



(i) If the aggregate agreed cost to repair or replace the portion of the
Property affected by the Casualty Loss is less than the Applicable Deductible,
the Base Merger Consideration will not be adjusted, and the parties will
proceed with Closing. As used herein, the " _Applicable Deductible_ " is (a)
if KMG Subs working interest in the affected portion of the Property is
between 50% and 100%, $5 million, (b) if KMG Subs working interest in the
affected portion of the Property is between 40% and 49.99%, $4 million, (c)
if KMG Subs working interest in the affected portion of the Property is
between 30% and 39.99%, $3 million, (d) if KMG Subs working interest in the
affected portion of the Property is between 20% and 29.99%, $2 million and
(e) if KMG Subs working interest in the affected portion of the Property is
greater than 0% but less than 20%, $1 million. If the Adjustment Value of the
portion of the Property taken in any Government Taking is less than 2% of the
Base Merger Consideration, the Base Merger Consideration will not be adjusted
by the aggregate Adjustment Value of the Property taken by the Government
Taking, and the parties will proceed with Closing.



(ii) If the aggregate agreed cost to repair or replace the portion of the
Property affected by the Casualty Loss is greater than the Applicable
Deductible, the Base Merger Consideration will be reduced by the aggregate
amount of the agreed cost of the Casualty Loss in excess of the Applicable
Deductible, and the parties will proceed with Closing. If the Adjustment Value
of the Property taken in any Government Taking is greater than 2% of the Base
Merger Consideration, the Base Merger Consideration will be reduced by
the aggregate amount of the Adjustment Value of the Property taken by the
Government Taking in excess of 2% of the Base Merger Consideration, and the
parties will proceed with Closing.



5.7.3 Insurance Proceeds and Settlement Payments. If KMG and WandT adjust the
Base Merger Consideration of the Property due to a Casualty Loss or
Government Taking, and proceed with Closing, KMG will be entitled to (i) all
insurance proceeds payable to KMG with respect to any such Casualty Loss, (ii)
all sums paid to KMG or WandT by third parties by reason of any such Casualty
Loss, and (iii) all compensation paid to KMG or WandT with respect to any such
Government Taking. If KMG and WandT do not adjust the Base Merger Consideration
of the Property due to a Casualty Loss or Government Taking and proceed with
Closing, KMG will remit to WandT without recourse to KMG (i) all insurance
proceeds payable to KMG with respect to any such Casualty Loss, (ii) all sums
paid to KMG by third parties by reason of any such Casualty Loss, and (iii)
all compensation paid to KMG with respect to any such Government Taking.



5.7.4 Change in Condition. WandT will assume all risk and loss with respect to,
and any change in the condition of the Property from and after the
Calculation Date, including production of Hydrocarbons through normal
depletion, the watering-out, casing collapse or sand infiltration of any well,
and the depreciation of personal property through ordinary wear and tear.



 

27 None of the events or conditions set forth in this _Section 5.7.4_ will be
considered a Casualty Loss with respect to the Property, nor will they be
cause for any other reduction in the Base Merger Consideration, or give rise
to any right to terminate this Agreement.



 

ARTICLE 6

DAMAGES RECOVERED BY A THIRD PARTY (OTHER THAN SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR
PARENTS OF A PARTY) FOR WHICH A PARTY OWES THE OTHER PARTY AN INDEMNITY UNDER
THIS ARTICLE 8 SHALL NOT BE WAIVED.



8.12 Hurricane-Related Costs.



8.12.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Hurricane-Related Costs_ "
means actual, out-of-pocket costs incurred by (i) KMG or KMG Sub prior to
Closing and (ii) Surviving Entity or WandT after Closing, in each case (x) net
to KMG Subs interest in the affected portion of the Property and (y) to
third parties for the repair of physical damage to equipment, platforms,
pipelines and other tangible property included in the Property to the extent
such damage is directly and demonstrably attributable to Hurricanes Katrina
or Rita, and necessary to (1) restore such property to serviceable condition,
as compared to its pre-hurricane condition, or (2) to bring such property into
compliance with applicable MMS rules or regulations or those of any
other governmental body or similar authority having jurisdiction over the
Property, or subject to _Section 8.12.3_, the replacement of any such damaged
property, and for which no adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration was
previously made pursuant to any provision of this Agreement (" _Hurricane-
Related Damages_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, KMG is solely responsible for all Hurricane-Related Costs and
Hurricane-Related Damages, as defined herein.



8.12.2 Prior to June 1, 2006, with respect to KMG-operated Properties,
subject to _Section 10.1_, KMG agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to identify, through completion of the Level II Surveys for the
Property, and repair or, subject to  _Section 8.12.3_, replace any Property
that suffered Hurricane-Related Damages in accordance with its customary
business practices (" _Identified Operated Hurricane-Related Damages_ ").
Prior to Closing, KMG will pay all Hurricane-Related Costs for Identified
Operated Hurricane-Related Damages directly and not invoice KMG Sub. After
Closing, KMG shall continue to make payments for Identified Operated
Hurricane-Related Damages directly, and if applicable, upon written request
shall promptly reimburse Surviving Entity or WandT in the event Surviving Entity
or WandT is invoiced or has to complete the repair work on behalf of KMG for the
Identified Hurricane-Related Damages. Prior to October 1, 2006, with respect
to KMG-nonoperated Properties, KMG agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to contact the operators and identify, through a Level II Survey,
damage reports or from an AFE, the repairs necessary for the Hurricane-
Related Damages (" _Identified Non-Operated Hurricane-Related Damages_ ").
Upon any request for reimbursement from KMG, WandT will provide, upon request,
copies of any relevant AFEs or invoices, if available at such time.

 



8.12.3 As of the date of this Agreement, KMG represents that, to the best of
its knowledge, there is no Property that has Hurricane-Related Damage which
requires full replacement. In the case of a claim for Hurricane-Related Costs
consisting of expenses for the



 

38 replacement of property, KMGs reimbursement obligation shall apply only if
repair was not practicable and if the value of such Property prior to such
damage, in KMGs reasonable commercial judgment, would warrant replacement,
and then only to the portion of the replacement cost necessary to restore the
affected property to a condition similar to that which existed prior to the
damage considering normal wear and tear, and in no event will KMGs
reimbursement obligation extend to the cost of any upgrading or improvement
(as compared to its condition prior to the hurricane) of the property
so replaced Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if KMG
elects not to replace any Property pursuant to this _Section 8.12.3_, the
Base Merger Consideration will be reduced by the Agreed Value of that Property
(including the Leases, Wells or reserves included therein).

ARTICLE 10

CERTAIN COVENANTS PENDING CLOSING



10.1 Operations. From and after the date of execution of this Agreement and
until the Closing, subject to _Section 10.1.1_ and the constraints of
applicable operating agreements, KMG and/or KMG Sub (i) shall operate, manage
and administer the Property in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with
its past practices, and shall carry on its business with respect to
the Property in substantially the same manner as before execution of this
Agreement; (ii) shall not sell, dispose of, or encumber the Property with a
lien or mortgage (other than Permitted Encumbrances), the effect of which
would be to cause KMG Subs interest in the Property to be less than that set
forth on _Exhibit A_ , _Schedule 1_ , except with respect to the sale of
Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) shall promptly
notify WandT of the receipt of any notice of preferential rights to purchase
with respect to the Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, KMG and/or KMG
Sub shall have no obligation to extend the primary term of any of the Leases
from which Hydrocarbons have never been produced or to renew same. From and
after the date of execution of this Agreement and until the Closing, subject
to _Section 10.1.1_ and the constraints of applicable operating agreements,
KMG and/or KMG Sub shall, except for emergency action taken in the face of
serious risk to life, property or the environment (i) submit to WandT, for prior
written approval, all requests for operating or capital expenditures and all
proposed contracts and agreements relating to the Property that involve
individual commitments of more than $50,000 that would be required to be
expended by Surviving Entity after the Calculation Date; and (ii) not approve
or elect to go nonconsent as to any proposed well or, except as required by
applicable law or regulations, plug and abandon or agree to plug and abandon
any well without WandTs prior written approval. On any matter requiring WandTs
approval under this _Section 10.1_, WandT shall respond within seven (7) days
from KMGs and/or KMG Subs request for approval (or such shorter period of
time as may be required by the applicable operating agreement) and failure of
WandT to respond within such time period shall release KMG and/or KMG Sub from
the obligation to obtain WandTs approval before proceeding on such matter as
KMG and/or KMG Sub may elect in its sole discretion. WandTs sole remedy for
KMGs and/or KMG Subs breach of its obligations under this _Section 10.1_
shall be equal to WandTs actual damages, if any, for such breach.



 

40 10.1.1 Non Operated Properties. To the extent that KMG and/or KMG Sub is not
the operator of any of the Property, the obligations of KMG and/or KMG Sub in
_Section 10.1_ concerning operations or activities that normally, or pursuant
to existing contracts are carried out or performed by the operator, shall be
construed to require only that KMG and/or KMG Sub use all reasonable efforts
(without being obligated to incur any expense or institute any cause of
action) to cause the operator of such portion of the Property to take such
actions or render such performance within the constraints of the applicable
operating or other agreements.



10.2 Federal and State Approvals. KMG, prior to Closing, shall file for
approval with the applicable government agencies all conveyances on official
forms and related documentation required to effectuate the transfer of the
Property to KMG Sub in accordance with the requirements of federal or state
regulations (the " _Federal Assignment Documents_ "). KMG further agrees to
take all other actions required of it by federal or state agencies having
jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals, of (i) the
assignment documents requiring federal or state approval in order for KMG Sub
to be recognized by the federal or state agencies as the owner of the
Property, and (ii) KMG Subs qualification as the operator of record with
respect to that portion of the Property for which KMG Sub becomes successor
operator under the operating agreements applicable to any of the Property,
together with any necessary rights of use and easements as to the pipeline(s)
included in the Property. KMG shall provide WandT approved copies of the Federal
Assignment Documents as soon as they are available.



10.3 Limitations Related to KMG Sub. Except as may be expressly permitted by
this Agreement or as set forth in any exhibit hereto, from the date hereof
until the Closing Date, without first obtaining the written consent of WandT
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), KMG
will not permit KMG Sub to (i) make any material change in the conduct of its
business or operations, including, without limitation, its trading activities
and the payment (including the timing of payments) of accounts payable of the
company, (ii) issue any membership interests, or repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such interests or make or propose to make any other
change to its capitalization, (iii) merge into or with or consolidate with any
other entity or acquire all or substantially all of the business or assets of
any person, (iv) make any change in its Limited Liability Company Agreement or
the Contribution Agreement and any Assignment and Bill of Sale executed
pursuant thereto, (v) purchase any securities of any person except for short-
term investments made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, or (vi) commit itself to do any of the foregoing.



10.4 KMG Sub. Promptly after the date hereof, KMG agrees to file a certificate
of amendment to KMG Subs certificate of formation for the purpose of
changing its name.



10.5 [Intentionally Omitted.] HSR Act. Within ten (10) business days
following the execution by the parties hereto of this Agreement (or such later
time as they may mutually agree), KMG and WandT will each (i) prepare and
simultaneously file with the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") and the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") the notification and report form
required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Hart Scott
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ "), (ii) request early termination of
the waiting period thereunder and (iii) comply in all material respects with
the filing and disclosure requirements of the HSR Act. KMG and WandT



 

41 agree to respond within a reasonable time to any requests for additional
information and inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC concerning such filings.
KMG and WandT shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the terms of
_Section 5.1_ (which confidentiality provisions shall, for purposes of this
Section, be deemed to apply to KMG), shall promptly furnish all information
to the other party that is necessary for that party to comply with the HSR
Act. KMG and WandT shall keep each other fully advised with respect to any
requests from or communications with the DOJ or FTC concerning such filings.
Each of KMG and WandT shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions reasonably necessary and appropriate in connection with any HSR Act
filing to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



ARTICLE 11

MISCELLANEOUS



11.1 Imbalances. KMG and WandT agree that the Base Merger Consideration paid at
Closing shall be adjusted pursuant to _Section 11.1.1_ for the Imbalances set
forth in _Exhibit E_ on the basis of a price per Mcf or barrel, as
applicable, to be agreed upon by the parties prior to Closing (the "
_Imbalance Price_ "). If KMG and WandT determine no later than 120 days after
Closing that the Imbalances stated in  _Exhibit E_ are inaccurate, the
parties agree to exchange additional compensation, pursuant to _Section 2.3_,
on the basis of the Imbalance Price, for the difference between the Imbalances
and the revised Imbalances determined by the parties. Such settlement shall
be final and neither party thereafter shall make claim upon the other
concerning production imbalances with respect to the Property. Except with
respect to its right to receive the post-Closing Base Merger Consideration
adjustment set forth above, WandT will be solely responsible for and shall
assume all rights against (including rights to receive make-up gas or to
receive cash balancing payments) and obligations to (including obligations to
make-up gas or to make cash balancing payments) third parties with respect to
any Imbalances.



11.2 [Intentionally omitted.]



11.3 [Intentionally omitted.]



11.4 Survival. All of the covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the parties in this Agreement will survive the Closing for
a period of six (6) months and shall not be actionable thereafter. Neither
party to this Agreement will be entitled to make a Claim against the other
party in connection with the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
of the other party in this Agreement unless the other party is notified of
that Claim in writing within six (6) months after the Closing Date.



11.5 Confidentiality and Public Announcements. This Agreement and the terms
and provisions hereof, including the Base Merger Consideration, shall be
maintained confidential by WandT and KMG until Closing; provided, however, that
this Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof may be disclosed to WandTs
lenders, if any, and their consultants, who shall be required to keep such
information confidential. If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing,
following such termination, the parties agree to keep all terms of this
transaction confidential. Neither party may make press releases or other
public announcements concerning this transaction, without the other partys
prior written approval and agreement to the form of the announcement, except
as may be required by applicable laws or rules and regulation of any



 

42 governmental agency or stock exchange (in which case the proposed disclosure
shall be made available to the non-disclosing party prior to such
disclosure). Notwithstanding the foregoing, KMG and WandT shall each have the
right to also disclose the transaction as it deems necessary to comply with
SEC reporting requirements or to customary recipients of either partys
investor relations communications in the normal course of its business;
provided, however, the disclosing party shall prior to such disclosure make
the proposed disclosure available to the non-disclosing party (redacted of
any material, non-public information contained therein not specifically
related to the Merger or the Property).



11.6 Suspense Accounts. If, at Closing, funds are being held in suspense for
the benefit of third parties with respect to the Property (" _Suspense
Accounts_ "), then at Closing or as soon as practical thereafter, KMG shall
transfer to WandT or Surviving Entity all such funds held in suspense related to
proceeds of production and attributable to third parties interests in the
Leases or lands pooled or unitized therewith or Hydrocarbon production from
the Leases or lands pooled or unitized therewith (but not including any
suspended funds relating to any Claims described in _Exhibit C_ ), including
funds suspended awaiting minimum disbursement requirements, funds suspended
under division orders and funds suspended for title and other defects. WandT or
Surviving Entity agrees to administer all such Suspense Accounts and assume
all payment obligations to the proper parties in accordance with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, which obligations (including
obligations related to the sufficiency of the suspended amounts) shall be
included in Surviving Entitys Assumed Obligations to the extent related to
periods after the Closing Date, and shall be included in KMGs Retained
Obligations to the extent related to periods prior to the Closing Date.



11.7 Marks and Logos; Post-Closing Inspections. With respect to any portion
of the Property that KMG operates on behalf of KMG Sub, WandT agrees that within
thirty (30) days after Closing or within thirty (30) days after operations are
actually transferred, whichever is later, it will remove or cause to be
removed the names and marks used by KMG and/or KMG Sub or any of KMGs other
affiliates and all variations and derivatives thereof and logos relating
thereto from the Property and will not thereafter make any use whatsoever of
such names, marks and logos. If WandT fails to comply with this _Section
11.7_, KMG shall have access to the Property in order to remove such names,
marks, and logos, all at WandTs expense. KMG at its sole cost shall have the
right at any time after Closing to reasonable access to the Property for the
purpose of inspecting WandTs compliance with the terms of this Agreement;
provided, however, KMG shall repair any damage to the Property resulting from
such inspections and any such access shall be covered by KMGs indemnity set
forth in _Section 8.4_.
