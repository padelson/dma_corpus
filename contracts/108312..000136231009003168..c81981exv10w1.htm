that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service shall also apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or the

option to acquire the portion of such entity engaged in the Restricted Business (the

Purchasers at any time during the sixth (6<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP>) month after the date of Seller&#146;s
Acquisition by written notice to Sellers of such exercise; thereafter, such option shall lapse and

the aggregate purchase price, including liabilities assumed, paid by Sellers or their Affiliate for
its interest in the Acquired Entity multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the

mutually satisfactory definitive agreement for such purchase and the obtaining of all necessary
governmental approvals and material third party consents (in each case at no out of pocket cost or
expense to Sellers), and to the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods
(including any extensions thereof) required under the HSR Act, without the threat or initiation of
legal action by the FTC or the Antitrust Division. Sellers&#146; representations in the definitive
purchaser and sale agreement concerning the Restricted Portion would be limited to reasonable
assurances that Sellers had caused the Restricted Portion to be operated in the ordinary course of
business during the period of Sellers&#146; ownership. The definitive purchase and sale agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby could be terminated at the option of either Sellers or their
respective Affiliate, on the one hand, or Purchasers, on the other if such transactions were not
consummated by the end of the third (3<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">rd</SUP>) month following the exercise of Sellers&#146;
option therefor. If Purchasers do not exercise the option described in this Section&nbsp;10.3(a)(ii) or
if the sale of the Restricted Portion contemplated hereby is not consummated other than because of
Sellers&#146; default, Sellers may retain ownership of the Acquired Entity, including the Restricted
Portion, without further obligation to Purchasers hereunder.

to the first sentence of Section&nbsp;14.3(a)(ii), then (1)&nbsp;such Claim will be deemed to be an
indemnifiable claim under Article&nbsp;XIV, (2)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party will assume all liability related
to such Claim, except as set forth in Section&nbsp;14.3(a)(ii)(E), (3)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party will be
relieved of all liability related to such Claim, except as set forth in Section&nbsp;14.3(a)(ii)(E), (4)
the Indemnifying Party may assume the sole defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party, and may compromise or settle such claim as it deems appropriate, and (5)
the Indemnifying Party forever waives the right to assert a defense to any indemnification claim
under Article&nbsp;XIV with respect to the Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no compromise or
settlement of such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party&#146;s
consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if: (1)&nbsp;there is
any finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of rights of any person or any
effect on any other claim that may be made against the Indemnified Party; or (2)&nbsp;any relief
provided is other than monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in connection with such Claim, the Indemnified Party determines
that there is a reasonable probability that: (1)&nbsp;there will be a finding or admission of any
violation of Law or any violation of rights of any person, or there is any effect on any other
claim that may be made against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party may, by notice to
the Indemnifying Party, assume the right to co-defend, compromise and settle such Claim and the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of such Claim so defended or any
compromise or settlement so effected without its consent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); or (2)&nbsp;any relief provided will be other than monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the
Indemnifying Party, assume the right to co-defend, compromise and settle such Claim and, with
respect to non-monetary damages, take the lead in defending, compromising and settling such Claim,
provided that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of such Claim so
defended or any compromise or settlement so effected without its consent (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 16%">B.&nbsp;Indemnifying Party Declines to Assume Defense. If the Indemnifying Party sends a Response
in which it declines to assume defense of the Claim or if it fails to deliver a Claim Response
within the Response Period, then the Indemnified Party may assume the sole defense of such Claim,
and unless the Indemnified Party first receives an Assumption Notice, may compromise or settle such
claim as it deems appropriate, and assert an indemnity claim against the Indemnifying Party for
Damages arising from or related to such Claim pursuant to this Article&nbsp;XIV, and the Indemnifying
Party will be bound by any determination made in such Claim or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Indemnified Party if it is determined that the Indemnifying Party is liable
therefor.

defense of the Reserved Claim (a &#147;<B>New Information Assumption Notice</B>&#148;), or (B)&nbsp;decline to assume the
sole defense of the Reserved Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not receive such a written

to assume the sole defense of the Reserved Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence. If the
Indemnified Party delivers a New Information Assumption Notice, then it will be prohibited from

available to the party making the claim. To the extent such Indemnity Claim does not give rise to
a currently realizable Tax Benefit, if the amount with respect to which any Indemnity Claim is made
gives rise to a subsequently realized Tax Benefit to the party that made the claim, such party
shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit when, as and if realized.
For the purposes of this Agreement, any subsequently realized Tax Benefit shall be treated as
though it were a reduction in the amount of the initial Indemnity Claim, and the liabilities of the
parties shall be redetermined as though both occurred at or prior to the time of the indemnity
payment. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;14.3(c), a &#147;<B>Tax Benefit</B>&#148; means an amount by which the Tax
liability of the party (or group of corporations including the party) is reduced (including, by
deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased Tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to
refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant Taxing authority.
Where a party has other losses, deductions, credits or items available to it, the Tax Benefit from
any losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the Indemnity Claims shall be deemed to be

reasonably anticipated that such Tax Benefit shall be realized in the current Taxable period or

that there should be a determination disallowing the Tax Benefit, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related reduction previously allowed or
payments previously made to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section&nbsp;14.3(c). The amount of
the refunded reduction or payment shall be deemed a payment under Sections&nbsp;14.1 and 14.2 of this
Agreement and thus shall be paid subject to any applicable reductions under this Section&nbsp;14.3(c).
