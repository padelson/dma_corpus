in Section 1.4(c),  _minus_ the aggregate amount of Estimated Net
Indebtedness as set forth on the Estimated Statement. 

   

1.4. _Estimated Adjustments_. 

  

(a) _Estimated Statement_. Within five (5), but no fewer than three (3),
business days before the Closing Date, U.S. Seller will prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and deliver to U.S. Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated
Statement") setting forth a good faith estimate, as of the Closing Date, of
(i) the Net Working Capital (such estimate, the "Estimated Net Working
Capital") prepared in accordance with GAAP Consistently Applied and (ii) the
aggregate amount of Net Indebtedness (the "Estimated Net Indebtedness"). The
Estimated Statement will be subject to U.S. Purchasers approval, which will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If U.S. Purchaser and
U.S. Seller cannot agree on the Estimated Net Working Capital or the Estimated
Net Indebtedness, then U.S. Sellers estimated values of such items, proposed
in good faith, will be the estimated values of such items used only for
purposes of calculating the closing payment described in Section 1.3 of this
Agreement and will be subject to post-closing adjustments as set forth in
Section 1.5 of this Agreement. U.S. Seller will promptly provide U.S.
Purchaser with such documents and information as U.S. Purchaser reasonably
requests in connection with its review of the Estimated Statement. 

  

(b) _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the following terms will have
the following meanings:

accounting principles ("GAAP"), except as set forth on _Schedule 1.4_, as
consistently applied by U.S. Seller. 

  

(ii) "Indebtedness" means, without duplication, the Global Businesss (A)
obligations, including principal and interest, with respect to borrowed money
outstanding as of the time indicated, together with all prepayment premiums
or penalties and other amounts becoming due as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions, (B) payment obligations evidenced by a bond, note, debenture or
similar instrument (including a purchase money obligation) which are not
evidencing trade payables, (C) payment obligations of money relating to
leases that U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller have classified as a capitalized lease
obligation in accordance with GAAP Consistently Applied, (D) payment
obligations for the deferred purchase price for purchases of property outside
the ordinary course of business arising in connection with transactions
occurring prior to the Closing which are not evidencing trade payables, (E)
unfunded obligations under any employee retirement benefit plan,

determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Financial

U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller or a Non-Purchased Affiliate, on the other hand),

(v) "Target Net Working Capital" means $75,300,000. 

  

(c) _Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, then the payment to
Sellers provided in Section 1.3 will be reduced by the amount of such
shortfall, subject to further adjustment as provided in Section 1.5. If the
Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working Capital,
then the payment to Sellers provided in Section 1.3 will be increased by the
amount of such excess, subject to further adjustment as provided in Section
1.5. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

1.5. _Post-Closing Adjustments_. 

   

(a) _Closing Statements_. 

  

(i) As soon as practicable, but in any event not more than ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, unless otherwise extended by the mutual agreement of
U.S. Seller and U.S. Purchaser, U.S. Seller will cause to be prepared and
delivered to U.S. Purchaser (A) a statement (the "Closing Statement of
Working Capital"), setting forth, as of the Closing Date, the Net Working
Capital (the "Closing Net Working Capital"); and (B) a statement (the
"Closing Statement of Indebtedness") setting forth, as of the Closing Date,
the aggregate amount of the Net Indebtedness (the "Closing Net
Indebtedness"); together with an audit report of Ernst and Young,
LLP, independent accountants of Seller and Company ("EandY"), to the effect
that the Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Net Indebtedness have
been calculated in accordance with this Agreement and the Closing Statement
of Working Capital has been prepared in accordance with GAAP
Consistently Applied. 

  

(ii) For purposes of U.S. Sellers preparation of the Closing Statement of
Working Capital and the Closing Statement of Indebtedness (collectively, the
"Closing Statements"), U.S. Purchaser (A) shall cause the Vice President of
Finance (or comparable officer) of Company to provide or cause to be provided
to U.S. Seller, within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, a balance sheet
as of the Closing Date, along with a copy of all data and supporting
documentation reasonably necessary for preparation of the Closing Statements,
including financial information normally submitted by Company to U.S. Seller
using its Hyperion Financial Management System; and (B) shall not prevent the
appropriate members of management of Company from providing (and shall request
that they provide), within five (5) days after the request of U.S. Seller
therefor, customary management representation letters to EandY for purposes of
EandYs audit report on the Closing Statement of Working Capital. All costs and
expenses incurred by U.S. Seller in connection with the preparation, delivery
and audit of the Closing Statements shall be borne by Sellers.
Purchasers shall make available all reasonable books, records and personnel
for U.S. Seller to prepare the Closing Statements. 

  

(b) _Acceptance or Dispute; Resolution_. U.S. Purchaser may dispute any
amount reflected on the Closing Statement of Working Capital or the Closing
Statement of Indebtedness;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any dispute of any
amounts reflected on the Closing Statement of Working Capital must involve a
proposed adjustment (i) of $100,000 or more with respect to any single item
or series of items arising from the same or substantially the same facts and
(ii) of $1,000,000 or more in the aggregate (not taking into account those
single items or series of items arising from the same or substantially the
same facts determined to be less than $100,000); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that U.S. Purchaser shall notify U.S. Seller in writing (the "Dispute
Notice") of each disputed item within forty-five (45) days of
U.S. Purchasers receipt of the Closing Statements, specifying the amount
thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the following:
(i) (A) with respect to each disputed item in the Closing Statement of
Working Capital, why U.S. Purchaser believes such amount was not prepared on
a basis consistent with GAAP Consistently Applied and (B) with respect to
each item disputed in the Closing Statement of Indebtedness, why U.S.
Purchaser believes the amount of Net Indebtedness reflected therein was not
prepared on a basis consistent with this Agreement, and (ii) the amount of
each such disputed item as determined by the U.S. Purchaser. U.S. Purchaser
shall submit only one (1) Dispute Notice with respect to the Closing
Statements containing all disputed items with respect thereto. If U.S.
Purchaser does not deliver a Dispute Notice within forty-five (45) days after
the date of receipt by U.S. Purchaser of the Closing Statements, the Closing
Statements delivered by U.S. Seller to U.S. Purchaser shall be deemed to be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event U.S. Purchaser
delivers to U.S. Seller a Dispute Notice within the required time, U.S.
Purchaser and U.S. Seller shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and
any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive. If U.S.  

  

    ##### 

  

   

Purchaser and U.S. Seller are unable to reach a resolution with such effect
within fifteen (15) days of the receipt by U.S. Seller of the Dispute Notice,
on the written demand of U.S. Purchaser or U.S. Seller, the items remaining
in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to a senior partner of
PricewaterhouseCoopers agreed to by U.S. Seller and U.S. Purchaser (the
"Accounting Arbitrator") who shall arbitrate any such disputes. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall determine whether, with respect to the disputed
items, the Closing Statements were prepared (I) with regard to the Closing
Statement of Working Capital, on a basis consistent with GAAP Consistently
Applied, and (II) with regard to the Closing Statement of Net Indebtedness, on
a basis consistent with this Agreement. Within sixty (60) days after his or
her appointment, the Accounting Arbitrator shall make a final written
determination and award, upon such remaining disputed items ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Accounting Arbitrator shall not make an award that
includes an adjustment for a disputed item in an amount in excess of the
amount actually claimed by U.S. Purchaser in respect of such item in the
Dispute Notice or that is inconsistent with this Section 1.5), and such
determination and award shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto, and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. All
fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator in resolving the dispute shall
be allocated between U.S. Purchaser and U.S. Seller such that the amount paid
by U.S. Purchaser bears the same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount
unsuccessfully disputed by U.S. Purchaser bears to the total dollar amount of
the disputed items that were submitted for resolution to the
Accounting Arbitrator, and U.S. Seller shall pay the balance. The arbitration
shall be held in accordance with the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in
effect (the "Arbitration Rules"), except as modified herein. If U.S. Seller
and U.S. Purchaser fail to agree on an Accounting Arbitrator within fifteen
(15) days of receipt by either party of a demand for arbitration under this
Section 1.5(b), on the request of either party, such arbitration shall be
submitted to the AAA, which shall appoint an Accounting Arbitrator in
accordance with the following: (i) if PricewaterhouseCoopers is not the
auditor of U.S. Seller, U.K. Seller, U.S. Purchaser, U.K. Purchaser or
Company, the AAA shall select a senior partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers
resident in the New York or Chicago offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the
Accounting Arbitrator; and (ii) if PricewaterhouseCoopers is the auditor of
U.S. Seller, U.K. Seller, U.S. Purchaser, U.K. Purchaser or Company, the AAA
shall select the Accounting Arbitrator using the listing, striking and
ranking method in the Arbitration Rules; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
AAA may only select the Accounting Arbitrator from its New York City and
Chicago rosters. Any time period contained in this section or in
the Arbitration Rules may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties or
by the Accounting Arbitrator for good cause shown. The arbitration shall be
held, and the award shall be issued, in New York City, New York. 

  

(c) _Items Not in Dispute_. Notwithstanding any dispute pursuant to Section
1.5(b) of any amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.5, the applicable party
shall pay that portion of the amounts payable by it pursuant to this Section
1.5 that are not subject at the time of such payment to any dispute
immediately upon the delivery of a Dispute Notice. Any amount payable
following resolution of a matter specified in a Dispute Notice shall be paid,
together with interest thereon as provided in Section 1.5(f), within ten (10)
business days following the resolution thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
recipient party. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
Section 1.5, each party will cooperate with and make available to the other
party and its respective Representatives, during normal business hours and
without undue disruption to their day-to-day business, all non-privileged
information, records, data and working papers, and will permit access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to its facilities
and personnel as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Closing Statements and the resolution of any
disputes thereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect to
consolidated, combined, unitary, affiliated or similar Tax Returns which
include U.S. Seller and any of its Affiliates other than the Company (a "Non-
Purchased Affiliate"), U.S. Purchaser shall only have access to portions of
such Tax Returns relevant to Company. 

   

(e) _Adjustment_. The Purchase Price will be: 

  

(i) adjusted downward by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds the Closing Net Working Capital, as agreed to by the
parties or determined pursuant to this Section 1.5; 

  

(ii) adjusted upward by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working
Capital is less than the Closing Net Working Capital, as agreed to by the
parties or determined pursuant to this Section 1.5; 

  

(iii) adjusted downward by the amount, if any, by which Closing Net
Indebtedness, as agreed to by the parties or determined pursuant to this
Section 1.5, exceeds the Estimated Net Indebtedness; and 

  

(iv) adjusted upward by the amount, if any, by which Closing Net Indebtedness,
as agreed to by the parties or determined pursuant to this Section 1.5, is
less than the Estimated Net Indebtedness. 

  

No adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made pursuant to this Section
1.5(e) in respect of a successfully disputed item on the Closing Statement of
Working Capital unless the aggregate amount of successfully disputed items
(excluding claims for any single item or series of items arising from the
same or substantially the same facts determined to be less than $100,000) is
determined to exceed $1,000,000, in which case all such amounts shall be
payable. 

   

(f) _Payment_. 

  

(i) _Net Decrease; Payment by Seller_. If there is a net decrease in the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5(e), then within five (5) business days
of the date when the Closing Statements become final under Section 1.5(b),
Sellers will pay to Purchasers an amount of cash equal to the amount of such
reduction, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date until paid at
the Interest Rate, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Purchasers. " _Interest Rate_ " shall mean
the Bloomberg Prime Rate on the Closing Date as quoted by the Bloomberg
Terminal screen PRIMBB INDEX, calculated on the basis of a 365 day year and
charged for the actual number of days elapsed. 

  

(ii) _Net Increase; Payment by Purchaser_. If there is a net increase in the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5(e), then within five (5) business days
of the date when the Closing Statements become final under Section 1.5(b),
Purchasers will pay an amount in cash equal to such increase to Sellers,
together with interest thereon from the Closing Date until paid at the
Interest Rate by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Sellers. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

1.6. _U.K. Value Added Tax ("VAT")_.. The U.K. Seller and the U.K. Purchaser
consider that the sale by the U.K. Seller of the Purchased Assets to the U.K.
Purchaser with a view to the U.K. Purchaser carrying on the U.K. Business is
one to which the provisions of paragraph 5 of the Value Added Tax (Special
Provisions) Order 1995 (the "VAT Order") applies, and accordingly: 

  

(a) the U.K. Seller and the U.K. Purchaser will each use its reasonable
endeavours to ensure that the transfer to the U.K. Purchaser of the Purchased
Assets under this Agreement is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a
supply of services for the purposes of VAT; 

  

(b) no amount in respect of VAT will be paid by the U.S. Purchaser or the U.K.
Purchaser upon payment of the Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets, but if
the U.K. Seller is notified by H.M. Revenue and Customs or any other relevant
UK taxation authority ("HMRC") that it considers that paragraph 5 of the VAT
Order does not apply, the U.K. Seller will (on being indemnified against
all costs reasonably and properly incurred) take such reasonable action as
the U.K. Purchaser may request to ensure that HMRC agrees that the sale is
one to which paragraph 5 of the VAT Order applies. If HMRC determines that
VAT is chargeable on the sale of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement or
the U.K. Purchaser decides not to protest any demand by HMRC for VAT, then
the Purchaser shall pay, in addition to the Purchase Price, VAT (including
any interest and/or penalties for late payment, save to the extent that such
interest and/or penalties arise as a result of the breach by the Sellers of
the representations and warranties provided under this Agreement) on the sale
of the Purchased Assets against the delivery by the U.K. Seller to the
U.K. Purchaser of a valid VAT invoice in respect thereof, by payment to the
U.K. Seller within five (5) days of the receipt of such invoice; and 

  

(c) unless HMRC has otherwise directed, for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Closing the U.K. Seller will preserve the VAT Records as
required by law. On being given reasonable notice by the U.K. Purchaser, the
U.K. Seller will make those VAT Records available to the U.K. Purchaser or
its agents for inspection and copying as required by law. 

  

1.7. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties will allocate the Purchase
Price and the Assumed Liabilities among the Shares and Purchased Assets in
accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule 15.12(a)_ 
_(Allocation)_. Sellers and Purchasers shall: (a) prepare and file, and cause
their respective Affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax returns on a basis
consistent with such allocation schedule and (b) not take any position, or
cause or permit their respective Affiliates to take any position for tax
purposes inconsistent with such allocation schedule.

of any such Assumed Contracts whose terms would be breached by an assignment
or attempted assignment;

(ii) the assignment of each Assumed Contract will be conditional upon such
consent being obtained and the U.K. Seller will use all reasonable endeavours
to obtain such consent as soon as reasonably possible after the Closing;

of the U.K. Purchaser and will use all reasonable endeavours to make

receipt the benefits accruing or arising thereunder; (B) the U.K. Purchaser
shall perform, in place of the U.K. Seller, any such Assumed Contract as
subcontractor, licensee or sublicensee (as appropriate) of the U.K. Seller to

required and authorised so to do by the U.K. Purchaser and will not without
the U.K. Purchasers express prior written consent (such consent not to be

release or waiver or settlement of or otherwise take any action in relation to
any such Assumed Contracts or any other rights arising under the same; and 

  

(iv) in any case where (A) the consent of a third party is required in

consent is not forthcoming or is refused, or (B) under the terms of any
particular Assumed Contract, the U.K. Purchaser is not permitted to perform
the U.K. Sellers obligations as subcontractor, licensee or sublicensee (as
appropriate) or agent, the U.K. Seller and the U.K. Purchaser shall use all
reasonable endeavours to make such arrangements as may be reasonably
acceptable to the U.K. Purchaser and the U.K. Seller for assuring to the U.K.
Purchaser the benefit and the associated obligations of such Assumed Contract
including with the consent of both parties, by terminating such Assumed
Contract (provided that liability for any payment made or loss suffered or
incurred by the U.K. Seller or the U.K. Purchaser for such purpose shall be
borne in equal shares by the U.K. Seller and the U.K. Purchaser). 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, such
cooperation shall not include any requirement on the part of U.K. Seller to
expend money, commence or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodations (financial or otherwise) to any third party. In the event that
U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller is required to guarantee, or otherwise remain
liable for, the performance by U.K. Purchaser or Company of any such Assumed

or assign, or extend or renew the term of, any such Assumed Contract, or
permit any such Assumed Contract to be modified, amended or assigned or the
term of any such Assumed Contract to be extended or renewed, unless
concurrently therewith Sellers are expressly released from any and all
further obligation in respect of such guarantee or Assumed Contract.

respect or in the case of any Seller Fundamental Representation, in any
respect, as of the date of this Agreement, or if such party becomes aware of

benefits substantially identical to those provided for salaried Employees
participating in the Textron Master Retirement Plan Addendum A ("Sellers
Salaried Pension Benefit Plan"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not be construed to limit the ability of U.S. Purchaser or
such Affiliate to amend or terminate Purchasers Salaried Pension Plan or the
benefits provided thereunder at any time or from time to time following the
Closing in any manner, subject to compliance with applicable Law and Section
9.2. Subject to the transfer of assets described in Section 9.3(a)(iv),

Closing Date for the benefits of all Employees (and their eligible
beneficiaries) participating in the Sellers Salaried Pension Benefit Plan. 

  

(ii) _Retirement Account Plan_. With respect to the Textron, Inc. Retirement
Account Plan ("Sellers Companion Defined Contribution Plan"), a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan of U.S. Seller linked to Sellers
Salaried Pension Benefit Plan, U.S. Purchaser shall establish or designate a
tax-qualified defined contribution plan ("Purchasers Companion Defined
Contribution Plan") providing benefits substantially identical to those
provided for salaried Employees participating in Sellers Companion Defined
Contribution Plan, which plan shall be linked to Purchasers Salaried Pension
Plan in the same manner as Sellers Companion Defined Contribution Plan is
linked to Sellers Salaried Pension Benefit Plan; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not be construed to limit the ability of U.S. Purchaser or
such Affiliate to amend or terminate Purchasers Companion Defined
Contribution Plan or the benefits provided thereunder at any time or from
time to time following the Closing in any manner, subject to compliance
with applicable Law and Section 9.2. Following the Closing, on or about the

Contribution Plan to transfer to the trustee of Purchasers Companion Defined
Contribution Plan assets (in cash) in an amount equal to the account
balances (whether or not vested), valued as of the day before the actual
asset transfer date, of each salaried Employee then participating in Sellers
Companion Defined Contribution Plan. Upon such transfer of assets,
Purchasers Companion Defined Contribution Plan shall assume all
liabilities for benefits accrued as of the date of such transfer under
Sellers Companion Defined Contribution Plan in respect of such individuals
and Sellers Companion Defined Contribution Plan shall be relieved of all
such liabilities. 

  

(iii) _Hourly Pension Plan_. U.S. Purchaser or an Affiliate of U.S. Purchaser
shall establish, or amend an existing pension plan, as of the Closing Date,
or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, to include, a tax-qualified
defined benefit plan ("Purchasers Hourly Pension Plan") providing benefits
substantially identical to those provided for hourly Employees participating
in the Textron Master Retirement Plan Addendum V ("Sellers Hourly Master
Pension Benefit Plan", and together with Sellers Salaried Pension Benefit
Plan, "Sellers Pension Plans"); provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not be construed to limit the ability of U.S. Purchaser or such Affiliate to
amend or terminate Purchasers Hourly Pension Plan or the benefits
provided thereunder at any time or from time to time following the Closing in
any manner, subject to compliance with applicable Law or collective
bargaining agreements and Section 9.2. Subject to the transfer of assets
described in Section 9.3(a)(iv), Purchasers Hourly Pension Plan shall
assume the liabilities as of the Closing Date for the benefits of all
Employees (and their eligible beneficiaries) participating in Sellers Hourly
Master Pension Benefit Plan. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(iv) _Transfer of Pension Assets_. On a day which is within ninety (90) days
after the latest of (A) the date upon which U.S. Purchaser delivers to U.S.
Seller notice that U.S. Purchasers actuaries, pursuant to Section 9.3(a) of
this Agreement, have reviewed the calculations of U.S. Sellers actuaries and
are satisfied that such calculations are in accordance with this Agreement,
or (B) the day upon which U.S. Purchaser delivers to U.S. Seller a copy of a
favorable IRS determination letter or an opinion, reasonably satisfactory to
U.S. Sellers counsel, of U.S. Purchasers counsel, in either case, to the
effect that the terms of Purchasers Salaried Pension Plan and Purchasers
Hourly Pension Plan and their related trusts qualify, as to form,
under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code, or (C) the day upon
which U.S. Seller delivers to Purchaser a copy of a favorable IRS
determination letter or an opinion, reasonably satisfactory to U.S.
Purchasers counsel, of U.S. Sellers counsel, in either case, to the effect
that the terms of the Textron Master Retirement Plan and related trust (as
each has been amended to date) qualify, as to form, under Section 401(a) and
Section 501(a) of the Code, U.S. Seller shall cause the trustee under
Sellers Salaried Pension Benefit Plan and the Sellers Hourly Master Pension
Benefit Plan trust ("Sellers Trustee") to transfer to the trustee of
Purchasers Salaried Pension Plan and Purchasers Hourly Pension Plan
("Purchasers Trustee"), respectively, assets in an amount equal to the
amount in respect of the applicable plan computed pursuant to Section
9.3(a)(v), but not less than the amount necessary to satisfy the applicable
requirements of Sections 414(1) and 401(a)(12) of the Code, which amount will
be calculated using the actuarial assumptions and methodologies set forth in
Section 9.3(a)(v). 

  

(v) _Calculation of Transferred Amount of Asset Transfer_. The assets to be
transferred from Sellers Trustee to Purchasers Trustee shall be cash only
and, subject to Section 9.3(b), shall equal the present value as of the
Closing Date of the accumulated benefit obligation as of the Closing Date of
the Employees participating in Sellers Salaried Pension Benefit Plan
and Sellers Hourly Master Pension Benefit Plan. The calculation of the
present value of the accumulated benefit obligation will be calculated using
the schedule of participants in such plans set forth on _Schedule 9.3(a)(v)_
(as updated by Seller through the Closing Date) and by applying (A) a
discount rate determined by (x) taking the discount rate of 6.25% utilized in
U.S. Sellers January 3, 2009 audited disclosure prepared for purpose of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 87 published by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("Sellers FAS 87 Audit Disclosure"),
(y) adjusting such rate up or down to reflect the difference in the Citigroup
Pension Liability Index from December 31, 2008 to the end of the month
coincident with or immediately preceding the Closing Date and (z) rounding
such rate up, if necessary, to the next basis point evenly divisible by five
and (B) other actuarial assumptions, methods and methodologies utilized in
such Sellers FAS 87 Audit Disclosure and as set forth in _Schedule
9.3(a)(iv)_. 

  

(b) The amounts so determined in Section 9.3(a)(v) shall be adjusted for
investment earnings at the actual investment return (net of investment
management fees) of the Textron Master Retirement Plan Trust for the period
between the Closing Date and the date on which assets are transferred from
the Textron Master Retirement Plan Trust to a trust established by U.S.
Purchaser to fund Purchasers Pension Plans, as described in Section
9.3(a)(iv), and reduced by the amount of any benefit payments to Employees
and their beneficiaries during such period and a proportionate share, based
on asset value, of administrative expenses (including actual expenses of any
paying agent) for such period if such administrative expenses are charged to
Sellers Pension Plans. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) The assets caused to be transferred pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(iv) shall
be calculated by U.S. Sellers actuary, and shall be subject to review by
U.S. Purchasers actuary for the purpose of confirming that the calculation
was made in accordance with (1) the actuarial assumptions and methods set
forth in Section 9.3(a)(v), or Section 9.3(a)(iv) if necessary, and on 
_Schedule 9.3(a)(iv)_ and (2) generally accepted actuarial practice. As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, U.S. Seller shall provide U.S.
Purchaser with a detailed summary of the calculations described in Section
9.3(a)(v), or Section 9.3(a)(iv) if necessary, and any back-up data
reasonably requested by U.S. Purchaser. If U.S. Purchaser or U.S. Purchasers
actuary does not notify U.S. Seller to the contrary within sixty (60) days
after the delivery to U.S. Purchaser of such detailed summary and data, the
calculations of U.S. Sellers actuary pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(v), or
Section 9.3(a)(iv) if necessary, shall be deemed to be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. If, however, U.S. Purchaser notifies U.S. Seller
in writing within such period that it and its actuaries believe that the
calculations were not prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section
9.3(a)(v), or Section 9.3(a)(iv) if necessary, and such notice specifies (i)
the precise items of the calculations challenged, (ii) the basis of the
challenge and (iii) the amount of the adjustment they propose with respect to
each such item, the parties will then attempt to resolve their differences
with respect thereto. U.S. Purchaser shall only be entitled to dispute any
individual item that involves a proposed adjustment of more than twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000) and only to the extent that all disputed items
exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) exceed, in the aggregate,
one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). If the parties are unable to resolve
their dispute within ninety (90) days after the date U.S. Purchaser notifies
U.S. Seller of the disputed items, the disputed items shall be submitted for
resolution to a partner or senior executive of an Independent Actuary Firm
(the "Actuary Arbitrator") who shall arbitrate any such dispute. The term
"Independent Actuary Firm" shall mean an internationally recognized benefits
consulting firm which shall have no direct interest in either of U.S. Seller
or U.S. Purchaser or the outcome of the dispute and shall not have been
retained by U.S. Seller or U.S. Purchaser for a period of at least five (5)
years, or such other benefits consulting firm mutually acceptable to U.S.
Purchaser and U.S. Seller. The Actuary Arbitrator shall be asked to resolve
such disputes and report his or her final determination thereupon in writing
to U.S. Seller and U.S. Purchaser within sixty (60) days after such referral.
The written determination of the Actuary Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties hereto, and may be entered and enforced in any
court having jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Actuary Arbitrator in
resolving the dispute shall be borne equally by the parties. The arbitration
shall be held in accordance with the Arbitration Rules, except as modified
herein. If U.S. Seller and U.S. Purchaser fail to agree on an Actuary
Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of receipt by either party of a demand
for arbitration under this Section 9.3(c), on the request of any party, such
arbitration shall be submitted to the AAA, which shall appoint an Actuary
Arbitrator using the listing, striking and ranking method in the Arbitration
Rules;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the AAA may only select the Actuary
Arbitrator from its New York and Chicago rosters. Any time period contained
herein or in the Arbitration Rules may be extended by mutual agreement of the
parties or by the Actuary Arbitrator for good cause shown. The arbitration
shall be held, and the award shall be issued in New York City, New York. 

  

9.4. _Defined Contribution Plan_. The accounts under the Textron Savings Plan
of all Employees shall be nonforfeitable on the Closing Date, and shall be
distributable in accordance with the terms of that plan. To the extent
necessary, U.S. Seller shall amend the Textron Savings Plan to permit any
Employee with an outstanding loan under such plan as of the Closing Date
to continue to repay such loan after the Closing Date for the duration of its
term. U.S. Purchaser shall not assume any liability or have responsibility
with respect to the Textron Savings Plan. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

9.5. _Severance and Other Liability_. 

  

(a) Sellers shall retain and be solely liable for and shall indemnify and hold
Purchasers harmless from and against all obligations, costs or expenses
related to the Employee Benefit Plans or any other employee benefit plan or
arrangement maintained or contributed to by U.K. Seller or by U.S. Seller or
its Affiliates or other entity treated as single employer with U.S. Seller or
any Affiliate under Section 414(a), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or under
which Sellers or their affiliates have any liability, except with respect to
any liabilities under the Employee Benefit Plans expressly assumed by
Purchasers under this Agreement. Purchasers shall assume, discharge, pay and
be solely liable for and shall indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and
against all obligation, cost or expense for (i) any earned vacation or
holiday pay relating to Employees and Former Employees to the extent
reflected on the Closing Statement of Working Capital or arising after the
Closing Date; (ii) any other fringe benefits relating to Employees and Former
Employees whether or not on the Closing Statement of Working Capital; (iii)
any health, disability or life insurance coverage and any medical and dental
benefits (including retiree medical and life insurance coverage) payable at
any time to Employees and Former Employees; (iv) severance pay, termination
indemnity pay, salary continuation, special bonuses or like compensation under
Sellers Employee Benefit Plans, or under applicable Law, relating to
Employees and Former Employees to the extent such liability is reflected on
the Closing Statement of Working Capital or arises after Closing Date.
Purchasers shall continue to employ immediately following the Closing all of
the Employees. The provisions of this Section 9.5 shall not be construed to
limit the ability of Purchasers to terminate any Employee at any time
following the Closing for any reason, subject to compliance with applicable
Laws and contracts, including, but not limited to TUPE, the WARN Act
and similar state and local Laws. Where there is any conflict in respect of
the U.K. Employees between the provisions of this Section 9.5(a) and the
provisions of Section 9.5(b) and 9.13, the provisions of Section 9.5(b) and
9.13 (as applicable) shall prevail. 

  

(b) The U.K. Seller and the U.K. Purchaser acknowledge and agree that this
Agreement and the purchase of the Purchased Assets constitutes a relevant
transfer for the purposes of TUPE and that the contracts of employment of
each of the U.K. Employees will have effect from the Closing Date as if
originally made between the U.K. Purchaser and the U.K. Employees. 

  

(c) Subject to applicable privacy Laws, U.S. Seller and its Affiliates shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with U.S. Purchaser in
its acquisition of stop-loss insurance covering health benefits to be
provided during any transition period under the Transition Agreement
following Closing by providing information required by insurance carriers
relating to health benefits provided to Employees and Former Employees, the
cost of providing any such information to be borne by U.S. Purchaser. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

9.6. _Workers  Compensation and Employers Liability_. From and after the
Closing, U.S. Purchaser shall assume, discharge, pay and be solely liable for
all liabilities in respect of any suits, claims, proceedings and actions
pending as of or commenced after the Closing Date resulting from actual or
alleged harm or injury under applicable Workers Compensation Laws
to Employees of Company or Former Employees of Company regardless of when the
incident or accident giving rise to such liability occurred or occurs. U.S.
Purchaser shall make all necessary arrangements to assume all workers
compensation claim files, whether open or closed, as of the Closing Date, and
will make the necessary arrangements for assuming the continued management
of such liabilities, including through entering into a Claims Management
Agreement with U.S. Seller substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 9.6 (the "Claims Management Agreement"). 

  

9.7. _Prior Service Credit_. Following the Closing Date, with respect to each
Employee, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of
Purchasers or their Affiliates, including severance benefits, paid time-off
and vacation entitlement (but not accrual of pension benefits), service prior
to the Closing with the U.S. Seller, U.K. Seller or any Affiliate of either
Seller (or predecessor employers to the extent the U.S. Seller, U.K. Seller
or any Affiliate of either Seller provided past service credit) shall be
treated as service with Purchasers or the applicable Affiliate of Purchasers;
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such
service shall also apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations, provided in the case of any insured benefit to the
extent not prohibited by the insurer. Each such plan shall waive pre-existing
condition limitations to the same extent waived or inapplicable under the
corresponding Global Business plan, provided in the case of any insured
benefit to the extent not prohibited by the insurer. To the extent they
provide such information to Purchasers or their Affiliates or their applicable
plans, Employees shall be given credit under the applicable plan of
Purchasers or any Affiliate thereof for amounts paid under a corresponding
Sellers plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been
paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the successor or
replacement plan. 

  

9.8. _Flexible Spending Accounts_. With respect to the year in which Closing
occurs, or, if later (and to the extent applicable), the date on which U.S.
Sellers provision of transition services under the Transition Agreement with
respect to flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses
ends (the later of such dates being referred to herein as the "FSA Transition
Date"), U.S. Purchaser or an Affiliate of U.S. Purchaser shall establish
flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses under a
new or existing plan established or maintained under Section 125 or Section
129 of the Code, as applicable ("Purchaser FSAs"), effective as of the FSA
Transition Date, for each Employee who as of the FSA Transition Date, is
a participant in a flexible spending account for medical or dependent care
expenses under an Employee Benefit Plan pursuant to Section 125 or Section
129 of the Code ("Seller FSAs"). Within sixty (60) days after the FSA
Transition Date, U.S. Seller shall provide an accounting to U.S. Purchaser
of each applicable Employees account balance in Seller FSAs, in each case as
of the FSA Transition Date. Upon receipt of such accounting, U.S. Purchaser
shall cause each participating Employees account under the Purchaser FSAs to
be credited or debited, as applicable, effective on the day after the FSA
Transition Date, in an amount equal to the applicable account balance of
such Employee under the corresponding Seller FSA as of the FSA Transition
Date. As soon as administratively practicable after the delivery of the
accounting described above, U.S. Seller shall transfer to U.S. 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Purchaser an amount equal to the total contributions made to Seller FSAs by
Employees in respect of the plan year in which the FSA Transition Date
occurs, reduced by an amount equal to the total claims already paid
to Employees under such plans in respect of such plan year; if, however, such
amount is a negative number, U.S. Purchaser shall transfer to U.S. Seller,
within five (5) business days of U.S. Sellers request, an amount equal to
the aggregate deficit balance in such accounts. The Purchaser FSAs shall
continue to provide reimbursements to such Employees for the remainder of the
year in which the FSA Transition Date occurs in accordance with terms not
less favorable than the terms of the corresponding Seller FSAs. U.S.
Purchaser and U.S. Seller intend that the actions to be taken pursuant to
this Section 9.8 be treated as an assumption by U.S. Purchaser of the portion
of Seller FSAs and the elections made thereunder attributable to the
participating Employees. 

  

9.9. _Retention Payment Allocation_. U.S. Purchaser shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions so that U.S. Purchaser (or an Affiliate of U.S.
Purchaser following Closing) shall pay to each applicable Employee the
portion of any Retention Payment (and any employer payroll taxes imposed on
U.S. Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with such payment)
that becomes payable because such Employee remains employed on a 2nd
Retention Date (as defined in the applicable agreement identified on
_Schedule 4.23(k)_) occurring after the Closing Date, equal to the total
amount of such Retention Payment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days between the Closing Date and the 2nd
Retention Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days from
the date of the agreement providing for such Retention Payment and the 2nd
Retention Date. U.S. Seller shall pay (or cause an Affiliate of U.S. Seller
to pay) the balance of each such Retention Payment and taxes and, for the
avoidance of doubt, all Retention Payments that become payable because such
Employee remains employed on a 1st Retention Date (as defined in the
applicable agreement) or a 2nd Retention Date (as defined in such agreement)
that occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. The term "Retention Payment"
shall mean any retention payment provided in any agreement identified on
_Schedule 4.23(k)_. The provisions of this Section 9.9 shall not be
construed to relieve a party of any contractual obligation to pay any
Retention Payment and U.S. Seller and U.S. Purchaser hereby agree to
coordinate in the making of such payments and to make or cause such payment
to be made in accordance with the agreement providing for such payment;
provided, however, that if U.S. Seller or U.S. Purchaser (or an Affiliate of
either party following the Closing) pays a portion of any Retention Payment
and such taxes allocated to the other party under this Section 9.9, the
paying party shall be entitled to reimbursement of such portion of the
Retention Payment and such taxes within ten (10) business days of notifying
the other party of the making of such payment. 

  

9.10. _COBRA Coverage_. U.S. Purchaser shall, commencing on the Closing Date,
provide group health plan continuation coverage described in Section 4980B of
the Code and Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA (together with the regulations
promulgated thereunder "COBRA Coverage") to (a) each Employee of the Company
(and such employees eligible dependents) who becomes eligible for COBRA
Coverage following the Closing and (b) to each Former Employee of the Company
(and such employees eligible dependents) who is receiving or timely elects
COBRA Coverage as of or following the Closing with respect to such employees
service with the Global Business prior to the Closing. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

9.11. _Pensions Act 2004_. The U.K. Purchaser agrees to comply with Sections
257 and 258 of the Pensions Act 2004 in respect of the U.K. Employees. 

  

9.12. _Post-Closing Payments_. Sellers and Purchasers hereby acknowledge that
Sellers following the Closing will have ongoing obligations to make payments
to their respective Employees, including but not limited to Retention
Payments. Purchasers shall cooperate with Sellers in facilitating the making
of these payments and shall, upon the written request of a Seller, pay
or shall cause an Affiliate of Purchasers to pay to Employees any amounts
requested by either of Sellers (including providing for applicable
withholding taxes). Sellers shall, within ten (10) days of notice from U.S.
Purchaser or U.K. Purchaser of the making of any such payment, reimburse
such Purchaser in full for the gross amount of any such payment and cost
incurred by a Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchasers, including any employer
payroll taxes imposed on each Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, in
connection with such payment and shall otherwise hold Purchasers and their
Affiliates harmless with respect to liabilities associated with any such
payment. 

   

9.13. _U.K. Obligations_. 

  

(a) _U.K. Seller s Obligations_. The U.K. Seller shall perform and discharge
all its obligations in respect of all the U.K. Employees for its own account
up to and including the Closing Date. The U.K. Seller shall indemnify the
U.K. Purchaser against all claims, proceedings, amounts, payments (including
those made by way of settlement), losses damages, costs (including reasonable
legal costs), demands, awards, liabilities, interest or expenses
("Employment Liabilities") arising from: 

   

(i) the U.K. Sellers failure to perform and discharge any such obligation; 

  

(ii) the employment or dismissal of any U.K. Employee or any act or omission
by the U.K. Seller in either case on or before the Closing Date; 

  

(iii) a claim made by or in respect of any person employed or formerly
employed by the U.K. Seller other than a U.K. Employee for which it may be
alleged the U.K. Purchaser is liable by virtue of the operation of this
Agreement and/or TUPE; 

  

(iv) except as set forth in this Section 9.13(a)(iv), a complaint of failure
to comply with any requirement of Regulations 11, 13 and 14 of TUPE or in
respect of an award of compensation under Regulations 12 and 15 of TUPE,
provided that this indemnity shall not apply in relation to any complaint or
award which arises from or relates to a failure to commence information
or consultation, or both of them, prior to the signing of this Agreement;
and 

  

(v) provided that the U.K. Purchaser has received no later than 14 days before
the Closing Date (i) copies of terms and conditions of employment relating to
the U.K. Employees, and (ii) details of all benefits, incentive (including
share/share options) and bonus schemes, in which the U.K. Employees
participate, the U.K. Seller shall not be liable for an award of compensation
under Regulation 12 and 15 of TUPE to the extent that such complaint or award
arises from or relates to the U.K. Purchasers failure to comply with its
obligations under Regulation 13(4) of TUPE. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) _U.K. Purchaser s Obligations_. 

  

(i) The U.K. Purchaser shall assume responsibility as the employer of the U.K.
Employees for its own account from the day following the Closing Date and the
U.K. Purchaser shall indemnify the U.K. Seller against all Employment
Liabilities arising from the employment (or any dismissal) of the U.K.
Employees or any act or omission in respect of the U.K. Employees after the
Closing Date except for Employment Liabilities which are the U.K. Sellers
responsibility as set out in this Section 9.13; and 

  

(ii) Subject to the U.K. Purchaser receiving no later than 14 days before the
Closing Date (A) copies of all terms and conditions of employment relating to
the U.K. Employees, and (B) details of all benefits, incentive (including
share/share options) and bonus schemes, in which the U.K. Employees
participate, the U.K. Purchaser shall provide the U.K. Seller with such
information as is required of the U.K. Purchaser by Regulation 13(4) of TUPE
and shall indemnify and keep indemnified the U.K. Seller against any
Employment Liability to the extent that it arises from any breach of this
obligation by U.K. Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. 

  

(c) _Additional U.K. Employees_. If any contract of employment relating to a
person employed or formerly employed by the U.K. Seller other than a U.K.
Employee, or any collective agreement not disclosed to the U.K. Purchaser,
has effect as if originally made between the U.K. Purchaser and that person,
or between the U.K. Purchaser and the relevant party to the
collective agreement, the U.K. Purchaser may terminate the contract or
collective agreement and the U.K. Seller shall indemnify the U.K. Purchaser
against any Employment Liabilities arising out of such termination and
against any sum payable to or in respect of that person in respect of
his employment following the Closing Date and any Employment Liabilities
incurred to or on behalf of the relevant party to the collective agreement,
provided, however, that the U.K. Purchaser shall notify the U.K. Seller
within 21 days of becoming aware of that contract or collective agreement and
that the U.K. Purchaser shall not terminate any such contract before (i)
providing the U.K. Seller with 7 days opportunity to offer that employee a
new contract of employment and (ii) undertaking a statutory dismissal
procedure (to the extent applicable) in relation to that employee. 

  

(d) _Employment Records_. The U.K. Seller will on the Closing Date, deliver
to the U.K. Purchaser all employment records and associated documents
relating to the U.K. Employees which the U.K. Purchaser may reasonably
require. 

  

 _ARTICLE X_ 
  _Obligations After Closing_  

   

10.1. _Access_. In connection with any financial audit of U.S. Seller or U.K.
Seller or any Tax audit or other governmental investigation of U.S. Seller or
U.K. Seller for any matter relating to the Global Business for any period
prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable and lawful purpose,
Purchasers shall cause Company, upon request, to permit Sellers and
their representatives to have access to and to copy, at reasonable times
during normal business hours and in a manner which is not unduly disruptive
to the operations of Company or the U.K. Business, as applicable, the work
papers, books and records of 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Company and the U.K. Business relating the conduct of its business prior to
the Closing which shall have been in possession of Company as of the Closing
and which remain in the possession of Company. Purchasers shall cause Company
not to dispose of such work papers, books and records during the six (6) year
period beginning with the Closing without Sellers consent. Following the
expiration of such six (6) year period, Company may dispose of such work
papers, books and records at any time upon giving ninety (90) days prior
written notice to Sellers, unless Sellers agree to take possession of such
work papers, books and records within such ninety (90) days at no expense to
Purchasers. 

  

10.2. _Textron Name_. Neither Purchasers nor their Affiliates shall use, and
Purchasers shall cause Company to cease using, the name, "Textron," as all or
part of a trade name or otherwise in connection with the Global Business
operations as soon as practicably possible after the Closing Date. Within
three (3) business days after the Closing Date, U.S. Purchaser shall cause
Company to file an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation whereby
"Textron" shall be deleted from its name. Purchasers shall cause the Global
Business to cease, no later than (a) ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
to distribute any trade literature, brochures, bulletins, labels, or
stationery or other similar materials (collectively, "Trade Materials") or
products which have the name, "Textron," thereon without first overprinting
or stickering or otherwise modifying the same to show U.S. Purchaser or U.K.
Purchaser as the owner and source thereof and (b) within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing Date, the use of any mold or die used by
the Global Business in which the name "Textron" is embedded therein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Global Business shall not be
required to overprint, sticker or otherwise modify any references to the name
"Textron" that appear in the books or records or other internal
corporate documents of the Global Business so long as the same remain under
the complete dominion and control of the U.S. Purchaser or the U.K. Purchaser
or their respective Affiliates or successors. Within one hundred eighty (180)
business days after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall cause the
Global Business to reprogram its programmable laser parts marker so that the
name, "Textron," is not imprinted in this manner on Global Business
products; provided, however, that if customer approval is required for such
change, the Global Business may continue to imprint the parts in this
manner until such approval is obtained. Purchasers shall cause the Global
Business diligently to pursue such approval. Purchasers may until not later
than two hundred seventy (270) days following the Closing Date, permit the
Global Business to continue to sell products from the Global
Businesss inventory which have been inscribed with Sellers name prior to
the Closing and after the Closing pursuant to this Section 10.2. Except as
provided above, all use of the name, "Textron" by U.S. Purchaser, U.K.
Purchaser or Company shall cease not later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, and Purchasers shall cause the Global Business to destroy all
Trade Materials bearing the name "Textron" or change such Trade Materials to
delete such identification before such date. Purchasers agree that from and
after the Closing Date, (a) the name and mark "Textron" and all similar
related names and marks (all such names and marks referred to as the "Seller
Names") shall be owned by Sellers or a Non-Purchased Affiliate, (b)
Purchasers may only use the Seller Names in the identical way such Seller
Names were used by the Company or the U.K. Business prior to the Closing, as
otherwise set forth herein, or as is otherwise approved in writing by U.S.
Seller, (c) neither Purchasers nor the Company shall have any rights in, and
shall not after the 90th day after the Closing Date use, any Seller Name,
except as specifically provided above, (d) neither Purchasers nor the Company
shall contest the ownership or validity of any rights of Sellers or any Non-
Purchased Affiliate in or to the Seller Names, and (e) Sellers shall have no
responsibility for claims by third parties arising out of or relating to, the
use by 

  

    ##### 

  

   

U.S. Purchaser, U.K. Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof of any Seller Names
after the Closing Date, and Purchasers agree, jointly and severally, to
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and the Non-Purchased Affiliates from any
and all liability that may arise out of the use thereof by Purchasers or any
Affiliate (including the Company) thereof. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing shall prevent Purchasers from
using the name and mark "HRT" as all or part of a tradename or trade mark or
otherwise in connection with the Global Business and (ii) maintenance or use
of historical records of the Global Business shall not be a violation of this
Section 10.2. 

   

10.3. _Covenant Not to Compete_. 

  

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers shall not, and shall cause all
Non-Purchased Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly conduct or engage in
the business of designing, manufacturing or selling products or services
competitive with those products or services manufactured, produced
or supplied by the Global Business as of the Closing as set forth on
_Schedule 1_ (the "Restricted Business") anywhere in the world. 

  

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller nor any
of their existing respective Affiliates or any future respective Affiliates,
shall be in violation of this Section 10.3(a) (A) if it continues to operate
its existing businesses other than Company, (B) as a result of the operation
of the Combat Vehicles business of Cadillac Gage Textron Inc. and any related
operations of U.S. Seller through its Textron Marine and Land Systems
Division, including, but not limited to, the purchase and sale of products
within the Restricted Business for vehicles manufactured by Cadillac Gage
Textron Inc. or U.S. Sellers Textron Marine and Land Systems Division, as
operated as of the date hereof, (C) if it acquires all or substantially all
the assets of any person which derive 10% or less of such persons gross
revenues from a Restricted Business, or (D) if it owns or acquires less than
10% of the record or beneficial interest of the equity securities of any
entity that is engaged in the Restricted Business; provided, that it shall not
be deemed a breach of this Section 10.3(a) if U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates (existing or future) acquires more than
the 10% record or beneficial interest threshold in any entity whose gross
revenues derived from the Restricted Business constitute less than 20% of the
consolidated gross revenues of such entity for the most recently completed
fiscal year. In the event U.S. Seller, U.K. Seller or any Affiliate of U.S.
Seller or U.K. Seller exceeds the thresholds set forth above, it shall not be
deemed a breach of this Section 10.3(a) if U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller or any
such Affiliate thereof promptly divests or discontinues, as the case may
be (in any event within twelve (12) months from the date it exceeds the 10%
ownership or 20% revenue threshold), that portion of its investment over the
10% ownership threshold or that portion of the Restricted Business which
exceeds the 20% consolidated revenue limit of such entity. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a)(i), if Sellers or any of their existing
Affiliates or any future Affiliates acquires 90% or more of the record or
beneficial ownership interest in any entity (the "Acquired Entity") whose
revenues derived from the Restricted Business constitute 20% or more of the
consolidated gross revenues of the Acquired Entity for the most recently
completed fiscal year prior to the date of such acquisition ("Sellers
Acquisition"), Sellers shall promptly after the date of Sellers Acquisition
grant Purchasers an option to acquire the portion of such entity engaged in
the Restricted Business (the "Restricted Portion") as provided in this
Section 10.3(a)(ii). Such option may be exercised by Purchasers at any time
during the sixth (6th) month after the date of Sellers Acquisition by
written notice to Sellers of such exercise; thereafter, such option shall
lapse and be of no further force or effect. The exercise price for such
option shall be an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price, including
liabilities assumed, paid by Sellers or their Affiliate for its interest in
the Acquired Entity multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the net operating profit or other mutually acceptable measure of value of the
Restricted Portion during the most recently completed fiscal year prior to
the date of Sellers Acquisition and the denominator of which shall be the
net operating profit or other mutually acceptable measure of value of the
Acquired Entity during the same period. The purchase by Purchasers of the
Restricted Portion would be subject to the execution by Sellers or their
Affiliate and Purchasers of a mutually satisfactory definitive agreement for
such purchase and the obtaining of all necessary governmental approvals and
material third party consents (in each case at no out of pocket cost
or expense to Sellers), and to the expiration or termination of all
applicable waiting periods (including any extensions thereof) required under
the HSR Act, without the threat or initiation of legal action by the FTC or
the Antitrust Division. Sellers representations in the definitive purchaser
and sale agreement concerning the Restricted Portion would be limited to
reasonable assurances that Sellers had caused the Restricted Portion to be
operated in the ordinary course of business during the period of Sellers
ownership. The definitive purchase and sale agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby could be terminated at the option of either Sellers or
their respective Affiliate, on the one hand, or Purchasers, on the other if
such transactions were not consummated by the end of the third (3rd) month
following the exercise of Sellers option therefor. If Purchasers do not
exercise the option described in this Section 10.3(a)(ii) or if the sale of
the Restricted Portion contemplated hereby is not consummated other than
because of Sellers default, Sellers may retain ownership of the Acquired
Entity, including the Restricted Portion, without further obligation to
Purchasers hereunder. 

  

(b) If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines that any term or provision contained in Section 10.3(a) is invalid
or unenforceable, then the court or tribunal shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term
or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. 

  

10.4. _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing, without
further consideration, the parties shall cooperate with each other and shall
execute and deliver instruments of transfer or assignment, or such other
documents to the other party as such other party reasonably may request to
evidence or perfect U.S. Purchasers right, title and interest to the Shares,
and U.K. Purchasers right, title and interest to the Purchased Assets and
otherwise carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers shall promptly after the
Closing cooperate with Company to transfer to Company title to any
intellectual property listed or required to be listed on _Schedule 4.13_ and
the title to which is held by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers other than
Company. Purchasers shall cause Company and its officers, employees,
consultants, agents, accountants and attorneys to reasonably cooperate with
Sellers in connection with Termination Claims retained by U.S. Seller.
Sellers shall pay, and shall reimburse Purchasers or Company, as the case may
be, for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including third
party claims) incurred in connection with such claims. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

10.5. _Additional Covenants_. The parties agree to be bound by the additional
covenants as set forth on _Schedule 10.5_. 

   

10.6. _Accounts Receivable_  

  

(a) U.K. Seller will hold any payments which it receives in respect of the
Accounts Receivable in trust for U.K. Purchaser and will account for any such
payments received and pay the same over to the U.K. Purchaser on a monthly
basis without any deduction or set off. 

  

(b) U.K. Seller shall after the Closing provide all reasonable assistance to
U.K. Purchaser in order to notify (in terms to be agreed) all persons from
whom the Accounts Receivable are owing, instructing such persons to account
in respect of the Accounts Receivable to the U.K. Purchaser or as it may
direct. 

  

(c) U.K. Seller shall promptly forward to U.K. Purchaser all correspondence or
other communications received by U.K. Seller in connection with the Accounts
Receivable. 

  

10.7. _Real Property Covenant_. Until eighteen months after the Closing Date,
U.S. Purchaser shall not obtain a survey with respect to the Owned Real
Property, other than in connection with any of the following: 

   

(a) as required pursuant to any Law or Order; 

  

(b) in connection with any dispute, claim, suit, action or other proceeding
involving the rights of U.S. Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to the
Owned Real Property; 

   

(c) in connection with any sale of the Company or the Owned Real Property; 

  

(d) in connection with the erection, repair or improvement of any structure or
other improvement on the Owned Real Property; 

   

(e) in connection with any financing pursued by U.S. Seller; or 

  

(f) in connection with any environmental or remediation matter pursued by U.S.
Seller or any of its Affiliates. 

  

10.8. _Government Investigation_. Following the Closing, U.S. Purchaser shall
cause Company to use its best efforts to assist Sellers in investigating the
facts underlying, and supporting the defense of, any claim brought by any
Governmental Body arising out of any fact or event that constitutes a breach
of any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.24 and for which
U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller (or both) is obligated to indemnify U.S. Purchaser
or its Affiliates. Sellers shall pay, and shall reimburse U.S. Purchaser or
its Affiliates, as the case may be, for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including third party claims) incurred in connection with such
assistance. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

10.9. _Product Liability Insurance_. After the Closing Date, U.S. Seller will
(a) promptly upon written request provide copies of the Aviation Policies not
previously provided, applications, and related underwriting submissions to
the extent reasonably available to the Company, the U.K. Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates, (b) reasonably cooperate with and assist the Company,
the U.K. Purchaser and their respective Affiliates in providing notice
of claims, providing information necessary to perfect, preserve or prosecute
claims under the Aviation Policies, and (c) not hinder or oppose the Company
or the U.K. Purchaser from seeking recovery under any Aviation Policy for any
claim for coverage. 

  

 _ARTICLE XI_ 
  _Notices_

 _ARTICLE XIV_ 
  _Indemnification_  

   

14.1. _Indemnification by Sellers_. Subject to the restrictions and
limitations otherwise set forth in this Article XIV, including Sections 14.4
and 14.5, Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold Purchasers
and their respective Affiliates harmless against and in respect of any
Damages incurred or sustained by Purchasers or their respective Affiliates:
(a) resulting from any breach of or inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Sellers set forth in Article IV; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any claim for indemnification under this subsection (a) must be made in
writing and state the basis for such claim no later than the expiration of
the applicable survival period specified in Section 16.13; (b) resulting from
any breach by U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller of its covenants or agreements
contained herein (other than breaches of obligations contained in Article
XV); (c) with respect to Selling Expenses; (d) resulting from noncompliance
by U.S. Sellers Pension Plans with the provisions of the Code or ERISA,
including any regulations thereunder, or any adverse determination by the IRS,
DOL or PBGC with respect to U.S. Sellers Pension Plans; (e) resulting from
the failure of the trustee for U.S. Sellers Pension Plans to make the
transfer described in Section 9.3; (f) resulting from any claim against
Company or its Affiliates of the type described in Section 10.5; (g) resulting
from Sellers failure to perform or comply with any of Sellers obligations
under Article XV; (h) with respect to Retained Liabilities; (i) subject to
Section 9.13(a)(v) resulting from a claim made by a U.K. Employee for a right
to benefit arising by reason of transfer under TUPE or the Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 where the U.K.
Employees rights prior to that transfer were to benefits under an
occupational pension scheme other than on old age, disability, or death; (j)
resulting from any claim for indemnification asserted against the
Company pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of April 7, 2004
by and between the Company and Energy-Williams Acquisition Corp., and (k)
resulting from any claim for indemnification asserted against the Company
pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of February 5, 2009 by

(including this indemnification) is intended to alter, amend, modify or
reduce, and does not alter, amend, modify or reduce the Companys post-
closing obligations as set fort in such Purchase and Sale Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, and subject to Section 14.3(g) and _Schedule
14.1_, "Damages" shall mean damages, losses, costs, expenses (including
reasonable legal, accounting and other fees and expenses of professional
advisers), charges, settlements, judgments, liabilities or
obligations imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by or asserted
against an indemnified party under this Article XIV, subject to _Schedule
14.1_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

14.2. _Indemnification by Purchasers_. Subject to the restrictions and
limitations otherwise set forth in this Article XIV, Purchasers shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify and hold Sellers and their respective

liabilities for post-retirement welfare benefits, as provided in Section 9.5;
(b) all obligations and liabilities in connection with workers compensation
claims filed against Company, as provided in Section 9.6; (c) any Damages
incurred or sustained by Sellers or their Affiliates resulting from any
breach by Purchasers of their covenants or agreements contained
herein, including Damages resulting from Purchasers or Companys failure to
pay Taxes pursuant to Section 15.3 or failure to perform or comply with any
of Purchasers or Companys obligations under Article XV; (d) any Damages
incurred or sustained by Sellers or their Affiliates directly resulting
from Companys use of the "Textron" name after the Closing; (e) resulting
from any claim against Sellers or their Affiliates of the type described in

Safety Requirements by Sellers or their Affiliates with regard to the Company

indemnification from Sellers under Sections 8.1, 8.2 or 14.1 of this
Agreement; (g) matters arising out of, or based upon, or in any way connected
with (whether such connection be proximate or remote, foreseeable or
unforeseeable as of the Closing Date), in whole or in part, the failure
of Purchasers or Company to perform their obligations under the Government
Contracts; and (h) any Damages incurred or sustained by Sellers or their
Affiliates resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations
and warranties of Purchasers contained in Article V;  _provided_ , _however_
, that any claim for indemnification under this subsection (h) must be made
in writing and state the basis for such claim no later than eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date; and (i) the U.K. Purchasers failure to pay,
perform or discharge the Assumed Liabilities as and when due. In no event
shall Purchasers liability for indemnification under this Section 14.2
exceed the Purchase Price. 

   

14.3. _Indemnification Procedures and Other Indemnification Matters_. 

   

(a) Third Party Claims. 

  

(i) Claim Notice. Promptly after receipt by a person or entity entitled to
indemnification under Article XIV (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the
assertion of a third-party claim, proceeding, suit or other action (other
than those involving Taxes, which are addressed in Article XV) (each a
"Claim") against it, the Indemnified Party will, if it desires to make a claim
against a person or entity obligated to indemnify it under Article XIV (an
"Indemnifying Party"), give notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying
Party of the assertion of such Claim. An Indemnified Partys failure to
promptly provide an Indemnifying Party with a Claim Notice will
relieve Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim only if and to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced in its ability to defend such
action as a result of such failure. Section 16.8 will not apply to
Sections 14.3(a)(i)-(iii). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(ii) Response to Claim Notice. Within 30 days after the Indemnifying Party
receives a Claim Notice (such 30 day period, the "Response Period"), the
Indemnifying Party will deliver a written notice (a " Claim Response") to the
Indemnified Party in which the Indemnifying Party indicates whether it will
(1) assume the sole defense of the Claim (an "Assumption Notice"), (2) assume
the defense of the Claim subject to a Reservation Notice or its right to
deliver a Reservation Notice pursuant to Section 14.3(a)(ii)(C), or (3)
decline to assume the defense of the Claim. If the Indemnified Party does not
receive such a written notice within the Response Period, then the
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have declined to assume defense of the
Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
will not prevent the Indemnifying Party from subsequently delivering an
Assumption Notice or a Reservation Notice at any time pursuant to this
Section 14.3(a). 

  

A. Indemnifying Party Assumes Defense. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a
Claim Response containing an Assumption Notice, or thereafter assumes the
sole defense of Reserved Claim pursuant to the first sentence of Section
14.3(a)(ii), then (1) such Claim will be deemed to be an indemnifiable claim
under Article XIV, (2) the Indemnifying Party will assume all liability
related to such Claim, except as set forth in Section 14.3(a)(ii)(E), (3) the
Indemnified Party will be relieved of all liability related to such Claim,
except as set forth in Section 14.3(a)(ii)(E), (4) the Indemnifying Party may
assume the sole defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party, and may compromise or settle such claim as it deems
appropriate, and (5) the Indemnifying Party forever waives the right to
assert a defense to any indemnification claim under Article XIV with respect
to the Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no compromise or settlement of
such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), if: (1) there is any finding or admission of any violation of
Law or any violation of rights of any person or any effect on any other claim
that may be made against the Indemnified Party; or (2) any relief provided is
other than monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in connection with such Claim, the
Indemnified Party determines that there is a reasonable probability that: (1)
there will be a finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation
of rights of any person, or there is any effect on any other claim that may
be made against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party may, by
notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the right to co-defend, compromise
and settle such Claim and the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any
determination of such Claim so defended or any compromise or settlement so
effected without its consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); or (2) any relief provided will be other than
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the right
to co-defend, compromise and settle such Claim and, with respect to non-
monetary damages, take the lead in defending, compromising and settling such
Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any
determination of such Claim so defended or any compromise or settlement so
effected without its consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). 

  

B. Indemnifying Party Declines to Assume Defense. If the Indemnifying Party
sends a Response in which it declines to assume defense of the Claim or if it
fails to deliver a Claim Response within the Response Period, then the
Indemnified Party may assume the sole defense of such Claim, and unless the
Indemnified Party first receives an Assumption Notice, may compromise or
settle such claim as it deems appropriate, and assert an indemnity claim
against the Indemnifying Party for Damages arising from or related to such
Claim pursuant to this Article XIV, and the Indemnifying Party will be bound
by any determination made in such Claim or any compromise or
settlement effected by the Indemnified Party if it is determined that the
Indemnifying Party is liable therefor. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

C. Indemnifying Party Assumes Defense Subject to Reservation of Rights.
Following its receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may send a
written notice to the Indemnified Party (a "Reservation Notice") pursuant to
which it (A) elects to defend a Claim (a "Reserved Claim") subject to a
reservation of rights and (B) states, in good faith, the reasons known (if
any) to the Indemnifying Party that the Reserved Claim may not be subject to
indemnification pursuant to Article XIV; _provided_ , _however_ , that: 

  

1. such Reservation Notice must be received by the Indemnified Party within 150 days after the date on which the Indemnifying Party received the Claim Notice for such Reserved Claim; 

  

2. if the Indemnifying Party has delivered an Assumption Notice, it may not send a Reservation Notice; 

  

3. in defending the Reserved Claim, the Indemnifying Party may retain only the litigation counsel it typically retains to represent it in claims of a similar nature as the Reserved Claim or a counsel which has a similar or lower, blended hourly rate; 

  

4. the Indemnified Party may, at any time, elect to co-defend such Reserved Claim (with the Indemnifying Party serving as lead counsel), but may retain only the litigation counsel it typically retains to represent it in claims of a similar nature as the Reserved Claim or a counsel which has a similar or lower, blended hourly rate; 

  

5. at the election of either party, the parties will enter into a joint defense agreement in customary form; and 

  

6. if, at any time thereafter, the Indemnifying Party becomes aware of any facts or information, or if there are any events or circumstances, that would make it substantially more likely that a Reserved Claim is not indemnifiable pursuant to Article XIV, then the Indemnifying Party will promptly provide the Indemnified Party with a written notice describing such facts, information, events or circumstances in reasonable detail (a "New Information Notice"). 

  

D. Assumption of Sole Defense. At any time after the delivery of a Reservation
Notice, the Indemnifying Party may assume the sole defense of a Reserved
Claim by delivering to the Indemnified Party a notice to that effect,
whereupon Section 14.3(a)(ii)(A) will apply. At any time, the Indemnified
Party may assume the sole defense of a Reserved Claim, but if it does so it
will be prohibited from seeking indemnification under Article XIV with
respect to such Reserved Claim. 

  

E. Defense After Receipt of New Information Notice. Within 30 days after the
Indemnified Party receives a New Information Notice, the Indemnified Party
must deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice in which the
Indemnified Party indicates whether it will (A) assume the sole defense of
the Reserved Claim (a "New Information Assumption Notice"), or (B) decline to
assume the sole defense of the Reserved Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does
not receive such a written notice within such 30 day period, then the
Indemnified Party will be deemed to have declined to assume the sole defense
of the Reserved Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence. If the Indemnified
Party delivers a New Information Assumption Notice, then it will be prohibited
from seeking indemnification under Article XIV with respect to such Reserved
Claim. If the Indemnified Party declines to assume the sole defense of the
Reserved Claim, then the delivery of the New Information Notice will have no
effect on the rights and obligations of the Indemnifying Party
and Indemnified Party under this Section 14.3(a). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(iii) Legal Fees, Costs and Expenses. "Defense Costs" means all reasonable
legal fees, expenses, filing fees, costs of investigation of a party related
to a Claim. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will each pay
their respective Defense Costs in connection with any Claim, except as
follows: 

  

(A) If the Indemnifying Party (1) declines, in its Response Notice, to assume
the defense of a claim, or fails to deliver a Response Notice within the
Response Period, or (2) delivers a Reservation Notice with respect to a Claim
and neither party subsequently elects to assume the sole defense of such
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will pay the amount of the Indemnified
Partys Defense Costs multiplied by the quotient of (x) the amount payable or
paid in settlement or awarded in a final, non-appealable judgment to the
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to any indemnity claim
asserted by the Indemnified Party under this Article XIV with respect to
such Claim, divided by (y) the amount payable or paid in settlement or
awarded in a final, non-appealable judgment by the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party or both to any third party with respect to such Claim; 

  

(B) If, at any time, the Indemnifying Party assumes the sole defense of a
Claim pursuant to Section 14.3(a)(iii), then, the Indemnifying Party will be
responsible for paying all Defense Costs of the Indemnified Party through the
date of such assumption; and 

  

(C) If the Indemnified Party does not deliver a New Information Assumption
Notice to the Indemnifying Party within 30 days after the Indemnified Party
receives a New Information Notice, then the Indemnified Party will pay the
amount of the Indemnifying Partys Defense Costs multiplied by the quotient
of (x) the amount payable or paid in settlement or awarded in a final, non-
appealable judgment to the Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnity claim asserted by the Indemnifying Party under this
Article XIV with respect to such Claim, divided by (y) the amount payable or
paid in settlement or awarded in a final, non-appealable judgment by the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party or both to any third party with
respect to such Claim. 

  

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party will pay all of
its own Defense Costs related to any Claim from the date on which a Claim is
asserted against it until the earlier of (1) 150 days after the date on which
the Indemnifying Party receives a Claim Notice for such Claim, and (2) the
date on which the Indemnified Party receives a Reservation Notice, if any. 

  

(b) The indemnities provided in this Agreement shall survive the Closing.
Except as set forth in Article VIII, Article XV and Section 16.14 and except
in the case of fraud, the indemnity provided in this Article XIV shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for damages of the Indemnified Party against the
Indemnifying Party at law or equity for any matter covered by this Agreement
following the Closing (but without prejudice to any remedies available under
the Related Documents with respect to the transactions contemplated
thereunder). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) If the amount with respect to which any claim is made under any of
Sections 14.1 or 14.2 of this Agreement (an "Indemnity Claim") gives rise to
a currently realizable Tax Benefit to the party making the claim, the
indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Benefit available
to the party making the claim. To the extent such Indemnity Claim does not
give rise to a currently realizable Tax Benefit, if the amount with respect
to which any Indemnity Claim is made gives rise to a subsequently realized
Tax Benefit to the party that made the claim, such party shall refund to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax Benefit when, as and if
realized. For the purposes of this Agreement, any subsequently realized Tax
Benefit shall be treated as though it were a reduction in the amount of the
initial Indemnity Claim, and the liabilities of the parties shall be
redetermined as though both occurred at or prior to the time of the
indemnity payment. For purposes of this Section 14.3(c), a "Tax Benefit"
means an amount by which the Tax liability of the party (or group of
corporations including the party) is reduced (including, by deduction,
reduction of income by virtue of increased Tax basis or otherwise, entitlement
to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the
relevant Taxing authority. Where a party has other losses, deductions,
credits or items available to it, the Tax Benefit from any losses,
deductions, credits or items relating to the Indemnity Claims shall be deemed
to be realized only after the utilization of such other losses, deductions,
credits or items. For the purposes of this Section 14.3(c), a Tax Benefit is
"currently realizable" to the extent it can be reasonably anticipated that
such Tax Benefit shall be realized in the current Taxable period or year or
in any Tax Return with respect thereto (including through a carryback to a
prior Taxable period) or in any Taxable period or year prior to the date of
the Indemnity Claim. In the event that there should be a determination
disallowing the Tax Benefit, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable to refund
to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related reduction previously
allowed or payments previously made to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Section 14.3(c). The amount of the refunded reduction or payment shall
be deemed a payment under Sections 14.1 and 14.2 of this Agreement and thus
shall be paid subject to any applicable reductions under this Section
14.3(c). The parties agree that the Indemnified Party will provide to the
Indemnifying Party, as part of any Indemnity Claim, an explanation and
documentation of when a Tax Benefit is realized or anticipated to be
realized. 

  

(d) The parties agree that any indemnification payments made, and/or any
payments (or adjustments) made with respect to a Tax Benefit, pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable law, in which event
payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the party on a
net after-Tax basis. 

  

(e) Each party and their Affiliates shall be obligated in connection with any
claim for indemnification under this Article XIV to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds available to such
indemnitee with regard to the applicable claims (including the amount of any
indemnification, contribution or other similar payment paid to the Indemnified
Party with respect to applicable Damages). The amount which the Indemnifying
Party is or may be required to pay to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article XIV shall be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance
proceeds or other amounts actually recovered by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Party in reduction of the related Damages (including the amount
of any indemnification, contribution or other similar payment paid to the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages). If an Indemnified Party
shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from an
Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages and shall subsequently receive
insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Damages, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal
to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually
received. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) Any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this
Article XIV shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall either
party be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for the
same Damages. 

  

(g) No Indemnifying Party shall be required to make any payment hereunder in
respect of any Damages which are contingent until the time that such
contingent Damages cease to be contingent. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 14.3(g) affects only the parties payment obligation hereunder, not
the parties indemnification rights or obligations hereunder, and an
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to indemnify an Indemnified Party for
expenses actually incurred with respect to any claim that is subject to
indemnity under this Article XIV (and subject to the limits contained
herein), notwithstanding the fact that such underlying claim may be
contingent. 

  

(h) To the extent that Sellers make any payment pursuant to this Article XIV
in respect of Damages for which Purchasers or any of their respective
Affiliates have a right to recover against an insurance company, Sellers
shall to the extent permitted by Law and Purchasers insurance policies, be
subrogated to the right of Purchasers or any of their Affiliates to seek
recovery from such insurer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Sellers shall be
prohibited from such subrogation, Purchasers or their respective Affiliates
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery from such insurer
on Sellers behalf and pay any such recovery to Sellers after allowing for
(i) Tax on such payment, and (ii) the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
claiming for the payment. 

  

(i) If Purchasers, or either of U.S. Purchaser or U.K. Purchaser, shall make a
claim for Schedule 14.1 Damages, to the extent that (i) Sellers make any
payment on account of Schedule 14.1 Damages pursuant to this Article XIV and
(ii) U.S. Purchaser or U.K. Purchaser has a right to recover against a third
party (other than an insurance company, as to which subsection (h) above will
apply) on account of the claim underlying such Schedule 14.1 Damages, then
Sellers shall, to the extent permitted by Law, be subrogated to the right of
such Purchaser to seek and obtain recovery from such third party; provided,
however, that if Sellers shall be prohibited from such subrogation,
Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery from
such third party on Sellers behalf and pay any such recovery to Sellers
after allowing for (i) Tax on such payment, and (ii) the out-of-pocket costs
and expenses of claiming for the payment. 

  

(j) Each Indemnified Party shall be obligated in connection with any claim for
indemnification under this Article XIV to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to such Damages. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Sellers
nor any of their Affiliates shall be liable to Purchasers or any of their
Affiliates, including Company, nor shall Purchasers or any of their
Affiliates be liable to Sellers or any of their Affiliates, pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, any of the agreements contemplated hereby,
or otherwise, for any special, punitive or incidental damages or loss of
goodwill; and Purchasers and Sellers each hereby waive their right and that
of its respective Affiliates to assert any such damages with respect to any
claim, action, charge, suit or proceeding arising out of or in connection
with the any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(l) Notwithstanding anything in Article XIV to the contrary, Sellers shall not
be liable for any Damages pursuant to Section 14.1 arising out of any matter
to the extent that the Damages with respect to such matter have been
reflected in the Closing Statement of Working Capital or an adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5(e). 

  

(m) If the Purchasers provide a Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 1.5(b) with
respect to any fact or matter, and the Accounting Arbitrator makes a final,
written determination pursuant to Section 1.5(b) with respect to such fact or
matter, then the Purchasers may not seek indemnification under Section
14.1(a) arising from a breach of the representations and warranties in
Section 4.6 or 4.19(a)(i) relating to such fact or matter. 

  

14.4. _Limitations of Liability_. The obligations and liabilities of Sellers
under Section 14.1 hereof shall be subject to the following additional
limitations: 

  

(a) Subject to Sections 14.5(a) and 14.5(b) and other than with respect to
Damages incurred or sustained by Purchasers or their respective Affiliates
resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in Sellers representations and
warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of this Agreement (the "Seller
Fundamental Representations"), Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify
Purchasers or their respective Affiliates (i) pursuant to Section 14.1(a) for
any Damages or (ii) pursuant to Section 14.1 for any Damages arising out of
Sellers or Companys failure to pay non-Income Taxes of the Global Business
or failure to perform or comply with any of the Sellers other
obligations under Article XV hereof relating to non-Income Taxes of the
Global Business: (i) with respect to any claim resulting from any breach of
or inaccuracy in Sellers representations and warranties (other that the
Seller Fundamental Representations) that individually (or in the aggregate
with respect to related claims) does not exceed $25,000 (the "Claim Threshold
Amount"), (ii) until such time as the aggregate amount of Damages to
Purchasers or their Affiliates for which Purchasers or their Affiliates would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 14.1
exceeds $3,000,000 (the "Global Deductible") and thereafter, only to the
extent of such aggregate Damages in excess of the Global Deductible,
provided, however, that claims that do not meet the Claim Threshold Amount
shall not be applied against or towards the Global Deductible or (iii) in
an aggregate amount (including amounts paid (A) pursuant to Section 14.5(b)
and (B) on account of Schedule 14.1 Damages) in excess of $54,750,000 (the
"Global Cap"). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Other than with respect to Damages arising from fraud, Sellers aggregate
liability for indemnification pursuant to Sections 14.1(a), 14.1(b), 14.1(d)
and 14.1(e) and arising out of Sellers or Companys failure to pay non-
Income Taxes of the Global Business or failure to perform or comply with any
of the Sellers other obligations under Article XV hereof relating to non-
Income Taxes of the Global Business shall not exceed the Purchase Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the preceding sentence nor anything
else in this Agreement shall limit the Sellers indemnification obligations
arising pursuant to Sections 14.1(c), 14.1(f), 14.1(g) (other than those
arising out of Sellers or Companys failure to pay non-Income Taxes of the
Global Business or failure to perform or comply with any of the Sellers
other obligations under Article XV hereof relating to non-Income Taxes of the
Global Business), 14.1(h), 14.1(i), 14.1(j) or 14.1(k). 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 10.7, if, within 18 months
after the Closing Date, the U.S. Purchaser obtains a survey of the Owned Real
Property in connection with (i) the sale of the Owned Real Property other
than in connection with the sale of the Company or (ii) the erection, repair
or improvement of any structure or other improvement on the Owned Real
Property, then the Purchaser may not thereafter assert a claim under Section
14.1(a) arising from a breach of the representations and warranties contained
in Section 4.7(a) on the basis of any Encumbrance against the Real Property
or other state of facts disclosed pursuant to such a survey. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 14, if
U.S. Seller or any of its Affiliates assert a claim, action, suit or
proceeding against the Company or the U.K. Purchaser, other than claims,
actions, suits or proceedings related to matters or items reflected, reserved
against or disclosed on the Reference Balance Sheet or incurred in the
ordinary course of business between the date of the Reference Balance Sheet
and the Closing Date (an "Intercompany Claim"), then (i) neither Purchaser
may assert a claim for indemnification pursuant to Article 14.1 with respect
to any such Intercompany Claim until Damages with respect to such claim
exceeds $100,000, (ii) the Claim Threshold Amount will not apply to any such
claim, and (c) the Global Deductible will not apply to any such claim. 

   

14.5. _General Limitations on Liability_. 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event the
Purchasers terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 16.11(c)(ii) on
account of or due to a breach of a representation or warranty arising from
(i) a Pre-Existing Matter disclosed on a Schedule Update, the Sellers
aggregate liability to the Purchasers or their Affiliates for any claim
arising from a Pre-Existing Matter disclosed on a Schedule Update shall be
limited to the Purchasers and their Affiliates actual out-of-pocket costs
in connection with or related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that were incurred on or after the date hereof (but on or before
the date of such termination), and (ii) a New Matter disclosed on a Schedule
Update, Sellers shall have no obligation whatsoever to indemnify Purchasers
or their Affiliates under this Agreement. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event the Closing
occurs, (i) Sellers aggregate liability for indemnification for breaches of
their representations and warranties (other than Seller Fundamental
Representations) arising from a Pre-Existing Matter disclosed on a Schedule
Update shall be limited to $36,500,000, (ii) all Schedules referred to in
Article IV to which a Schedule Update was made will be deemed to be updated
with respect to all New Matters for purposes of this Agreement and (iii)
Sellers shall have no liability whatsoever for indemnification for breaches
of any of their representations or warranties (other than Seller Fundamental
Representations) arising from a New Matter disclosed on a Schedule Update. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

 _ARTICLE XV_ 
  _Tax Matters_  

   

15.1. _Tax Sharing_. On the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements and
arrangements between Company, on the one hand, and U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller
or any Affiliates of U.S. Seller or U.K. Seller other than Company, on the
other (copies of which have been attached to _Schedule 15.1_ ), shall be
terminated, all liabilities shall be extinguished or deemed satisfied and
no additional payments shall be made thereunder. 

   

15.2. _Payments: Sellers  Responsibility_. 

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including in Sections
15.11 and 15.12 of this Agreement, Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid
(without duplication of amounts otherwise payable, including amounts set
forth as a current liability in the Closing Statement of Working Capital, and
excluding any interest, penalties and additions to Tax arising solely from any
act or omission after the Closing Date by Purchasers or Company if such act
or omission was not caused by an act or omission of Sellers or any Affiliate
of Sellers other than Company) the following Taxes attributable to periods
ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion of any period up to the
Closing Date that includes (but does not end on) such day ("Pre-Closing Tax
Periods"): (i) all federal Income Taxes payable with respect to which Company
has filed or is required to file a federal Income Tax Return whether
separately or as part of a consolidated federal Income Tax Return, (ii) all
state, local and foreign Income Taxes with respect to which Company has filed
or is required to file a state, local or foreign Income Tax Return whether
separately or as part of a combined, consolidated, unitary or similar Return
payable with respect to Company, (iii) all Taxes other than Income Taxes for
which Company may be held liable, and (iv) all Taxes of any person for which
Company may be held liable pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6(a) (or any comparable or similar provision of Law) as a transferee,
pursuant to any contractual obligation, or otherwise. 

  

(b) With respect to Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods that do not
end on the Closing Date, the amount of Taxes of Company attributable to the
portion of such period up to the Closing Date shall be determined as follows:
(i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g. property Taxes),
the amount of such Taxes incurred during the entire taxable period
that includes the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in such period up to the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such period;
and (ii) in the case of other Taxes, the amount of such Taxes shall be
computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date. The obligation of Sellers in respect of the Taxes described in
clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be effected by the payment to Purchasers of
the excess of (A) the amount of such Taxes attributable to the portion of the
period up to the Closing Date over (B) the sum of (x) the amount of such
Taxes paid by Sellers or Company on or prior to the Closing Date and (y) the
cumulative reserve and/or liabilities for such Taxes on the Closing Statement
of Working Capital. If the sum set forth in clause (B) in the immediately
preceding sentence exceeds the amount of Taxes described in clause (A) of
such sentence, Purchasers shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

15.3. _Payments: Purchasers  Responsibility_. Purchasers shall pay or cause
to be paid all Taxes payable with respect to Company that are not described
as being the responsibility of Sellers in Section 15.2. 

  

15.4. _Returns: Sellers  Responsibility_. Sellers and Purchasers shall cause
Company, to the extent permitted by law to join, for all taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in (a) the consolidated federal
Income Tax Returns of Sellers Group and (b) the combined, consolidated,
unitary or similar Returns for state, local and foreign Income Taxes with
respect to which Company (i) filed such a Return for the most recent taxable
period for which a Return has been filed prior to the Closing Date and may
file such a Return for subsequent taxable periods or (ii) is required to file
such a Return by the applicable taxing authority. Except as provided
in Sections 15.2(b) and 15.5, the income, deductions and credits of Company
for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be included in the
consolidated federal Income Tax Returns of Sellers Group and in such
combined, consolidated, unitary or similar Returns where applicable. Sellers
shall file, or cause to be filed, all other Returns including any separate
Income Tax Returns, relating to the business or assets of Company required to
be filed on or before the Closing Date. All Returns described in this Section
15.4 shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior
taxable periods unless otherwise required by Law. Sellers may, in their sole
and absolute discretion, amend any Tax Return referred to in (a) and (b)
above. 

  

15.5. _Returns: Purchasers  Responsibility_. Purchasers shall file, or cause
to be filed, all Returns relating to the business or assets of Company other
than those Returns described in Section 15.4 (including any federal Income
Tax Return filed by the consolidated group of which Purchasers are a member
with respect to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date).
The income, deductions and credits of Company, other than those required to
be included in the Returns described in Section 15.4, shall be included in
the Returns described in the immediately preceding sentence, including, (a)
items for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date with respect
to state, local and foreign Income Taxes that are not required to be included
in combined, consolidated, unitary or similar Returns or in Returns required
to be filed on or before the Closing Date pursuant to Section 15.4 and (b)
all items for periods after the Closing Date. Any such Returns for which
Purchasers are responsible shall, insofar as they relate to items for periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, be prepared on a basis consistent with
the last previous such Returns filed in respect of Company unless otherwise
required by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
15.5, Sellers and Purchasers agree that, where permitted by law, they shall
treat (or elect to treat) the Closing Date as the end of a Tax Period or, if
not so permitted, Sellers and Purchasers agree that the Closing Date shall be
deemed the end of the Tax Period. For purposes of Sections 15.2 and 15.5, the
amount of income attributable to the portion of 2009 that ends or is deemed
to end on the Closing Date and the portion after the Closing Date shall be
determined on the basis of a closing of the books of Company, the ratable
elections under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D)
and 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) or any similar state, local or foreign election,
shall not be made, and all transactions not in the ordinary course of
business occurring after the Closing shall be reported on the Tax Returns of
Purchasers or their Affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

15.6. _Cooperation_. Purchasers and Sellers shall cooperate, and Purchasers
shall cause Company to cooperate with Sellers, with respect to the
preparation and filing of any Return for which the other is responsible
pursuant to Sections 15.4 and 15.5 (including, providing work papers and
schedules); _provided_ , _however_ , that the party requesting assistance
shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the party providing such
assistance, and further, such assistance and cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the operations and business of the party
providing such assistance. Purchasers shall prepare or cause Company to
prepare, not later than ninety (90) days following the date of Closing and in
a manner consistent with the past practice of Company, the tax work paper
preparation package or packages necessary to enable Sellers to prepare
consolidated federal and combined, consolidated and unitary state and local
Income Tax Returns for the period or periods from January 4, 2009 through the
Closing Date. In connection therewith, Purchasers shall not dispose of any
Tax work papers, books or records relating to Company or with respect to any
assets of Company during the seven (7) year period following the Closing
Date, and thereafter shall give Sellers reasonable written notice before
disposing of such items. At Sellers request, Purchasers shall cause Company
to make and/or join with Sellers in making any Tax election after Closing
that involves a Tax Return which includes Company as part of any combined,
unitary, consolidated, affiliated or similar group that also includes Sellers
if the making of such election does not have an adverse impact on Purchasers
for any Tax period after the Closing Date. 

   

15.7. _Refunds_. 

  

(a) Sellers shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from
Purchasers or Company, and Purchasers shall cause Company to pay over to
Sellers any refund or credit with respect to Taxes (including, refunds and
credits arising by reason of amended Returns filed or a carryback filing
after the Closing Date) within five (5) days of receipt of such refund or
credit, plus any interest received with respect thereto from the applicable
taxing authorities, relating to Company that are described as being the
responsibility of Sellers in Section 15.2, other than refunds or credits of
Taxes that are identified as assets in determining Closing Net
Working Capital; provided that none of Sellers or their Affiliates other than
Company shall file an amended Return that would increase the Taxes that are
described as being the responsibility of Purchasers in Section 15.3 unless
required to do so by a taxing authority. Purchasers shall pay
Sellers interest at the rate prescribed under Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code,
compounded daily, on any amount not paid when due under this Section 15.7.
For purposes of this Section 15.7, where it is necessary to apportion any
such refund or credit between Purchasers and Sellers for the current taxable
period, such refund or credit shall be apportioned in the same manner that
Income Tax liabilities are apportioned under Section 15.5. 

  

(b) Purchasers shall cooperate, and shall cause Company to cooperate, with
Sellers, with respect to claiming any refund or credit with respect to Taxes
referred to in this Section 15.7 that Sellers reasonably believe should be
available. Such cooperation shall include preparing, signing and filing
appropriate forms with the applicable Tax authority, providing Sellers with
all relevant information available to Purchasers including copies of Returns
(through Company or otherwise, as the case may be), with respect to any such
claim; filing and diligently pursuing such claim (including by litigation, if
appropriate); paying over to Sellers in accordance with this provision, any
amount received by Purchasers (or Company), as the case may be, with respect
to such claim; and, in the case of Purchasers or Company filing such a
claim, consulting with Sellers prior to agreeing to any disposition of such
claim, provided that the foregoing shall be done at Sellers expense and in a
manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business
of the parties. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

15.8. _Audits and Contests_. 

  

(a) With respect to any issue that may affect the Taxes of U.K. Seller with
respect to the U.K. Business or Company for taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, each of U.S. Purchaser, U.K. Purchaser, U.S.
Seller and U.K. Seller shall promptly notify the other in writing within ten
(10) business days from its receipt of notice of (i) any pending Tax audits
or assessments of Company, and (ii) any pending Tax audits or assessments of
Purchasers or Sellers, or any of the Affiliates thereof. If either party
fails to give the other party prompt notice under this subsection, then if
such failure to give prompt notice results in a detriment to the party with
an indemnification obligation hereunder, then any amount which such party is
otherwise required to pay pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such
indemnification obligation, shall be reduced by the amount of such
detriment. 

  

(b) Sellers shall have the right to represent the interests of Company in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding to the extent relating to
Taxes that are described as being the responsibility of Sellers in Section
15.2, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, provided that
Sellers shall give prompt notice to Purchasers, keep Purchasers reasonably
informed and consult with Purchaser with respect to any issue relating to
such audit or proceeding that could have a material adverse effect on
Purchasers. Sellers may not enter into on behalf of Company or Purchasers a
settlement agreement with respect to any asserted Tax liability that has
a materially adverse effect on the Purchasers without the written consent of
Purchasers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Purchasers
shall have the right to represent the interests of Company in any Tax audit
or administrative or court proceeding not described in the immediately
preceding sentence and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense,
provided that Purchasers shall give prompt notice to Sellers, keep Sellers
reasonably informed and consult with Sellers with respect to any issue
relating to such audit or proceeding that could have a material adverse
effect on Sellers. Purchasers may not enter into on behalf of Company or
Sellers a settlement agreement with respect to any asserted Tax liability
that has a materially adverse effect on Sellers without the written consent
of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Purchasers and
Sellers shall cooperate, and Purchasers shall cause Company to cooperate with
Sellers, with respect to any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to Taxes referred to in this Section 15.8. Such cooperation shall
include providing all relevant information available to Sellers or Purchasers
(through Company or otherwise), as the case may be, with respect to any such
audit or proceeding and making personnel available at and for
reasonable times, including, to prepare responses to requests for
information, provided that the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not
to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the parties;
and provided further, that the party requesting said assistance shall pay
any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the party providing such
assistance. 

  

(c) The expenses of settlement, compromise or contest of such asserted Tax
liability shall be borne by the party that is ultimately determined to be
responsible for such Tax liability. In any event, each of U.S. Purchaser,
U.K. Purchaser, U.S. Seller, U.K. Seller, and Company may participate at its
own expense in the contest of such asserted Tax liability. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

15.9. _Post-Closing Actions which Affect Sellers  Liability for Taxes_. 

  

(a) If Purchasers (or an Affiliate of Purchasers, including Company) take any
action after the Closing, other than (i) actions that are in the ordinary
course of business and are consistent with past practices or (ii) required by
Law, then Purchasers shall indemnify Sellers for any resulting increase in
Sellers (or any of their Affiliates) liability for Taxes (including any
liability of Sellers to indemnify Purchasers for Taxes pursuant to this
Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, any increase in non-Income Taxes of
the Global Business for which either Seller is required to indemnify either
Purchaser that result from actions taken by Purchasers (or Affiliates
of Purchasers, including Company) described in (ii) of the preceding sentence
shall be subject to the applicable limitations of Section 14.4(a). Neither
U.S. Purchaser or U.K. Purchaser nor any Affiliate of U.S. Purchaser or U.K.
Purchaser (including the Company) shall take any action which would change
the character of any income or gain that Sellers or any of their Affiliates
must report on any Income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period; provided,
however, that Purchasers shall be permitted to make an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code. 

  

(b) Neither Purchasers nor any Affiliate of Purchasers (including Company)
shall amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return or make any carryback
filing relating in whole or in part to Company with respect to any taxable
year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or with respect to the
pre-Closing portion of the current taxable year) without the prior written
consent of Sellers, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of
Sellers. 

  

15.10. _Conduct of Business_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Purchasers shall be responsible for, and neither U.S. Seller nor
U.K. Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates other than Company shall
bear, any Taxes that arise due to the failure, following the Closing, of
Purchasers to cause Company to carry on its business on and after the Closing
Date only in the ordinary course and in substantially the same manner as
heretofore conducted. 

  

15.11. _Transaction Related Taxes_. Purchasers shall be responsible for the
timely payment of, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from and
against, all Taxes, including Transfer Taxes, that relate to the purchase and
sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement, other than Income Taxes of
Sellers Group resulting directly from such sale, which shall be borne by
Sellers except as set forth in Section 15.12 hereof. With respect to such Tax
Returns that are required to be filed prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall prepare and file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes and, with respect to all other such Tax
Returns, Purchasers shall prepare and file all necessary documentation and Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes; provided, however, that Sellers
shall cooperate with Purchasers and take any action reasonably requested by
Purchasers which does not cause Sellers to incur any cost or inconvenience in
order to minimize such Transfer Taxes. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

15.12. _Section 338 Election_. 

  

(a) The parties shall jointly make and file an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable provisions of state or local tax
law set forth on _Schedule 15.12(a)_ -(State Elections) with respect to the
purchase of the Shares and, at Closing, the parties shall execute a Form 8023
(or successor form), with all attachments, with respect to each such purchase
and Purchasers shall promptly file such form with the relevant tax authorities
and submit evidence of the filings to the Sellers. The parties shall
cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing such additional forms, returns, elections, schedules and
other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve each timely
election in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the
Treasury Department regulations (or any comparable provisions of state or
local tax law) or any successor provisions. In connection with each such
election, Purchasers and Sellers shall use their best efforts to prepare their
own Form 8883 and agree to the fair market value of each asset class on Form
8883 the ("Final Form 8883")(or successor form) on or before the Closing
Date, which shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with the
allocation of Purchase Price, plus any liabilities deemed assumed for Tax
purposes, among the assets of Company set forth on _Schedule 15.12(a)_ -(
_Allocation_ ). If Purchasers and Sellers are unable to agree on the Final
Form 8883 by the Closing Date, Purchasers shall prepare a draft Form 8883 (or
successor) and provide such draft Form 8883 to Sellers no later than sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date. If, within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of the draft Form 8883, Sellers notify Purchasers in writing that
Sellers disagree with the draft Form 8883, then the parties shall attempt in
good faith to resolve their disagreement within the twenty (20) days
following Sellers notification to Purchasers of such disagreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not dispute the draft Form 8883
if, and to the extent that, such draft Form 8883 is reasonably consistent
with the allocation set forth in the _Schedule 15.12(a)_-( _Allocation_ ).
If Sellers do not so notify Purchasers within thirty (30) days of receipt of
the draft Form 8883, or upon resolution of the disputed items by the parties,
the draft Form 8883 shall become the Final Form 8883\. If the parties are
unable to resolve their disagreement within the twenty (20) days following any
such notification by Sellers (the "Twenty Day Period"), the items remaining
in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to Mercer Capital (the
"Allocation Arbitrator"), who shall arbitrate any such dispute. The
Allocation Arbitrator shall determine the proper allocation of the
Purchase Price among the assets of Company for purposes of preparing the Form
8883\. Within thirty (30) days after his or her appointment, the Allocation
Arbitrator shall make a final written determination, which determination
shall be final and binding on the parties. The Form 8883 that is prepared
by each party in a manner consistent with the Allocation Arbitrators
determination shall become the Final Form 8883\. All fees and expenses of the
Tax Arbitrator in resolving the dispute shall be shared equally by Purchasers
and Sellers. The parties shall (i) be bound by each such Final Form 8883 for
purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file their Tax Returns on
a basis consistent with each such Final Form 8883, and (iii) take no position
inconsistent with each such Final Form 8883 on any applicable Tax Return or
in any proceeding before any Tax authority. In the event that any such Final
Form 8883 is disputed by any Tax authority, the party receiving notice
of such dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto of the
dispute. 

  

(b) Purchasers shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the Tax Detriment (as
hereinafter defined). "Tax Detriment" is the amount determined by Sellers in
a manner identical to the method described on _Schedule 15.12(b)_; provided,
however, that the Tax Detriment shall not exceed $12,000,000 nor be less than
$0. Sellers shall, and shall cause Company to, provide Purchasers with access
to all books, records, and other information (including, all information
relating to Sellers tax basis in the Share and Companys tax basis in its
assets) necessary to compute the Tax Detriment. If the Final Form 8883 is
prepared on or before the Closing Date, Purchasers shall pay to the Sellers
the Tax Detriment on the Closing Date. If the Final Form 8883 is not prepared
on or before the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall pay to the Sellers an
estimated Tax Detriment on the Closing Date 

  

    ##### 

  

   

as determined by the Sellers in good faith and reasonably consistent with the
allocation set forth in the _Schedule 15.12(a)_ -(Allocation) and the Tax
Detriment shall be finally determined by the Sellers when the Final Form 8883
is done, or the end of the Twenty Day Period. If the Tax Detriment as
finally determined exceeds the estimated Tax Detriment, Purchasers shall pay
to Sellers the excess of the Tax Detriment over the estimated Tax Detriment
within two (2) days of such final determination. If the estimated Tax
Detriment exceeds the Tax Detriment as finally determined, the Sellers shall
pay to Purchasers the excess of the estimated Tax Detriment over the Tax
Detriment to the Purchasers within two (2) days of such final determination.
If Purchasers fail to make full payment to Sellers of an amount equal to the
Tax Detriment on the Closing Date, in addition to such payment, Purchasers
shall pay to Sellers interest on the amount of such payment at the rate of six
percent (6%) per annum from the Closing Date through and including the date
of payment. The parties agree that the payment of the Tax Detriment shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price of the Shares. In addition,
Purchasers shall be liable for all state and local Company Taxes, other than
Income Taxes payable by the Sellers Group, resulting from the election under
Code Section 338(h)(10) (or any elections under analogous state and local law
provisions). 

  

(c) Sellers shall have no indemnification obligation under this Agreement to
Purchasers by reason of the election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (or any
elections under analogous state and local law provisions) being invalid or
ineffective for any reason.

Affiliates shall claim any Tax deductions arising by reason of the exercise
of options to acquire, or the vesting or award of, Sellers or their

at any time, including with respect to the exercise of stock options or
disposition of other equity-based compensation, if allowable under applicable
law. To the extent Sellers or their Affiliates are prohibited from claiming
such Tax deduction by applicable law and, at Sellers request, Purchasers are
able to claim such deduction, Purchasers shall pay to Sellers, within thirty
(30) days of claiming such deduction, the amount of any resulting Tax Benefit
less any out-of-pocket costs associated with claiming the deduction. 

  

15.16. _Survival of Article XV Covenants_. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the covenants contained in this Article XV shall
survive the Closing for the applicable statutes of limitations.

Purchasers, on the other hand, respectively. 

 

    #####

performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of
such party at a later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this
Agreement. No waiver of any condition or the breach of any term contained in
this Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be a, or construed

party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision give any third person
any right of subrogation or action over against any party to this

of or relating to this Agreement (other than controversies or claims for
which a dispute mechanism is specifically provided or controversies or claims

Purchasers shall first attempt in good faith to have the Controversy discussed

senior executives shall meet, along with a legal representative if desired,
at a mutually acceptable time and place, or by telephone, to exchange relevant
information and to discuss in good faith a resolution of the Controversy.
Neither party shall commence a legal action with respect to the Controversy
until the above-mentioned time periods have elapsed and the meeting of the
senior executives shall have taken place, except for legal actions seeking
immediate injunctive relief. 

  

16.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed as an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

16.10. _Headings: Table of Contents; Construction_. The headings of the
sections of this Agreement and the table of contents at the forepart of this

shall have issued an order, decree, writ or ruling or taken any other action
(which order, decree, writ, ruling or other action the parties hereto shall

respective reasonable efforts to vacate) in each case permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or materially restricting the
transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, writ, ruling or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable; (c) by Purchasers, if any
of Sellers (i) covenants and agreements have been breached so that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 are not reasonably likely to be satisfied
or (ii) representations and warranties have been breached so that
the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) are not reasonably
likely to be satisfied, in the case of (i) or (ii), if such breach cannot be
cured or has not been cured upon the earlier of (A) ten (10) days after the
giving of written notice from Purchasers to Sellers specifying such
breach and (B) the Outside Date; or (d) by Sellers, if any if Purchasers (i)
covenants and agreements have been breached so that the condition set forth
in Section 7.1 is not reasonably likely to be satisfied or (ii)
representations and warranties have been breached so that the condition set
forth in Section 7.2 is not reasonably likely to be satisfied, in the case of
(i) or (ii), if such breach cannot be cured or has not been cured upon the
earlier of (A) ten (10) days after the giving of written notice from Sellers
to Purchasers specifying such breach and (B) the Outside Date. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 16.11, all further
obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, provided that (i) the
obligations set forth in Article XIV and Sections 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4,
16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 16.9, 16.10, 16.11 and 16.15 shall survive and each
party shall retain any rights it may have against the other as a result of
the other partys breach or failure to comply with any other provision of
this Agreement prior to such termination and (ii) the obligations of the
parties set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect. 

  

16.12. _Meaning of Sellers  Knowledge_ For purposes of this Agreement the
phrase "to Sellers Knowledge" shall mean, and be limited to, the actual
knowledge of John R. Curran, Steven Beresford, Ray Scarcello, John Marshall,
Rick Bartz, Raj Barman, Arnold Friedman (with respect to facts and
disclosures related to intellectual property), Jamieson Schiff (with respect
to facts and disclosures related to environmental issues), Claudia Mojkowski
(with respect to facts and disclosures related to employee benefits) and
Patricia Gammage (with respect to facts and disclosures related to government
contracts), together with either (i) the actual knowledge each such person
shall have obtained from actual inquiry of such persons direct reports who
would reasonably be expected to have knowledge of the accuracy of the
applicable representations or warranty set forth in Article IV, or (ii) if no
such inquiry shall have been made, the actual knowledge such person would
have obtained had such inquiry been made.

16.14. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that the failure of either
party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder will cause
irreparable damage to the other party (the "Injured Party"), and that the
Injured Party would not have any adequate remedy at law in such event. It is
accordingly agreed that, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, an Injured Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other party (the "Injuring
Party"), and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in any Delaware Court, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which such Injured Party is entitled at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all expenses of
the Injured Party incurred in connection with any litigation brought by
such Injured Party relating to any injunction or injunctions or the right to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be paid
for by the Injuring Party in the event that the Injured Party is successful
in such litigation. Nothing contained in this Section 16.14 shall be deemed
or construed in any manner whatsoever as a waiver by an Injured Party of any
of the rights that it may have against the Injuring Party at law, equity, by
statute or otherwise arising out of, in connection with or resulting from the
breach by the Injuring Party of any of its covenants, agreements, duties or
obligations under this Agreement. 

  

16.15. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. The parties hereby irrevocably waive all right
to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based in
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or the actions of the parties or any of
their respective directors, officers or shareholders in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof. 

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed as of the day and year first above written.
