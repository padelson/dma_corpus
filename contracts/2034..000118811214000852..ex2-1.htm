Purchase Price Adjustments.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Estimated Working Capital Amount. The Company shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser not less than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date or such
other time as the Parties mutually agree: (i) an estimated balance sheet of
the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date prepared on the
same basis and using the same accounting methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures that were used in the preparation of the Audited
Financial Statements (the "Estimated Balance Sheet"); and (ii) a statement in
the form attached as Exhibit D (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting
forth the Company's calculation of the estimated Working Capital as of the
close of business on the Closing Date, each of which shall be prepared using
the methodology set forth on Exhibit B (it being understood that, except for
the non-GAAP principles and methodologies set forth on Exhibit B, the
Estimated Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP). Parent
shall review the foregoing and Parent and the Sellers shall mutually agree in
good faith on the determination of the Company's estimated Working Capital as
of the Closing (such amount, as mutually agreed, the "Estimated Working
Capital Amount"). Thereafter, and as a condition to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver a certificate executed by each Seller certifying as to (A) the
Estimated Working Capital, (B) the Indebtedness to be paid directly by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iii) and (C) the Transaction Expenses,
if any, to be paid directly by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iv).

  

  

(b) Adjustment of Closing Payment. The Closing Payment set forth in Section
2.02(a) shall be: (i) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Working Capital Amount exceeds the Working Capital Top Collar; and (ii)
decreased by the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Bottom Collar
exceeds the Estimated Working Capital Amount (such increase or decrease, the
"Closing Working Capital Payment"). In the event the Estimated Working Capital
Amount falls between the Working Capital Bottom Collar and the Working Capital
Top Collar, there shall be no Closing Working Capital Payment.

  

  

(c) Post-Closing Determination.

  

  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 90 days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall conduct a review of the Working Capital
and shall deliver to Agent: (A) a balance sheet of the Company as of the close
of business on the Closing prepared on the same basis and using the same
accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures that were
used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements Date (the "Closing
Balance Sheet"); (B) a statement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the
"Closing Statement") setting forth the actual amount of Working Capital, each
of which shall be prepared using the methodology set forth on Exhibit B (it
being understood that, except for the non-GAAP principles and methodologies
set forth on Exhibit B, the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP); (C) outstanding Indebtedness not
included in the calculation of the Closing Payment (if any); and (D)
Transaction Expenses not included in the calculation of the Closing Payment
(if any), in each case as of the close of business on the Closing Date with
supporting detail.

  

   

16 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(ii) Agent may accept the Closing Statement and computation of Working Capital
within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Statement. If Agent disagrees with
the computation of the Working Capital as reflected on the Closing Statement,
Agent may, within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a
notice (an "Objection Notice") to Parent setting forth Agent's calculation of
the Working Capital and a statement setting forth Agent's objections in
reasonable detail. Any amounts not specifically objected to by Agent in the
Objection Notice shall be deemed accepted. If Agent fails to deliver an
Objection Notice to Parent on or prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
referred to above, the Closing Statement and the calculation of Working
Capital set forth therein shall be final and binding on the Sellers and Agent.
If Agent delivers an Objection Notice on or prior to the expiration of the
30-day period referred to above, Parent and Agent shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any disagreements as to the computation of the Working
Capital, but if there is no final resolution with respect to any amounts
remaining in dispute (the "Disputed Amounts") within 20 days after Parent has
received the Objection Notice, Parent and Agent shall jointly retain the
Chicago, Illinois office of Ernst and Young LLP (the "Accounting Firm") to
resolve any disagreements relating only to the Disputed Amounts and to
determine the Final Working Capital Amount (as defined below). Parent and
Agent shall each submit all back-up documentation to the Accounting Firm
promptly (and in any event within 15 days after the Accounting Firm's
engagement), which documentation shall include such Party's computation of the
Working Capital and information, arguments and support for such Party's
position with respect to the Disputed Amounts. Parent and Agent shall also
have the right to present oral arguments relevant to the Accounting Firm's
resolution of the Disputed Amounts. Neither Purchaser nor Agent or any of
their respective Representatives shall have or conduct any communication,
either written or oral, with the Accounting Firm without the other Party
either being present or receiving a concurrent copy of any written
communication.

  

  

(iii) The Accounting Firm shall review all such documentation and shall
deliver its determination of the Disputed Amounts within 60 days after its
engagement, and shall base its determination solely on such documentation in
accordance with GAAP and in accordance with the definition of Working Capital
herein. In resolving such Disputed Amounts, the Accounting Firm may not assign
a value to any item greater than the greatest value used for such item claimed
by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by
either Party. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Parties.

  

  

(iv) Agent shall pay a portion of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
equal to 100% multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount
of Disputed Amounts submitted to the Accounting Firm that are resolved in
favor of Parent (that being the difference between the Accounting Firm's
determination and Agent's determination) and the denominator of which is the
total amount of the Disputed Amounts submitted to the Accounting Firm (that
being the sum total by which Parent's determination and Agent's determination
differ from the determination of the Accounting Firm). Parent shall pay that
portion of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm that Agent is not
required to pay hereunder.

  

  

(v) Parent agrees to provide Agent and its Representatives and the Accounting
Firm with full access to the Books and Records, accountant's work papers,
accounting personnel, and facilities of the Company during normal business
hours in order to complete their review of the Closing Statement and the
Closing Balance Sheet; provided, however, such access shall be in manner that
does not interfere with the normal operations of the Company.

(d) Post-Closing Adjustment.

  

  

(i) Once all disputes relating to the Working Capital are resolved in
accordance with Section 2.04(c) such that there is a final amount of Working
Capital (the "Final Working Capital Amount"), the final adjustment to the
Purchase Price in respect of Working Capital will be calculated as follows:

 

  

  

(A) If the Estimated Working Capital is above the Working Capital Top Collar
and:

  

  

(1) The Final Working Capital is more than the Estimated Working Capital, then
there shall be a "Working Capital Overage" equal to the Final Working Capital
minus the Estimated Working Capital;

  

  

(2) The Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, but
above the Working Capital Top Collar, then there shall be a "Working Capital
Shortage" equal to the Estimated Working Capital minus Final Working Capital;

  

  

(3) The Final Working Capital is between the Working Capital Bottom Collar and
Working Capital Top Collar, then there shall be a "Working Capital Shortage"
equal to the Estimated Working Capital minus the Working Capital Top Collar;
or

  

  

(4) The Final Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Bottom Collar,
then there shall be a "Working Capital Shortage" equal to the Estimated
Working Capital minus the Working Capital Top Collar plus the Working Capital
Bottom Collar minus the Final Working Capital.

  

  

(B) If the Estimated Working Capital is between the Working Capital Bottom
Collar and the Working Capital Top Collar and:

  

  

(1) The Final Working Capital is more than the Working Capital Top Collar,
then then there shall be a "Working Capital Overage" equal to equal to the
Final Working Capital minus the Working Capital Top Collar;

  

  

(2) The Final Working Capital is between the Working Capital Top Collar and
Working Capital Bottom Collar, then there shall be neither a "Working Capital
Shortage" nor a "Working Capital Overage"; or

  

  

(3) The Final Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Bottom Collar,
then then there shall be a "Working Capital Shortage" equal to the Working
Capital Bottom Collar minus the Final Working Capital.

  

  

(C) If the Estimated Working Capital is below the Working Capital Bottom
Collar and:

  

  

(1) The Final Working Capital is more than the Estimated Working Capital, but
below the Working Capital Bottom Collar, then there shall be a "Working
Capital Overage" equal to the Final Working Capital minus the Estimated
Working Capital;

  

  

(2) The Final Working Capital is more than the Estimated Working Capital but
between the Working Capital Bottom Collar and the Working Capital Top Collar,
then there shall be a "Working Capital Overage" equal to the Working Capital
Bottom Collar minus the Estimated Working Capital;

  

  

(3) The Final Working Capital is more than the Estimated Working Capital and
more than the Working Capital Top Collar, then there shall be a "Working
Capital Overage" equal to the Working Capital Bottom Collar minus the
Estimated Working Capital plus the Final Working Capital minus the Working
Capital Top Collar; or

  

  

(4) The Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital, then
then there shall be a "Working Capital Shortage" equal to the Estimated
Working Capital minus the Final Working Capital.

(ii) In the event of a Working Capital Shortage, Agent and Parent shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable and no later than five Business Days after the
determination of the Final Working Capital, instruct the Escrow Agent in
writing to pay as directed by Parent from the Working Capital Escrow Amount,
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the amount of such Working Capital
Shortage and shall disburse the remainder of the Working Capital Escrow Amount

directed by Parent, any remaining Working Capital Shortage from the General
Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(iii) In the event of a Working Capital Overage, Agent and Parent shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable and no later than five Business Days after the

immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account or accounts for
each Seller designated in writing by Agent.

  

  

(iv) If the Final Working Capital Amount is such that neither a Working

adjustment to the Purchase Price based on the Final Working Capital Amount and
Agent and Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than
five Business Days after the determination of the Final Working Capital,
instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to pay as directed by Agent the Working

---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Earn-Out. Following the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, Parent shall cause to be paid to Sellers, as additional
consideration in a single payment solely to the extent earned, the Earn-Out
Payment. The amount of the Earn-Out Payment shall not exceed fifteen million
dollars ($15,000,000) (the "Maximum Earn-Out Payment"), and subject thereto,
shall equal the dollar amount that results from the following calculation: "A"
plus "B" minus "C" (the "Earn-Out Formula"), where:

  

  

(i) "A" = The Adjusted Gross Profit earned during the Earn-Out Period that is
attributable to any of the Earn-Out Products set forth on Schedule 2.06(a)(i)
multiplied by 1/3;

  

  

(ii) "B" = The Adjusted Gross Profit earned during the Earn-Out Period that is
attributable to any of the Earn-Out Products set forth on Schedule 2.06(a)(ii)
multiplied by 1/4; and

  

  

(iii) "C" = (I) $7,000,000 in the event the sum of "A" and "B" is less than
$12,000,0000 or (II) $4,000,000 in the event the sum of "A" and "B" is greater
than or equal to $12,000,000.

  

  

No later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing or such other time as the
Parties mutually agree, (A) Agent and Purchaser shall modify Schedule
2.06(a)(i) so that it contains all of the Company's Earn-Out Products that are
not pipeline or current products of Parent or its Affiliates as of the
Closing, and (B) Agent and Purchaser shall modify Schedule 2.06(a)(ii) so that
it contains all of the Company's Earn-Out Products that are also pipeline or
current products of Parent or its Affiliates as of the Closing, in each case
as reasonably established by documented evidence exchanged between Agent and
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, Schedule 2.06(a)(i) and Schedule
2.06(a)(ii), as modified hereunder and in effect as of the Closing, shall be
deemed to be final for all purposes.

(b) Earn-Out Period; Interim Earn-Out Periods.

  

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Earn-Out Period" means the three year
period commencing on the first day of the calendar month following the Closing
Date (the "Earn-Out Commencement Date") and ending on the three year
anniversary thereof.

  

  

(ii) During the Earn-Out Period, there shall be three interim measurement
periods: (A) the 12-month period commencing on the Earn-Out Commencement Date
and ending on the one year anniversary of the Earn-Out Commencement Date (the
"First Measurement Period"); (B) the 12-month period commencing on the one
year anniversary of the Earn-Out Commencement Date and ending on the two year
anniversary of the Earn-Out Commencement Date (the "Second Measurement
Period"); and (C) the 12-month period commencing on the second anniversary of
the Earn-Out Commencement Date and ending on the third anniversary of the
Earn-Out Commencement Date (the "Third Measurement Period" and together with
the First Measurement Period and Second Measurement Period, the "Earn-Out
Measurement Periods").

  

  

(c) Interim Earn-Out Payments. As soon as practicable and no later than 90
days following the end of each of the First Measurement Period and Second
Measurement Period, Parent shall conduct a review of Adjusted Gross Profit of
the Products set forth on Schedules 2.06(a)(i)-(ii) (such Products,
collectively the "Earn-Out Products") for the then completed Earn-Out
Measurement Period and the estimated amount of earn-out consideration, if any,
earned during such completed Earn-Out Measurement Period (the "Interim Earn-
Out Payment"), and shall deliver to Agent a statement (an "Interim Earn-Out
Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's good faith calculation
of Adjusted Gross Profit for the then completed Earn-Out Measurement Period
and the Interim Earn-Out Payment for such completed Earn-Out Measurement
Period. As soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than five
Business Days after the delivery of the Interim Earn-Out Statement to Agent,
Purchaser shall deposit the Interim Earn-Out Payment, if any, with the Escrow
Agent in accordance with this Section 2.06(c) and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(d) Final Earn-Out Payment and Release of Earn-Out Escrow.

  

  

(i) As soon as practicable and no later than 90 days following the end of the
Earn-Out Period, Parent shall conduct a review of Adjusted Gross Profit of the
Earn-Out Products for the Earn-Out Period and the estimated Earn-Out Payment,
if any, earned during the Earn-Out Period (the "Estimated Final Earn-Out
Payment") and shall deliver to Agent a statement (an "Earn-Out Statement")
setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's good faith calculation of Adjusted
Gross Profit for the Earn-Out Period and the Estimated Final Earn-Out Payment.

  

  

(ii) After receipt of the Earn-Out Statement, Agent shall have 90 days to
review and accept the same. If Agent disagrees in good faith with the
computation of Adjusted Gross Profit or the Estimated Final Earn-Out Payment
reflected on the Earn-Out Statement on the basis that the same has not been
determined on the basis set forth in Section 2.06(a), Agent may, within 90
days after receipt of the Earn-Out Statement, deliver an objection notice (an
"Earn-Out Objection Notice") to Parent setting forth Agent's calculation of
Adjusted Gross Profit on the Earn-Out Products for the Earn-Out Period and the
Estimated Final Earn-Out Payment, if any, along with a statement setting forth
Agent's objections and adjustments to the Earn-Out Statement in reasonable
detail. If Agent fails to deliver an Earn-Out Objection Notice to Parent on or
prior to the expiration of the 90-day period referred to above, the Earn-Out
Statement and the calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and the Estimated Final
Earn-Out Payment set forth therein shall be final and binding on the Sellers
and Agent. If Agent delivers an Earn-Out Objection Notice on or prior to the
expiration of the 90-day period referred to above, Parent and Agent shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding the computation
of Adjusted Gross Profit or the Estimated Final Earn-Out Payment, if any, but
if there is no final resolution with respect to any Disputed Amounts within 20
days after Parent has received the Objection Notice, Parent and Agent shall
jointly retain the Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(ii), and
the provisions of Sections 2.04(c)(iii)-(v) shall apply mutatis mutandis to
the resolution of the foregoing dispute. Parent shall cause the Company to
make its Books and Records, accounting personnel and advisors as may be
reasonably requested available to Agent and the Accounting Firm at reasonable
times during the review by Agent and/or the Accounting Firm of the Earn-Out
Statement.

(iii) Once all disputes relating to the Earn-Out Statement for the Earn-Out
Period are resolved in accordance with Section 2.06(d)(ii) such that there is
a final Earn-Out Payment determined (the "Final Earn-Out Payment"), and
subject to the other terms and conditions herein, Parent and Agent shall,
within five Business Days of the determination of the Final Earn-Out Payment:

  

  

(A) to the extent the Final Earn-Out Payment exceeds the amount held in the
Earn-Out Escrow Account: (I) Parent and Agent shall execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute
all amounts held in the Earn-Out Escrow Account as directed by Agent; and (II)
Parent shall pay any remaining Final Earn-Out Payment in the manner directed
by Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to
the account or accounts for each Seller designated in writing by Agent; and

  

  

(B) to the extent the amount held in the Earn-Out Escrow Account exceeds the
Final Earn-Out Payment, Parent and Agent shall execute joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to (I)
distribute the amount of the Final Earn-Out Payment from the amounts held in
the Earn-Out Escrow Account as directed by Agent and (II) disburse the
remaining amounts held in the Earn-Out Escrow Account as directed by Parent.

  

  

(e) Earn-Out Standard. Parent and its Affiliates shall act in a commercially
reasonable manner to develop and commercialize the Earn-Out Products during
the Earn-Out Period and shall not take any action during the Earn-Out Period
which is solely intended to prevent or frustrate the achievement of Adjusted
Gross Profit for the purpose of reducing the Earn-Out Payment. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, Parent and its Affiliates shall be free to operate the
Company's business in the manner deemed by them to be in the best interest of
Parent. The Company and each Seller acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
provision is the sole standard by which Parent and its Affiliates shall be
judged with respect to the achievement of the Earn-Out Payment and the other
matters set forth in this Section 2.06(e).

  

  

(f) Acceleration upon Achievement of Maximum Earn-Out Payment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that after the end of
either the First Measurement Period or the Second Measurement Period the
Maximum Earn-Out Payment has been achieved pursuant to the Earn-Out Formula,
as set forth on the Interim Earn-Out Statement(s) delivered to Agent pursuant
to Section 2.06(c): (A) Parent and Agent, as soon as reasonably practicable
and no later than five (5) Business Days after the delivery of the most recent
Interim Earn-Out Statement, shall execute joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute all amounts held in
the Earn-Out Escrow Account as directed by Agent; and (B) within five (5)
Business Days after the delivery of the most recent Interim Earn-Out
Statement, Parent shall pay the remaining amount of the Earn-Out Payment due
in the manner directed by Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in U.S. dollars to the account or accounts for each Seller designated in
writing by Agent.

(g) Acceleration upon Occurrence of Certain Change-in-Control Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) In the event: (A) any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates) shall
become the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act),
directly or indirectly, of 50% or more the of the equity securities of the
Company, Purchaser or any material U.S. Affiliate thereof primarily engaged in
the development and distribution of generic and branded generic pharmaceutical
products; or (B) of any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one or a
series of related transactions) of greater than 50% of the operating assets of
Parent, the Company, Purchaser or any material U.S. Affiliate thereof, in each
case primarily engaged in the development and distribution of generic and
branded generic pharmaceutical products (each a "Pharmaceutical Change-in-
Control Event"), Sellers shall be deemed to have earned the Maximum Earn-Out
Payment. In such event, as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than
five Business Days following the applicable Pharmaceutical Change-in-Control
Event, Parent and Agent: (I) shall execute joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute all amounts held in
the Earn-Out Escrow Account as directed by Agent; and (II) Parent shall pay
any remaining Earn-Out Payment in the manner directed by Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account or
accounts for each Seller designated in writing by Agent on behalf of the
Sellers.

  

  

(ii) In the event: (A) any Person (other than Parent or its Affiliates) shall
become the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act),
directly or indirectly, of 50% or more the of the equity securities of Parent;
or (B) any merger or consolidation to which Parent is a party (other than a
merger or consolidation with its Affiliates), if, immediately after any such
merger or consolidation, the persons who hold a majority of the voting control
of the surviving entity are not persons who held a majority of the voting
control of Parent immediately prior to such transaction (each a "Parent
Change-in-Control Event"), Sellers shall be entitled to receive an amount
equal to the total Earn-Out Payment earned as of the date of such Parent
Change-in-Control Event. In such event, as soon as reasonably practicable and
no later than five Business Days following the applicable Parent Change-in-
Control Event, Parent (or any successor-in-interest) thereto and Agent: (I)
shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to distribute all amounts held in the Earn-Out Escrow Account as
directed by Agent; and (II) Parent (or any successor-in-interest thereto)
shall pay any remaining Earn-Out Payment earned by Sellers as of the date of
the Parent Change-in-Control Event in the manner directed by Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account or
accounts for each Seller designated in writing by Agent. Notwithstanding the
accelerated Earn-Out Payment provided for in this Section 2.06(g)(ii), Parent
(or any successor-in-interest thereto) shall continue to be obligated to pay
any remaining Earn-Out Payment earned by Sellers during the Earn-Out Period,
as and when earned and payable under the provisions of Section 2.06(d).

  

  

(h) Transfer of Stock Consideration upon Certain Change-in-Control
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
the Lock-Up Issuance Agreement, in the event there is a Pharmaceutical Change-
in-Control Event or a Parent Change-in-Control Event, then the Sellers shall
be permitted to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose, in whole or in
part, their Stock Consideration free of the transfer restrictions imposed
under the Lock-Up Issuance Agreement.

  

  

(i) Other Provisions.

  

  

(i) In the event that Parent (or any successor-in-interest thereto) fails to
timely make the Final Earn-Out Payment pursuant to the terms of this Section
2.06, whether as a result of restrictions contained in any debt Contracts of
Parent and its Affiliates or otherwise, such unpaid amount shall accrue
interest at the LIBOR Rate plus 10%, per annum compounded annually from the
date such payment is due until paid in full.

  

   

25 
--- 

 


--- 

   



    

  

(ii) Parent shall have a right to set off all or any portion of the Final
Earn-Out Payment otherwise payable to any Seller hereunder against amounts
determined to be then payable to any Purchaser Indemnitee under ARTICLE XI of
this Agreement.

  

  

(iii) No Seller may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his or
its right to receive the Final Earn-Out Payment other than transfers by will
or intestacy in connection with the death of such Seller, and any transfer in
violation of this provision shall be null and void and shall not be recognized
by Parent, Purchaser or Agent.

  

  

(iv) From the Closing Date until and including the date falling 18 months
after the Closing Date (the "Initial Period"), the Company shall not sell,
exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Earn-Out Products or any of the
Company Owned Intellectual Property and Company Licensed Intellectual Property
underlying any such Earn-Out Product, other than to Parent or its Affiliates
(each, a "Product Transfer"), except that if a Product Transfer is required by
a Governmental Authority to be consummated during the Initial Period, then the
Company shall be permitted to engage in any such Product Transfer and an
additional amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the net proceeds
received by the Company in connection with such Product Transfer shall be
added to and included in any Earn-Out Payment (subject to the Maximum Earn-Out
Payment cap). From the expiration of the Initial Period until the end of the
Earn-Out Period, the Company shall be permitted to engage in Product Transfers
in its sole discretion, provided that an additional amount equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the net proceeds received by the Company in connection
with any such Product Transfer occurring during such period shall be added to
and included in any Earn-Out Payment (subject to the Maximum Earn-Out Payment
cap). In the event of a Product Transfer, Company shall pay such amount
attributable to the Earn-Out Payment within ten days of the closing of such
Product Transfer in the manner directed by Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account or accounts for
each Seller designated in writing by Agent.

  

  

(v) In the event any Earn-Out Payment is required to be paid to the Sellers
pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof, Parent shall determine and report
to the appropriate Governmental Authority the amount of such payment which is
treated as interest for Income Tax purposes, as provided by Sections 1271
through 1275 of the Code and related Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, if any, with such interest amount being referred to herein as the
"Imputed Interest Amount." The Parties acknowledge and agree that no separate
cash payment of interest will be made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to
the Earn-Out Payment, and neither Parent nor Purchaser shall have any
liability whatsoever with respect to any Tax obligations of the Sellers with
respect to any Imputed Interest Amount.

  

  

(vi) To the extent permitted by law, any amount paid to Sellers pursuant to
this Section 2.06 (other than the portion characterized as the Imputed
Interest Amount) shall be treated by the Parties for Income Tax purposes as
having been given in exchange for "goodwill" and "going concern value," as
such terms are defined in Code Sections 197(d)(1)(A) and 197(d)(1)(B) in a
transaction characterized as an "installment sale" as such term is defined in
Code Section 453.

  

  

2.07 Tax Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any of the
Sellers, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or
under the provisions of any other applicable state or local Income Tax or
other Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Sellers in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

2.08 Income Tax Characterization. For Income Tax purposes, Purchaser's
purchase of the Purchased Units from each of the Sellers is intended to be
characterized, and shall be treated by all Parties on all Income Tax Returns,
as described in Situation 2 of IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6, specifically: (a) with
respect to the Sellers, a sale of the Purchased Units by the Sellers; and (b)
with respect to Purchaser, a deemed acquisition, by purchase, of all of the
Company's assets from the Sellers.

Intellectual Property was created solely by either (i) bona fide employees of
the Company acting within the scope of their employment (which Acquired
Intellectual Property has been transferred to Company validly and correctly)
or (ii) independent contractors or employees of third parties who (or whose
employers have) validly and irrevocably assigned all of their rights,
including rights to all Intellectual Property therein, to the Company. The

operation of the Business, as previously or currently conducted, or as
currently proposed to be conducted by the Company infringes any Intellectual
Property right of a third party.

manufacturing, licensing or distribution set forth on Schedule 4.11(a) or on

the Company pursuant to "shrink wrap" licenses); (ii) each Contract,
assignment or other instrument pursuant to which the Company has obtained any
joint or sole ownership interest in or to each item of Company Owned
Intellectual Property; and (iii) each Contract or other instrument pursuant to
which the Company has obtained any ownership or license interest in
Intellectual Property developed by a consultant, developer or vendor to the
Company.

any payment (whether of separation, severance or termination pay or
otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution

any current or former officer, employee or other service provider of the
Company, or give rise to any obligation to fund any such payment or benefit,

(e) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan and all related trusts, insurance
Contracts and funds have been maintained, funded and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and all applicable Laws,
including ERISA and the Code. Neither the Company nor any trustee or
administrator of any Company Employee Benefit Plan, nor any other person has
engaged in any transaction with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan
that could subject the Company or any trustee or administrator of such Company
Employee Benefit Plan, or any party dealing with such Company Employee Benefit
Plan, to any Tax or penalty (whether civil or otherwise) imposed by Applicable
Law. No Proceedings with respect to the Company Employee Benefit Plans (other
than routine claims for benefits) or any fiduciary or other person dealing
with such Company Employee Benefit Plans are pending or, to the Knowledge of

Tax-exempt status of such related trust, or has been established pursuant to a
prototype plan that has received a favorable EGTRRA opinion or advisory letter
from the IRS. To the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred and no
circumstance exists that could adversely affect the qualified status of such
Company Employee Benefit Plan or result in a requirement to voluntarily
correct any qualification defects to maintain the qualified status of the
plan.

delivered or made available to Purchaser a true, complete and correct copy of
(i) such Company Employee Benefit Plan (or, if not written, a written summary

6.07 Insurance. Parent agrees that it shall cause the Company: (a) to purchase
and maintain (at Parent's sole cost and expense) fully prepaid "tail"
insurance coverage to the current policy of directors' and officers' liability

occurred on or before the Closing; and (b) maintain product liability
insurance covering all Products distributed by the Company prior to the
Closing Date for a period from Closing through and including the date that is
seven years after the Closing Date. Upon request of Agent, Parent or its

(e.g., a certificate of insurance with respect thereto). The tail policy
purchased under subsection (a) in this Section 6.07 shall constitute the sole
recourse and source of recovery of any Seller against the Company with respect
to any claim for acts or occurrences prior to Closing. Attached to Exhibit L
hereto are the Broker of Record Letters executed by the Company appointing
Willis of Illinois, Inc. as broker of record on the Company directors' and
officers' liability insurance and product liability insurance policies
identified therein, which will allow Parent to procure and maintain the
insurance policies identified in subsections (a) and (b) above in this Section
6.07. The Company shall not withdraw or revoke such Broker of Record Letters
unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article IX hereof.

(a) Disclosure Schedule Updates.

  

  

(i) Within three Business Days of the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall deliver an updated Disclosure Schedule solely to reflect any matter or
information that was initially redacted from the Disclosure Scheduled
delivered prior to the date of this Agreement, which information is to be
disclosed to Parent, Purchaser and their respective Representatives as part of
the Phase II Diligence. For purposes of this Agreement, the updated Disclosure
Schedule to be delivered pursuant to this Section 6.08(a), shall supersede and
replace the initial Disclosure Schedule in all respects, including, without
limitation, determining compliance with the representations and warranties set
forth in ARTICLE IV and determining whether the conditions set forth in
Section 8.02(a) (and, for avoidance of doubt, not Section 8.02(f)) have been
satisfied.

  

  

(ii) The Company may, by delivery at least five Business Days prior to the
Closing, supplement and update the Disclosure Schedule to reflect any matter
or information arising after the date of this Agreement that is required to be
disclosed pursuant to Section 6.05(d); provided that such update, supplement
or amendment to the Disclosure Schedule shall not: (a) not cure or otherwise
affect any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant occurring on the
date of this Agreement or at the Closing Date; or (b) be deemed to have
modified the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company herein
for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII
have been satisfied.

within ten (10) Business Days after the end of each fiscal quarter, unaudited
quarter-end balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and related unaudited

correct and complete in all material respects; (B) be derived from and
prepared in accordance with the information contained in the Books and
Records; (C) be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
throughout the periods covered thereby; and (D) present accurately and fairly
in all material respects the assets, liabilities (including all reserves),
financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the times
and for the periods referred to therein, subject to, with respect to the
Additional Unaudited Statements, (1) the absence of footnote disclosures and
other presentation items, and (2) changes resulting from normal year-end
adjustments (the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate,
be material). Upon delivery to the Purchaser, the Additional Unaudited
Statements shall be considered "Unaudited Financials" for purposes of this
Agreement. There shall be no changes in the method of application of the
Company's accounting policies or changes in the method of applying the
Company's use of estimates in the preparation of the Updated Financials as
compared with the Audited Financial Statements.

  

  

6.09 Payout Spreadsheet. The Company shall deliver as soon as practicable but
not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, a Payout Spreadsheet

OTHER COVENANTS

  

  

7.01 Further Assurances.

  

  

(a) After the Closing, and without further consideration, each Seller
covenants and agrees that he or it will execute and deliver to Purchaser such
further instruments of transfer and assignment as Purchaser may reasonably
request in order to more effectively convey and transfer the Purchased Units
to Purchaser.

  

  

(b) Each of the Sellers covenants and agrees to execute any and all documents
and to perform such other acts as may be necessary or expedient to further the
purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

7.02 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Company, to provide Agent and its Representatives with
reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal
business hours, to the Books and Records of the Company solely for the purpose
of preparing or responding to any inquiry regarding any Tax Returns of a
Seller or the Company required to be filed by the Sellers or Agent, including
any Tax Returns filed by the Company with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.
The Company shall not, for a period of six years following the Closing Date,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the Books and Records of the
Company related to Taxes during a Pre-Closing Tax Period without first

7.03 Confidentiality. Each Seller covenants and agrees that he or it will, and
that he or it will cause each of his or its Affiliates, Related Parties and
their respective Representatives to, for a period of five years after the
Closing Date (except with regards to Trade Secrets for which the duration
shall be perpetual), keep confidential and not, directly or indirectly,
divulge to any Person or use for his or its own benefit, any Confidential
Information, except for disclosures requested or required by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal Proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process, and then only in
accordance with the procedure hereinafter described, or otherwise required by
Law (including disclosures required in any Tax Return). "Confidential
Information" means: (a) the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including
the consideration to be paid hereunder), the course of dealing between the
Parties hereunder (including any dispute between the Parties) and the
occurrence of the Transaction and any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and (b) any Trade Secrets or proprietary
information of the Company, including plans for research or products,
databases, computer programs, other original works of authorship, marketing
and sales plans, business plans, budgets and financial information, prices and
costs, customer lists, supplier lists, information regarding the skills and
compensation of the employees and contractors of the Company and any other
non-public business information. The term "Confidential Information" includes
all of the foregoing information, rights and materials, whether tangible or
intangible, whether in written, oral, chemical, magnetic, photographic,
optical or other form, in all stages of research and development, and whether
now existing, or previously developed or created. The term "Confidential
Information" does not include any information that is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result, directly or indirectly, of a
breach of this Section 7.03, or other legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality owing to Purchaser, Parent or the Company, by any Person that
is subject to this Section 7.03. If any Person that is subject to this Section
7.03 is requested or required to disclose any Confidential Information
pursuant to a subpoena, court order or other similar process, such Person must
provide written notice to Purchaser of such request or requirement so that
Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or such other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded to the Confidential
Information. In the event that no such protective order is issued or assurance
regarding confidential treatment is obtained, and such Person is, based on
written advice of his or its counsel, compelled to disclose such Confidential
Information under threat of liability for contempt of court or other censure
or penalty, such Person may disclose Confidential Information that such
Person's counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed in accordance
with and for the limited purpose of compliance with such subpoena, court order
or process, without liability under this Section 7.03.

  

  

    

7.04

  |  

Employees.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Post-Closing Employee Salary and Wages. Upon the Closing, each Company
Employee shall continue his or her employment with the Company on an at-will
basis at salary or hourly wage rates (as the case may be) generally comparable
to the salary or wage rates received by the Company Employee as of immediately
prior to the Closing, provided such Company Employee has satisfied Purchaser's
standard employment prerequisites applicable to its employees, the employment
of Company Employee would not otherwise be prohibited by Law, have an adverse
effect on Purchaser's business or be contrary to pharmaceutical industry best
practices with respect to compliance (such qualifying employees, the "Post-
Closing Employees"). For the avoidance of doubt, the employment of a Company
Employee may not be continued if that Company Employee is or has been: (i)
debarred pursuant to the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 (21 U.S.C. §
335a), as amended from time to time; (ii) excluded, debarred, or suspended
from, or otherwise ineligible to participate in, a "Federal Health Care
Program" as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(f), as amended from time to time,
or any other governmental payment, procurement or non-procurement program;
(iii) included on the HHS/OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities, the
General Services Administration's List of Parties Excluded from Federal
Programs, or the FDA Debarment List; (iv) convicted of a criminal offense that
falls within the ambit of 21 U.S.C. § 335a or 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7, but has not
yet been excluded, debarred, suspended or otherwise declared ineligible; (v)
convicted of any offense under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or in
any way otherwise relating to the development or approval, including the
process for development or approval, of any drug product; or (vi) convicted of
any offense in connection with the delivery of or payment for a health care
benefit, item, or service.

(b) Post-Closing Employee Benefits. From and after the Closing Date until the
date falling three months after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Company to extend to the Post-Closing Employees that continue to be employed
by the Company, Parent or its Affiliates (including their eligible dependents)
benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements (in each case other than equity and severance arrangements)
received by them from the Company immediately prior to Closing. To the extent
that the Post-Closing Employees are employed by the Company, Parent or its
Affiliates after the date falling three months after the Closing Date, they
will be offered certain benefits under the plans maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion. Any Post-Closing
Employee terminated prior to the date falling six months after the Closing
Date shall receive as their exclusive severance payment an amount equal to 2
weeks of salary for every year of service with the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall assume any liability with
respect to, and the Sellers shall remain responsible for, severance
agreements, plans or policies for the Company Employees in effect as of the
Closing Date and the Company shall provide to Purchaser evidence of
termination of all severance arrangements before the Closing Date, other than
the severance arrangements with the Persons set forth on Schedule 7.04(b)(i).
Notwithstanding anything stated herein, the Sellers shall be responsible for
any severance payments to the Persons set forth on Schedule 7.04(b)(ii).

  

  

(c) Limitations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Company Employees
and the Post-Closing Employees are not intended to be third party
beneficiaries under, and shall have no rights (including any right to
continued employment) in respect of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
including this Section 7.04. Nothing contained in this Section 7.04 shall: (i)
be construed to restrict Parent's, Purchaser's, the Company's or any of their
respective Affiliates' ability after the Closing Date to terminate the
employment of any Post-Closing Employee; or (ii) shall constitute an amendment
to or any other modification of any employee benefit or other compensatory
plan, policy or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that after the
Closing, it is anticipated that the Company will be liquidated into an
Affiliate of Parent. Parent and Purchaser may freely transfer the employment
of the Post-Closing Employees to any of Parent's Affiliates or their
respective Subsidiaries, subject to the obligations set forth in Section
7.04(a) and (b).

  

  

7.05 Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agrees that Sellers shall be
permitted to cause, and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to cause,
all Cash and Cash Equivalents held by the Company as of the Closing to be
transferred to Sellers prior to the Closing. Purchaser and Parent agree that
if any cash or cash equivalents held by the Company as of the Closing Date is
not transferred to Sellers prior to the Closing, then such Cash and Cash
Equivalents shall be promptly transferred in the manner directed by Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account or
accounts for each Seller designated in writing by Agent.

(a) Parent and the Sellers may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent at any time prior to the Closing;

  

  

(b) At any time after May 9, 2014 (the "Outside Date"), either Parent or any
Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to non-
terminating Party if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before such

Agreement by the terminating Party;

  

  

(c) Either Parent or any Seller may terminate this Agreement at any time
before the Closing by giving written notice to the other Parties in the event
that any Order or Law becomes effective restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements;

  

  

(d) Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Sellers and the Company at any time prior to the Closing, if: (i) any Seller
or the Company has materially breached or failed to comply with its

expected to be satisfied, and such breach or failure to comply is incapable of
being cured by the Outside Date; and/or (ii) a Phase II Diligence Termination
Event has occurred; provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to

10.07.

  

  

(b) In the case of Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) that are payable with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be: (i) in the case of Income Taxes or any other Taxes resulting from,
or imposed on, sales, receipts, uses, transfers or assignments of property or
other assets, payments or accruals to other persons (including wages), or any
other similar transaction or transactions, the amount that would be payable
for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date if the
Company filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes solely for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the
case of any Taxes that are imposed based upon the passage of time, an amount
equal to the amount of Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of clause
(i) above, any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including
amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates)
shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle
Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

Tax Returns.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) The Sellers shall, at the Sellers' expense, cause to be prepared and
timely filed: (i) the final Income Tax Returns for the Company for the portion
of calendar year 2014 ending with the close of business on the Closing Date;
and (ii) all other Tax Returns of the Company that relate to Tax periods
ending on or before the Closing Date that are due on or before the Closing
Date (collectively, "Seller Prepared Returns"). To the extent permitted under
applicable Law, the Seller Prepared Returns shall be prepared in accordance
with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods of the Company
as in effect on the date hereof. The Sellers shall furnish such Seller
Prepared Returns to Parent for its review at least 20 days prior to the due
date (including any extensions thereof) for filing such Seller Prepared
Returns and the Sellers shall consider Purchaser's comments in good faith. To
the extent that the Taxes due with respect to any such Seller Prepared Returns
are not adequately provided for in determining the Final Working Capital,
Sellers shall pay such Taxes at the time such Seller Prepared Return is filed.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02(a), Parent shall, at
Parent's expense, cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns of the
Company that are required to be filed after the Closing Date that relate to
any period prior to the Closing Date including, but not limited to, Tax
Returns for any Straddle Period. Purchaser shall furnish such Tax Returns to
Agent for its review at least 20 days prior to the due date (including any
extensions thereof) for filing such Tax Returns and Parent shall consider
Agent's comments in good faith. To the extent that the Taxes due with respect
to any such Tax Return are not adequately provided for in determining the
Final Working Capital, Sellers shall reimburse Parent for such Taxes within
five (5) Business Days of Parent's written request, to the extent such Taxes
are attributable to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date
(or any portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date).

  

  

    

10.03

Cooperation.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Each of the Parties shall provide each other with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by any other Party in connection with the preparation
of any Tax Return or any Tax Contest. Such assistance shall include making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis, and at no cost to the
requesting Party, to provide additional information or explanation of material
provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns
and supporting material.

  

  

(b) Parent shall or shall cause Company and its Subsidiaries to (i) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including any extensions thereof) applicable to such taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority, and (ii) provide Agent with reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if Agent so requests, Parent will allow Agent to take possession of such
books and records.

  

  

10.04 Tax Contests. In the event that any Governmental Authority informs a
Party of any audit, litigation, dispute, or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
(collectively, a "Tax Contest"), the Party so informed shall notify the other
Party of such matter promptly, and in all events within five (5) Business
Days, after receiving notice of such Tax Contest; provided that failure to
promptly notify shall not reduce the other Party's indemnity obligation
hereunder except to the extent such Party's ability to defend against such
matter is actually prejudiced thereby. Agent shall, at Sellers' cost and
expense, control the conduct and defense of any Tax Contest relating to Tax
matters of the Company for periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and
Agent shall, at Sellers' cost and expense, control the conduct and defense of
any Tax Contest relating to Tax matters of the Company for any Straddle
Period; provided, however, Parent may, at its option, elect to jointly control
such Tax Contest, at its own cost and expense, related to any Straddle Period
and, if the Company could be held liable for any Tax obligations related
thereto, any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Each Party shall, however, keep the other
Party informed of all developments on a timely basis, shall provide the other
Party with copies of any and all written correspondence received from the
Governmental Authority related to such Tax Contest and shall provide the other
Party with the opportunity to attend conferences, hearings and other meetings
with or involving the Governmental Authority and to review and provide
comments with respect to written responses provided to the Governmental
Authority with respect to such Tax Contest. Each Party shall consult the other
Party and obtain the other Party's consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to accepting any proposed adjustment
or entering into any settlement or agreement in compromise regarding any Taxes
to the extent such proposed adjustment, settlement or agreement in compromise
would give rise to an indemnification obligation pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

10.05 Refunds. Any refund or other overpayment of Taxes (including any
interest with respect thereto) of the Company for any period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (including refunds attributable to the portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) shall, to the extent such Tax
refund, overpayment and/or interest is not reflected as an asset in Final
Working Capital, be the property of the Sellers, net of any expenses. If
Parent or the Company receives any such Tax refund, overpayment, or interest
after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to pay over
such Tax refund, an amount equivalent to any overpayment and/or interest to
the Sellers, to the extent such Tax refund, overpayment and/or interest is not
reflected as an asset in Final Working Capital, within five (5) Business Days
of receipt of such Tax refund, net of any expenses.

  

  

10.06 Post-Closing Actions. Unless required by a change in circumstance or Law
occurring after the Closing Date, without the advance written consent of the
Agent, neither the Company, Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall: (a) (i) initiate contact with any Governmental Authorities in relevant
jurisdictions to disclose any actual or potential inaccuracies, errors or
omissions relating to how the Company dealt with its Tax reporting obligations
prior to the Closing Date; (iii) change any election made by the Company prior
to the Closing Date with respect to Taxes; or (ii) file any Tax Return for or
on behalf of the Company that was not filed by the Company prior to the
Closing Date, if a reasonably foreseeable consequence of any such action would
be to increase any of the Sellers' potential liability to either make
indemnification payments under this Agreement or result in the imposition of
additional liability for Taxes on such Seller, or (b) file any written
agreement setting forth the terms of a remediation framework (the "Framework")
relating to any sales and use Taxes arising prior to the Closing Date, unless
mutually agreed upon and negotiated in good faith by the Parties.

  

  

10.07 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, sales, use, documentary, property, or
similar Taxes applicable to, imposed upon or arising out of the transfer of
the Membership Interests or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement ("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid 50% by Purchaser and 50% by the
Sellers.

  

  

10.08 Adjustments to Purchase Price. All payments by any Sellers to Purchaser
or by Purchaser/Parent or the Company after the Closing to any Seller under
this ARTICLE X shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

  

10.09 Allocation of Purchase Price. Purchaser and the Sellers agree that the
Purchase Price (including assumed liabilities) shall be allocated among the
assets of the Company based upon the fair market values thereof in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code. Within the latter of 90 calendar days after the
Closing Date or determination of the Final Working Capital Amount, Parent
shall cause to be delivered to Agent the initial asset allocation statement on
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (or successor form) on a basis consistent
with the principles set forth on Schedule 10.09 (the "Initial Allocation").
Agent shall have the right to review and raise any objections with Parent in
writing to the Initial Allocation within 30 calendar days after the receipt
thereof. If Agent does not timely raise any objections, the Initial Allocation
shall become the "Final Allocation." If Agent disagrees with respect to any
material item in the Initial Allocation, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable, within 20 calendar
days after receipt by Parent of such notice of objections, to resolve the
disputed items, such disputed items will be referred to the Accounting Firm
and, except as set forth specifically in this Section 10.09, the procedures
set forth in Section 2.04(c) shall be followed and apply with respect to such
dispute mutatis mutandis. The Accounting Firm shall, within 60 calendar days,
deliver to Parent and Agent a written report setting forth its determination
as to such disputed items (and only such disputed items), and its
determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties thereto for
purposes of the Final Allocation. The Accounting Firm's fees, costs and
expenses shall be borne equally by each Party. Parent and the Sellers agree to
report the transactions contemplated herein in accordance with the Final
Allocation for all Tax reporting purposes and to not take any position during
the course of any audit or other proceeding inconsistent with the Final
Allocation, unless required by a final non-appealable determination of the
applicable Governmental Authority.

Claim Procedure/Notice of Claim.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) A Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee entitled or seeking to assert
rights to indemnification under this ARTICLE XI (an "Indemnified Party") shall
give prompt written notification (a "Claim Notice") to Agent (on behalf of the
Sellers) or Purchaser, as applicable, from whom indemnification is sought (an
"Indemnifying Party") which contains (i) a copy of all papers served, if any,
and a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this ARTICLE XI for such Losses and a reasonable explanation of the
basis therefor and (ii) the amount or, if not then reasonably determinable,
the estimated amount, determined in good faith, of the Loss arising from such
claim (the "Claimed Amount"); provided, however, that no delay or deficiency
on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder,
unless the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay,
deficiency or failure. In the event that the Indemnified Party is entitled or
seeking rights to indemnification under this ARTICLE XI which is not related
to a third party claim, the provisions of Sections 11.05(a)-(c) shall govern.

  

  

(b) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response (the "Response") in
which the Indemnifying Party shall either: (i) agree that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount; (ii) dispute that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any or all of the Claimed Amount; or
(iii) indicate that the Indemnifying Party does not yet have, and does not
expect to have within such 30-day period, sufficient information to determine
whether the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any or all the Claimed
Amount (in the event of clause (ii) or (iii), the response shall be referred
to as an "Claim Objection Notice"). If no response is delivered by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to the
entire Claimed Amount shall be payable to the Indemnified Party and such
Claimed Amount shall be promptly (and in any event within ten Business Days)
paid to the Indemnified Party.

  

  

(c) In the event that following delivery of a Claim Objection Notice the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to agree on whether
Losses exist or on the amount of such Losses or on whether the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder for any or all such Losses
within the 30-day period after delivery of a Claim Objection Notice, either
the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party may (but is not required to)
petition or file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution
of such dispute.

  

  

(d) In the event that the Indemnified Party is entitled or is seeking to
assert rights to indemnification under this ARTICLE XI relating to a third
party claim, the provisions of Section 11.05(d)-(g) shall apply. In such
event, the Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any suit or other legal proceeding
relating to such third party claim. Such notification shall be given as soon
as reasonably practicable, but in all cases within 30 days after receipt by
the Indemnified Party of notice of such suit or proceeding, shall be
accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation submitted by such third
party (to the extent then in the possession of the Indemnified Party) and
shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified
Party) the facts constituting the basis for such suit or proceeding and the
amount of the claimed Losses, if then known; provided, however, that no delay
or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or
obligation hereunder except to the extent of any liability caused by or
arising out of such delay, deficiency or failure. If a third party claim is
brought against an Indemnified Party and it gives proper notice to the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such third party claim, the
Indemnifying Party will, unless the claim involves Taxes, be entitled to
participate in such third party claim and, to the extent that it wishes
(unless (i) any Seller Party (if any Seller is the Indemnifying Party) or
Parent or its Affiliates (if Parent or its Affiliates is the Indemnifying
Party) is also a party to such third party claim and the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or
(ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such third party claim
and provide indemnification with respect to such third party claim) to assume
the defense of such third party claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such third party
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, as long as it actively and diligently
conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE
XI for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such third party claim, in each case incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense of such third party claim for the period
that the Indemnifying Party is actively defending such claim.

(e) If proper notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of
any third party claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such third party
claim: (i) the Indemnified Party will thereafter consult with the Indemnifying
Party upon the Indemnifying Party's reasonable request for such consultation
from time to time with respect to such claim or Proceeding; (ii) if the
Indemnifying Party does later deliver to the Indemnified Party the
aforementioned written acknowledgement, then the Indemnifying Party will have
the right to assume control of such defense and appoint lead counsel for the
remainder of such defense, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, or the Indemnifying Party may retain and direct the lead
counsel previously retained by the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnifying
Party will no longer be required to pay the fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party (unless such counsel is retained as lead
counsel by the Indemnifying Party) so long as the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in any transition of such
lead counsel; (iii) the Indemnifying Party will thereafter consult with the
Indemnified Party upon the Indemnified Party's reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such claim or Proceeding; and
(iv) the Indemnified Party shall not compromise, discharge or settle or admit
liability in connection with such claims without the Indemnifying Party's
prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed unless such settlement or compromise includes provision
for non-monetary relief).

  

  

(f) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a third party claim: (i)
no compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of liability in
connection with, such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without
the Indemnified Party's prior written consent unless (A) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of any Legal Requirement or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages which are paid fully by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of
such claims effected by the Indemnified Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party in connection
with such defense, and shall have the right to participate, at the Indemnified
Party's sole expense, in such defense, with counsel selected by it.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Indemnifying Party fails to
conduct the defense or handling of any third party claim in good faith after
having assumed such defense or handling, then the Indemnifying Party shall no
longer have the right to defend such third party claim and the provisions of
Section 11.05(d) shall govern.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a third party claim may
materially adversely affect it other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it could be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the
exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such third party claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not enter into any compromise or settlement in
connection with any such third party claim without the Indemnifying Party's
prior written consent unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of any Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any
Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
Indemnifying Party, and (ii) the sole relief for which Indemnifying Party is
responsible is monetary damages.

11.02(b), (d), (e) and (f) in excess of the Purchase Price, in the aggregate.

  

  

(ii) Parent shall have no liability, in the aggregate, under Section 11.03 in
excess of $6,500,000; provided, however, such limitation shall not apply to
Section 11.03(b) and Section 11.03(c). Parent shall have no liability under
Section 11.03(b) and Section 11.03(c) in excess of the Purchase Price, in the
aggregate.

  

  

(c) No Double Indemnity. No claim for indemnification may be made by a
Purchaser Indemnitee and no indemnification shall be required to the extent
that the Loss sustained or incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee for which
indemnification is sought were included in the calculation of Working Capital
or deducted from the Closing Payment.

  

  

(d) Effect of Knowledge. Except with respect to matters known to Parent,
Purchaser, any Affiliate of Parent or Purchaser or any of their respective
Representatives as of the date of this Agreement involving, or otherwise
related to compliance (for failure to comply) with U.S. and foreign tax Laws
relating to any withholding tax due or payable with respect to a foreign
Person, the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation, inquiry or examination conducted at any
time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing Date. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

  

  

11.07 Exclusive Remedies. Following the Closing, the rights and remedies of
the Parties under this ARTICLE XI are exclusive and in lieu of any and all
other rights and remedies which the Parties may have under this Agreement or
otherwise against each other with respect to the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for monetary relief with respect
to any breach of any representation or warranty or any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, other than those which
arise from fraud or willful misconduct, and each Party expressly waives any
and all other rights or causes of action it or its Affiliates may have against
the other Party or its Affiliates now or in the future under any Law with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

Satisfaction of Claims.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Each Seller's indemnification obligation for Losses suffered by any
Purchaser Indemnitee for which such Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to
payment under this ARTICLE XI shall be satisfied, at Parent's sole option, by
any one or more of the following:

  

  

(i) Parent shall be entitled to set off the amount of such Loss against the
aggregate amount of any Earn-Out Payment earned but unpaid to Seller pursuant
to Section 2.06.

  

  

(ii) Parent shall be entitled to determine the amount, if any, of such Loss to
be satisfied from funds then remaining in the General Escrow Account, and
Parent and Agent shall submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to release such funds to the Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(iii) Parent shall be entitled to require Seller to tender to Parent or its
Affiliates, and Parent or its Affiliates shall redeem from such Seller, that
number of shares of the Stock Consideration received hereunder having a value
equal to up to the amount of Losses to be satisfied. Solely for the purposes
of determining the number of shares of Stock Consideration to be tendered and
redeemed, the Stock Consideration shall be deemed to have a value per share
equal to the average trading price of the Parent's common stock over the
previous 20 trading day period (subject to adjustment to reflect any stock
split, stock dividend, or the like with respect to the Stock Consideration
prior to the redemption date).

  

  

(iv) If the remedies under Sections 11.08(a)(i)-(iii) are insufficient to
satisfy such Loss, then Sellers shall pay to such Purchaser Indemnitee any
remaining amount due by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  

  

(b) Within ten Business Days after final resolution pursuant to Section 11.05
of any indemnification claim by any Purchaser Indemnitee hereunder, Parent
shall notify Agent of the manner of satisfaction of such Loss with respect to
each Seller. Within ten Business Days after receipt of the foregoing notice,
each Seller obligated to satisfy a portion of the Loss shall take all actions
necessary to satisfy its indemnification obligation.

  

  

(c) Within ten Business days after final resolution pursuant to Section 11.05
of any indemnification claim by any Seller Indemnitee hereunder pursuant to
which any Seller Indemnitee is entitled to any payment, such payment shall be
made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

  

  

11.09 Escrow Period; Release from Escrow. The funds in the General Escrow
Account, if any, shall become available for distribution to the Seller on the
Release Date. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Release Date, Parent
and Agent shall submit joint written instructions (if necessary) to the Escrow
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Sellers in accordance with each
Seller's Pro Rata Share any funds remaining in the General Escrow Account
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any portion of the
General Escrow Account subject to any pending but unresolved indemnification
claims set forth in a Claim Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to
the Release Date shall only be released by the Escrow Agent and paid to the
Sellers, or released to an Indemnified Party (as appropriate), in each case,
following resolution of each specific indemnification claim involved.

11.10 Certain Matters Relating to Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement:

  

  

(a) The amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party
shall be calculated after giving effect to any insurance proceeds actually
received by such Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses, less any
related costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any
related insurance claims and related increases in insurance premiums or other
chargebacks. If any insurance proceeds are received by an Indemnified Party
with respect to any Losses after the Indemnifying Party has made a payment to
the Indemnified Party with respect thereto, the Indemnified Party shall pay to
the Indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds up to the amount of the
Indemnifying Party's payment to the Indemnified Party less any of the
Indemnified Party's related costs and expenses of recovering such insurance
proceeds, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any related insurance
claims and related increases in insurance premiums or other chargebacks. The
Indemnified Party shall seek to recover insurance proceeds or any other
amounts from third parties related to any Losses for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to this ARTICLE XI only to the extent such Indemnified Party
determines, in its sole discretion, that it is commercially reasonable for it
to do so. Otherwise, no Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to seek to
recover insurance proceeds or any other amounts from third parties in
connection with making an indemnification claim under this ARTICLE XI or
thereafter.

  

  

(b) No Party shall be entitled to make any claim for indemnification under
this Agreement with respect to and to the extent of any specific item that is
included in the determination of the Final Working Capital Amount and accrued
for or reserved for on the Closing Statement.

  

  

ARTICLE XII

  

SELLERS' AGENT

  

  

12.01 Appointment of Sellers' Agent. Agent is hereby irrevocably appointed the
agent and attorney in fact of the Sellers, and the initial Agent hereby
accepts such appointment, to take the actions herein: (a) to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein and to pay such Seller's expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement (whether
occurred on or after the date of this Agreement); (b) to give and receive
notices and communications; (c) to authorize or object to delivery to Parent,
Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnitee of cash from the Working Capital
Escrow Account or the General Escrow Account or in satisfaction of claims by
Parent, Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnitee and to distribute any
funds payable by Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement that are for the
benefit of Sellers which are released from the Working Capital Escrow Account
and the General Escrow Account for the benefit of the Sellers pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement; (d) to deduct and/or hold back any funds that
may be payable to any Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement in order to pay any amount that may be payable by such Seller
hereunder, in each case on a basis consistent with their Pro Rata Share; (e)
to make any determinations, agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, any matters contemplated by this Agreement, including in
connection with the determination or the adjustment of, or any other matter
pertaining to, the Purchase Price or any Earn-Out Payment except for any
breach by a Seller hereunder for which recovery sought may be beyond the
General Escrow Amount; (f) to assert any claim to recover Losses of Sellers or
other Seller Indemnitees, including claims related to Pre-Closing Taxes
pursuant to ARTICLE X or for indemnification pursuant to ARTICLE XI; (g) to
execute and deliver on behalf of such Seller any amendment or waiver to the
terms of this Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement; (h) to retain funds
for reasonably anticipated expenses and liabilities and to disburse funds to
third parties for expenses and liabilities; (i) to take all actions necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of Agent for the accomplishment of the
foregoing; and (j) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights
which such Seller, or any or all of the Sellers collectively, are permitted or
required to do or exercise under this agreement, provided that such Seller
(and not Agent) shall control any and all claims against such Seller for
breaches of such Seller's representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE
III or any covenant of such Seller hereunder if not completely covered by the
General Escrow Amount (and, as applicable, any Earn-Out Payment). A decision,
act, consent or instruction of Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Seller, and
the Escrow Agent, Parent and Purchaser may rely upon any decision, act,
consent or instruction of Agent as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each and every such Seller. The Escrow Agent, Parent and
Purchaser are hereby irrevocably relieved from any Liability to any Person for
any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of Agent. All such actions shall be deemed to be facts
ascertainable outside this Agreement and shall be binding on the Sellers as a
matter of contract Law. This appointment of agency and this power of attorney
is coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable and will not be terminated
by any Seller or by operation of Law. A new Agent may be designated by the
holders at Closing of a majority in interest of the Purchased Units upon not
less than ten days' prior written notice to Parent. No bond shall be required
of Agent, and Agent shall receive no compensation for its services from
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates after the Closing. Notices or
communications to or from Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Sellers. Each Seller hereby agrees to receive correspondence from Agent,
including by e-mail transmission to any e-mail address set forth in the notice
provisions of this Agreement or subsequently provided to Agent by such Seller.

12.02 Liability of Agent. Agent shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Sellers shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold the Agent harmless against any loss,
Liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder.

  

  

12.03 Reimbursement of Expenses; Payment. Upon the release of the General
Escrow Amount, Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable
expenses incurred by him or it in connection with fulfilling his or its duties
as set forth in this Agreement from the General Escrow Account, but only to
the extent of the General Escrow Amount that remains available for
distribution after satisfaction of all obligations to Purchaser Indemnitees
(including any potential obligations and pending claims set forth in any Claim
Certificate) pursuant to ARTICLE XI hereof.

  

  

ARTICLE XIII

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

13.01 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and the Indemnified Parties pursuant to
ARTICLE XI; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debt Financing
Sources (and their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and Representatives) are
express third party beneficiaries of this Section 13.01, Section 13.04,
Section 13.06(a), Section 13.07 and Section 13.16.

  

  

13.02 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including
the documents and schedules referred to herein and therein) constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, that

13.03 Succession and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of any Seller under this Agreement may be
assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
by any Seller without the prior written consent of Parent, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that each of the Purchaser and Parent may assign its rights hereunder to the
Debt Financing Sources, provided that such assignment shall not relieve
Purchaser and Parent of their respective obligations hereunder.

  

  

13.04 Amendments and Waivers. Prior to the Closing, no amendment, modification
or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by each Seller, Company, and Parent;
provided, however, that any waiver by a Party of a closing condition for its
benefit pursuant to Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 shall only require a writing
signed by such Party. None of Section 13.01, this Section 13.04, Section
13.04, Section 13.06(a), Section 13.07 and Section 13.16 shall be amended,
modified, changed or waived in any way that would be adverse to the Debt
Financing Sources unless such amendment or modification shall have been
consented to in writing by the Debt Financing Sources. After the Closing, no
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Agent, Parent and
Purchaser. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  

  

13.05 Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing. Any notice, request, demand,
claim, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given: (a) when
delivered, if personally delivered; (b) when receipt is confirmed if faxed

13.06 GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION.

  

  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF
LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY
JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. SUBJECT TO SECTION 13.06(B),
THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY
UNITED STATES FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ILLINOIS FOR ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND WAIVE
ANY CLAIM THAT THIS VENUE IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

  

  

(b) Except for disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm pursuant to
Sections 2.04(c) and 2.06(d), all disputes relating to this Agreement arising
after the Closing Date shall be submitted to binding arbitration before the
American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or any other individual or
organization on which the Parties agree in writing. Notwithstanding the above,
any Party may file with an appropriate state or federal court a claim for
injunctive relief in any case where the filing party seeks provisional
injunctive relief or where permanent injunctive relief is not available in
arbitration. The filing of a claim for injunctive relief in state or federal
court shall not allow either party to raise any other claim outside of
arbitration. It is understood that all Parties are hereby waiving the right to
a jury trial. The arbitration shall be initiated in Chicago Illinois or New
York, New York, or such other venue as the Parties may agree, and shall be
administered by AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules before a single
arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the Parties hereto. If the Parties cannot
agree on a single arbitrator, then an arbitrator shall be selected in
accordance with the rules of AAA. Each Party shall be entitled to take three
depositions, engage in document discovery, propound interrogatory requests and
to take any other discovery as is permitted by the arbitrator. In determining
the extent of discovery, the arbitrator shall exercise discretion. The
arbitrator shall render an award which conforms to the facts, as supported by
competent evidence (except that the arbitrator may accept written declarations
under penalty of perjury, in addition to live testimony), and the law as it
would be applied by a court sitting in the State of New York or such other
jurisdiction as the Parties may agree. The cost of arbitration shall be borne
equally by the Parties; however, the arbitrator shall have the power, in his
discretion, to award some or all of the costs of arbitration and reasonable
attorneys' fees to the prevailing Party. Any Party may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for entry of judgment on the arbitration award.

13.07 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE
ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER ARISING IN
CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR
INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND/OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER.

  

  

13.08 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

  

  

13.09 Remedies. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that each of the
Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
Sections 6.06 or 7.03 of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of the provisions of Sections 6.06 or 7.03 of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically Sections 6.06 or 7.03 of this Agreement
and the terms and provisions thereof in any action instituted in any court of
the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties
and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled,
at law or in equity. Each Party hereby agrees that should any other Party
institute any action or proceeding for injunctive or similar equitable relief
to enforce the provisions of Sections 6.06 or 7.03, such Party waives and
agrees not to assert the claims or defenses that the other Party has an
adequate remedy at law or that such Party will not suffer irreparable damage.
All remedies hereunder shall be cumulative.

  

  

13.10 Construction. The Parties have jointly participated in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumptions or burdens of proof shall
arise favoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions
of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party
has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant. The recitals, annexes, exhibits, schedules and other
attachments hereto identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

  

  

13.11 Interpretation. (a) Any capitalized terms used in any schedule or
exhibit attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the
meanings set forth in this Agreement, (b) whenever required by the context,
any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereof," "hereto" and "hereunder" and terms of similar import are references
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement; (d) section, clause, schedule and exhibit references contained in
this Agreement are references to sections, clauses, schedules and exhibits in
or to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified; (e) the terms "includes,"
"including" and similar terms shall be deemed to mean "including, without
limitation,"; (f) the use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive, unless
expressly indicated otherwise; (g) reference to any Person includes such
Person's successors and assigns to the extent such successors and assigns are
permitted by the terms of any applicable agreement, and reference to a Person
in a particular capacity excludes such Person in any other capacity or
individually; (h) reference to any agreement (including this Agreement),
document or instrument shall mean such agreement, document or instrument as
amended, modified or supplemented and in effect from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof and, if applicable, the terms hereof; and
(i) for the avoidance of doubt, any subtraction of a negative number or amount
hereunder shall be equal to the addition of the absolute value of such
negative number or amount.

13.12 Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

13.13 Expenses. Seller or the Company (prior to the Closing) on the one hand,
and Parent, Purchaser or the Company (after the Closing) on the other hand
shall pay all of their own expenses (including attorneys' and accountants'
fees and expenses) in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the
performance of the Parties' respective obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

  

  

13.14 Electronic Delivery; Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement and each other agreement or instrument entered into in connection
herewith and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by
means of facsimile or other electronic transmission (including .pdf files),
shall be treated in all manner and respects and for all purposes as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No Party to any such agreement or instrument shall raise
the use of facsimile or other electronic transmission to deliver a signature
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile or other electronic transmission as
a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each such Party
forever waives any such defense.

  

  

13.15 Provisions Respecting Legal Representation. Each of Parties hereto
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that Ungaretti and Harris LLP has served as
counsel to the Company, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, in
connection with negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
Ungaretti and Harris LLP (or any successor thereof) may serve as counsel to the
Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers in connection with any litigation,
claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation, and each of the Parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such Parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation.

contained in this Agreement, each of the Parties: (i) agrees that it will not
bring or support any Person in any action, suit, Proceeding, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in

contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to any documents related thereto or
hereto or the performance thereof or hereof or the financings contemplated by
any such debt commitment letter, in any forum other than the federal and New
York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New
York (which shall be the exclusive venue for any such action, suit,
proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party action) and
waives any object any of them may have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action, suit,
Proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity in any such court; (ii)
agrees that, all action, suit, Proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim

Purchaser or its Affiliates by the Debt Financing Sources or any of the
agreements or documents relating to or entered into in connection with such
debt financing or the performance of any services thereunder or the
performance thereof, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another
jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise)
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to any debt
financing provided by the Debt Financing Sources to the Company, Purchaser or
its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (A) none of the Agent, the Sellers, the Company and any of their
respective employees, officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates shall
have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source (or such Debt
Financing Source's Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, officers,
