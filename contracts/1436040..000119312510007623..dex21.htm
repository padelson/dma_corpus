iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 18, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among TYCO INTERNATIONAL LTD., a corporation
limited by shares ( _Aktiengesellschaft_ ) organized under the laws of
Switzerland (" _Parent_ "), BARRICADE MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation
and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), BRINKS
HOME SECURITY HOLDINGS, INC., a Virginia corporation (the " _Company_ "), and,
solely for purposes of _Sections 9.8_ , _9.9(c)_ and _9.10_ , ADT
SECURITY SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _ADT Security Services_ "). Unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise, capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in  _Section
9.1_.

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously, by resolutions duly adopted at a meeting duly called and held,
(i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the
Company Shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement
with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the Merger of the Company with and
into Merger Sub, in accordance with the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the "
_VSCA_ ") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii)
adopted and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with the VSCA (including for purposes of Sections 13.1-725.1 
13.1-727.1 of the VSCA) and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein and approved the Merger, (iii) directed that the Company submit
the approval of this Agreement and the Merger to a vote at a meeting of the
Company Shareholders (subject to the terms and conditions hereof), (iv)
resolved that the Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the
Company Shareholders required to approve this Agreement and the Merger and (v)
recommended that the Company Shareholders approve this Agreement, the Merger,
and the Plan (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ");

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each approved
and declared it advisable for each such entity to enter into this Agreement
providing for the Merger in accordance with the VSCA and the DGCL, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ ") and (ii) this Agreement
shall constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the VSCA and the DGCL, and in reliance upon the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the Company will merge
with and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time and the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall thereupon cease (the " _Merger_ "). Merger Sub
shall be the surviving corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Entity_ ") and shall continue to   be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth
in _Section 1.3_ and _Section 1.4_. The effect of the Merger will be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the VSCA, the DGCL, and the terms of
this Agreement.

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
parties hereto will (a) file articles of merger, in customary form meeting
the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA including setting forth the
plan of merger that meets the requirements of Section 13.1-716 of the VSCA
(the " _Plan_ "), substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " _Articles of Merger_ "), with the State Corporation Commission of the
Commonwealth of Virginia (the " _SCC_ "), (b) duly make all other filings
and recordings required by the VSCA in order to effectuate the Merger, (c)
file a certificate of merger in customary form (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware meeting
the applicable requirements of the DGCL, and (d) duly make all other filings
and recordings required by the DGCL in order to effectuate the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective upon (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the issuance of a
certificate of merger by the SCC with respect to the Merger or (ii) at such
later date and time as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing
and specified in the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of Merger. The
date and time the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_."

Section 1.3 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub
shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as is set forth on _Exhibit
B_ annexed hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance
with its terms and as provided by Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub shall be amended so as to
read in its entirety in the form as is set forth in _Exhibit C_ annexed
hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Entity and as provided by Law.

Section 1.4 _Officers and Directors_. The officers and directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity immediately following the Effective Time,
each to serve as an officer or director in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity.

Section 1.5 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Fulbright and
Jaworski L.L.P., 2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 2800, Dallas, Texas, 75201 at 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the parties, and in
any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on
which the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_  (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) have
been satisfied or waived or at such other place, time and date as the parties
hereto may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.6 _Alternative Merger Structure_. If a decrease in the trading
price of Parent Shares results in the aggregate share consideration to be
received by the Company Shareholders on the Closing Date pursuant to _Section
2.1_ representing less than 40.0% of the value of the aggregate Merger 



 

2 Consideration, the requirement to obtain the opinions required by _Sections
7.2(c)_ and _7.3(c)_  shall be waived and the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement shall be restructured such that (a) Merger Sub or a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, (b) the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub or the Subsidiary of Merger Sub,
as applicable, shall cease, and (c) the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge
that the transaction as restructured by this  _Section 1.6_ may not qualify
as a tax-free reorganization under the Code.

ARTICLE II

_CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of this _Article II_ ,
each share of common stock of the Company, having no par value (" _Company
Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(e)_), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any equity holder thereof, be
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive, subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.1(g)_, a
combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been effectively
made and not revoked pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (each, a " _Mixed
Consideration Electing Share_ ") and each Non-Electing Company Share shall be
converted into the right to receive (which consideration combination shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Mixed Consideration_ ") (A) $12.75 per
share in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ ") and
(B) a fraction of a validly issued, fully paid in and nonassessable Parent
Share (the " _Mixed Election Per Share Equity Consideration_ ") equal to the
quotient determined by dividing $29.75 by the Parent Share Value (as may be
adjusted pursuant to the proviso in this sentence) and rounding to the
nearest ten-thousandth of a share; _provided_ , _that_ if the Parent Share
Value is equal to or greater than $40.29, the Parent Share Value shall be
$40.29 and if the Parent Share Value is equal to or less than $32.97, then the
Parent Share Value shall be $32.97 (such Parent Share Value, as adjusted, the
" _Adjusted Parent Share Value_ ");

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (each, a " _Cash Electing Company Share_ ") shall
be converted, subject to _Section 2.1(b)_, and _Section 2.1(g)_, into the
right to receive $42.50 in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash
Election Consideration_ "); and

(iii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is properly made and not
revoked pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (each, a " _Stock Electing Company Share_
") shall be converted (subject to  _Section 2.1(g)_), into the right to
receive a number of validly issued, fully paid in and nonassessable Parent
Shares (together with any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.3_, the " _Stock Consideration_ ") equal to, 



 

3  rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, the quotient determined by
dividing $42.50 by either (A) the Parent Share Value, or (B) the Adjusted
Parent Share Value (as calculated in _Section 2.1(a)(i)_) _if and only if_
the Parent Share Value is (1) equal to or greater than $40.29 or (2) equal to
or less than $32.97.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) (1) the product of the number of
Cash Electing Company Shares multiplied by the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration (such amount, the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") plus (2) the
product of the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Shares multiplied by the
Per Share Cash Consideration (clause (1) and (2) together, the " _Aggregate
Elected Cash Consideration_ ") exceeds (B) the Available Cash Amount (such
amount by which (A) exceeds (B), the " _Cash Oversubscription Amount_
"), then each Cash Electing Company Share shall be converted into a right to
receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to (a) the Cash
Election Amount less the Cash Oversubscription Amount, divided by (b) the
number of Cash Electing Company Shares (such amount, the " _Adjusted Per
Share Cash Election Amount_ ") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid
in and nonassessable Parent Shares, rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of
a share, equal to (a) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, less the
Adjusted Per Share Cash Election Amount, divided by (b) (i) the Parent Share
Value or (ii) the Adjusted Parent Share Value (as calculated in  _Section
2.1(a)(i)_) _if and only if_ the Parent Share Value is (1) equal to or greater
than $40.29 or (2) equal to or less than $32.97.

(c) Notwithstanding the definition of Available Cash Amount, in the event
there is a Cash Oversubscription Amount as calculated pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_, Parent shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to increase the
amount of the Available Cash Amount to any amount up to and including the
amount of the Aggregate Elected Cash Consideration;  _provided_ , _that_
Parent may not increase the Available Cash Amount to an amount that, in the
opinion of counsel to Parent or counsel to the Company, would cause either of
such counsel to be unable to render its opinion described in  _Section
7.2(c)_ and _Section 7.3(c)_, respectively, and nothing in this _Section
2.1(c)_ shall affect the consideration with respect to a Stock Electing
Company Share.

(d) [ _Reserved._ ]

(e) From and after the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock held
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Cancelled
Shares_ ") shall automatically (i) cease to be outstanding, (ii) be canceled
and retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and (iii) cease to
exist.

(f) All shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time and
converted into Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1_
(collectively, the " _Shares_ "), shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and each certificate previously representing any such Shares (a "
_Certificate_ ") and non-certificated Shares represented by a book entry (the
" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent the right to receive, with
respect to each underlying Share, (i) the consideration to which such holder
may be entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.1_, (ii) any dividends and other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.4(g)_ and (iii) any cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional Parent Share in accordance with _Section
2.3_.

(g) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding capital stock of Parent or
the outstanding common stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split 



 

4  (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange, merger,
consolidation or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar
transaction or event, the Merger Consideration, the exchange ratios and any
other similarly dependent items described herein, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event,
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration, the applicable exchange ratio or other dependent item, as
applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this sentence.

(h) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding and shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Entity.

Section 2.2 _Election Procedures_.

(a) At the time of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to holders of
record of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Shareholders
Meeting (such date, the " _Mailing Date_ "), an election form and other
appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock, or Book-Entry
Shares, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, respectively, to the Exchange Agent, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) in such form as Parent
and the Company shall reasonably agree (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be
mailed to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the
record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting.

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the Beneficial Owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder makes a Cash Election, (ii) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
make a Stock Election, or (iii) the number of shares of such holders Company
Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to make a Mixed
Election. Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent
has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before
5:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day that is four (4) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly announced by
Parent as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date) (or such other time and date as the
Company and Parent shall agree in writing) (the " _Election Deadline_ ")
shall be deemed to be " _Non-Electing Company Shares_ ". If the Effective
Time is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly
delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent shall promptly announce any such
delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(c) Parent shall make Election Forms available as may reasonably be requested
from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or Beneficial Owners) of
Company Common Stock between the record date for the Company Shareholders
Meeting and the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to
the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as
specified herein and as specified in any agreement with the Exchange Agent.



 

5 (d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. An Election
Form shall be deemed properly completed only (i) if accompanied by one or
more Certificates duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for
transfer on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such Election Form from a firm
that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under
the Exchange Act) and/or (ii) upon receipt of an "agents message" by the
Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer of Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request, collectively
representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form,
together with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election
Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting
such Election Form, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become Non-Electing Company Shares and Parent shall cause
the Certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock or Book-
Entry Shares to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting
the Election Form upon such revocation or written request to that effect from
the holder who submitted the Election Form; _provided_ , _that_ a subsequent
election may be made with respect to any or all of such shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.2_. In addition, all Cash
Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically be revoked
and all Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be
promptly returned without charge if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_ of this Agreement.

(e) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent, in consultation with both Parent and the Company, shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent or the Company or
the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

Section 2.3 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Shares or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, no dividends or other distributions of
Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests, including any
fractional share interests resulting pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of such fractional share
interests, Parent shall pay to each holder of a Certificate (upon surrender
thereof as provided in this _Article II_ ) or Book-Entry Share an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (y) the fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares) would
otherwise be entitled by (z) the Parent Share Value or Adjusted Parent Share
Value, as applicable.

Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for
the Merger Consideration. Parent shall pay all costs, fees, and
expenses incurred in connection with the retention and engagement 



 

6  of the Exchange Agent. In connection with the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall enter into an exchange agent and nominee agreement with the Exchange
Agent, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, setting forth the
procedures to be used in accomplishing the deliveries and other actions
contemplated by this _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.2_.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than any holder which has previously
and properly surrendered all of its Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.2_) (each, an " _Electing Shareholder_ "), a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (1) issue and
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent to be held in trust
for the holders of Company Common Stock, evidence of shares in book-entry form
in compliance with the Parents articles of association and all applicable
Laws, representing Parent Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ in
exchange for outstanding Company Common Stock for which a Stock Election or
Mixed Election (to the extent such consideration is payable in Parent Shares)
has been made and for Non-Electing Company Shares (to the extent such
consideration is payable in Parent Shares) and an amount of cash representing
the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and (2)
deposit with the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in amounts
that are sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.3_, and to make any dividends or other distributions pursuant to 
_Section 2.4(g)_, in each case, to be paid in respect of the Certificates and
the Book-Entry Shares by holders thereof who have properly delivered to the
Exchange Agent their Company Common Stock. Any cash and Parent Shares
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ _._ " The Exchange Agent shall, subject to the terms of the
exchange agent and nominee agreement entered into with Parent, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.1_,
_Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.3_ out of the Exchange Fund. Until used for
that purpose, the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by
the Exchange Agent in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or short-term obligations of an agency of the United States
of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or in
deposit accounts, short-term certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances
of, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with commercial banks which
have capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of the banks which are then
publicly available at the SEC or otherwise); _provided_ , _that_ no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
former Company Shareholders entitled to receive such consideration or cash in
lieu of fractional interests, and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Entity to promptly provide, additional cash funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the former Company Shareholders in the
amount of any such losses. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than the foregoing.

(d) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon (i) with respect to any
Electing Shareholder, 



 

7  completion of the calculations required by _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section
2.1(b)_ or (ii) with respect to any holder that is not an Electing
Shareholder, surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent together with the letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) one or more Parent Shares which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form and which shall represent, in the aggregate,
the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to
any cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this  _Article
II_ , consisting of the cash consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of Company Common Stock, as the case may be,
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and any dividends and other distributions pursuant
to _Section 2.4(g)_, in each case, less any required withholding taxes. The
Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as reasonably practicable after
receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares
in accordance with _Article II_ hereof or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until
so surrendered, each such Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall, from and
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, the issuance or payment of which (including any
cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in
full of all rights pertaining to shares of Company Common Stock converted in
the Merger.

(e) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason
of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock thereafter. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, each such share shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for in this _Article II_
in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of any share of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that has not
been registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock shall
be paid to the transferee of such share if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
that previously represented such share is presented to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry 



 

8  Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law.

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares issued
in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered
as provided in this _Section 2.4_. Following such surrender, subject to the
effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the record holder of the Parent Shares, if any, issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of any such Parent Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions
in respect of Parent Shares, all Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

Section 2.5 _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Company Shareholders for twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity or, if so directed by
the Surviving Entity, to Parent. Any Company Shareholders who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment of the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock formerly held by
such shareholder as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest
thereon, and Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be responsible with
respect to such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company,
Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws.

Section 2.6 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required, the posting by the holder of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration such
holder has a right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_.

Section 2.7 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Brinks Home Security
Holdings, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan and the Brinks Home Security
Holdings, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ") that is unexpired and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Company Stock Options_ "), other than the 2010
Company Stock Options, shall vest and become fully exercisable, whether or
not then vested or subject to any performance condition or other restriction.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, each Company Stock Option shall be converted
into an option to purchase the number of Parent Shares equal to the product of
(x) the Stock Award Conversion Fraction, and (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Company Stock Option (rounded down to
the nearest whole share and assuming each Company Stock Option was otherwise
vested and fully exercisable), at an exercise 



 

9  price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the exercise price
for each such share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Stock Option
divided by the Stock Award Conversion Fraction, which shall, however,
correspond at least to the nominal value of a Parent Share at the time of
exercise. The other terms of each such Company Stock Option shall continue to
apply in accordance with their terms (substituting references to the Company
to references to Parent, where appropriate), _provided_ , _however_ , _that_
Parent shall treat each Company Stock Option, other than the 2010 Company
Stock Options, as fully vested and immediately exercisable. Each
Company Stock Option converted pursuant to the terms of this _Section
2.7(a)_ shall be referred to as a " _Parent Exchange Option_." Parent shall
reserve for issuance the number of Parent Shares subject to Parent
Exchange Options pursuant to this _Section 2.7(a)_. For purposes of this
_Section 2.7(a)_, the " _Stock Award Conversion Fraction_ " shall mean (i)
$42.50 divided by (ii) (A) the Parent Share Value or (B) the Adjusted Parent
Share Value (as calculated in _Section 2.1(a)(i)_) _if and only if_ the
Parent Share Value is (1) equal to or greater than $40.29 or (2) equal to or
less than $32.97, subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.1(g)_.
The adjustments provided herein with respect to any Company Stock Options that
are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall be,
and are intended to be, effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code. The number of shares subject to any Parent Exchange Option
and the exercise price per share of such Parent Exchange Option shall be
determined in a manner which would not result in the conversion of Company
Stock Options into Parent Exchange Options being treated as a new grant of
stock options under Section 409A of the Code, and the Company and Parent shall
agree upon any adjustments to this _Section 2.7(a)_ necessary to avoid such
new grant of stock options ( _provided, that_ in any event each Parent
Exchange Option shall have an exercise price corresponding to at least the
nominal value of a Parent Share at the time of exercise).

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding right to receive shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
a stock unit award granted under any Company Stock Plan that is subject to any
performance condition or other restrictions (each, a " _Company Restricted
Stock Unit_ "), which has not lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become fully vested. Such Company Restricted Stock Units shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into a restricted share unit with respect to the number Parent
Shares that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Stock Award Conversion Fraction (rounded to the
nearest whole share) (a " _Parent Exchange Restricted Stock Unit_ "), and
otherwise on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such Company
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time. The obligations
in respect of the Parent Exchange Restricted Stock Units shall be payable or
distributable in accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or
arrangement relating to such Parent Exchange Restricted Stock Units.

(c) _Company Deferred Units_. At the Effective Time, each right under the
Company Benefit Plans (other than any 401(k) Plan) of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units), including the
deferred Company share units held in the participant accounts under the
Brinks Home Security Holdings, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan, the
Brinks Home Security Holdings, Inc. Directors Stock Accumulation Plan and
the Brinks Home Security Holdings, Inc. Key Employees Deferred Compensation
Program (such Company Benefit Plans, the " _Company Deferred Compensation
Plans_ " and such rights, collectively referred to herein, as the " _Company
Deferred Units_ ") shall convert into one of the following, at Parents
election: (i) a right to receive a number of Parent Shares equal to (A) the
number of 



 

10  shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Deferred Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Stock Award
Conversion Fraction (as so adjusted, the " _Adjusted Deferred Units_ ") or
(ii) a right to receive an account under the Tyco Supplemental Savings and
Retirement Plan (the " _Parent Retirement Plan_ ") with a notional balance
equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Deferred Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
(ii) $42.50 (" _Deferred Compensation Account_ "). Such Adjusted
Deferred Unit or Deferred Compensation Account shall be payable or
distributable in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Deferred
Compensation Plan, with any Adjusted Deferred Unit otherwise governed by the
Company Deferred Compensation Plan and any Deferred Compensation Account
otherwise governed by the Parent Retirement Plan.

(d) Before the Closing, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
of the Company Board administering the Company Stock Plans) shall take all
actions necessary, (including the adoption of resolutions) to effectuate the
treatment of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and
Company Deferred Units set forth in _Sections 2.7(a)_ through _(c)_.

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the obligations and succeed
to the rights of Company under the Company Stock Plans and the Company
Deferred Compensation Plans with respect to the Company Stock Options (as
converted into Parent Exchange Options), the Company Restricted Stock Units
(as converted into Parent Exchange Restricted Stock Units), and the Company
Deferred Units (as converted into Adjusted Deferred Units). From and after
the Effective Time, all references to Company (other than any references
relating to a "change in control" of Company) in each Company Stock Plan and
each Company Deferred Compensation Plan and in each agreement evidencing any
award of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company
Deferred Units, shall be deemed to refer to Parent, unless Parent in good
faith determines otherwise.

(f) Except as otherwise contemplated by this _Section 2.7_ and except to the
extent required under the respective terms of the Company Stock Options, all
restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to Company
Stock Options awarded under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program
or arrangement of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the
extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed,
shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such Company Stock
Options after giving effect to the Merger and the assumption by Parent as
set forth above.

Section 2.8 _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments made pursuant to
this Agreement (including pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.7_) such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent are required
to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery and payment under the
Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the holder of shares of Company
Common Stock and such other Persons, as applicable, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent.

delay the ability of the parties to obtain any necessary approvals of any
Governmental Entity required for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or

(g) take, agree in writing to take, or authorize any of the actions described
in clauses (a) through (f) above.

this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company shall not, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors and
employees to not, and shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries accountants, legal counsel,

indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly
encourage any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries regarding the submission of
any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations

shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (A) taking and
disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a Third Party contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or making a
statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or (B) making any
disclosure to the Company Shareholders if the Company Board has determined,
in 



 

41  good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
make any such disclosure is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, _provided_ , _that_  (1) compliance with such rules shall in
no way limit Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ hereof and payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.3(c)_ or  _Section 8.3(d)_ and (2) in no event shall the Company or the

withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation or make or cause to be made through the Companys or the
Company Subsidiaries Representatives any public statement proposing or
announcing an intention to withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub the Company Board Recommendation (any such action, a " _Change
in Recommendation_ ") (it being understood that any "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act shall not be deemed a Change in Recommendation). The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return
or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_, at any
time from the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, if the Company has received from any Third Party a bona
fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that was
not solicited in violation of and did not otherwise result from a breach of
this _Section 5.3_, (i) the Company may contact such Third Party or its
advisors for the purpose of clarifying such Takeover Proposal and the material
terms and conditions thereof to the extent required to determine whether such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company may negotiate the terms of, and enter into, a
confidentiality agreement with terms and conditions no less restrictive on
such Third Party as the Confidentiality Agreement is on Parent and its
Affiliates (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (iii) the
Company may furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets
to such Third Party pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
_provided, that_ all such information (to the extent not previously provided
to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Third Party, and may negotiate
and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party
concerning such Takeover Proposal, if such Third Party has submitted a
Superior Proposal, or a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
counsel) is reasonably likely to constitute or lead to a Superior Proposal, if
in connection with the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), (A) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders, and (B) prior to taking such
action, the Company shall provide written notice thereof to Parent.

(c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt)
advise Parent in writing of the receipt by the Company of any Takeover
Proposal after the date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions
of any such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto) and
the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company will
keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status and
details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any such
Takeover Proposal.



 

42 (d) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
set forth below:

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide, written proposal by a Third Party
that, if consummated, would result in such Third Party (or its equityholders)
owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger
or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all
or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (i) which the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) to be more
favorable to the Company Shareholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to any
changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such offer or otherwise) and (ii) which is fully financed (or
reasonably capable of being fully financed) with respect to the cash
consideration set forth in the proposal, and which, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, is otherwise reasonably likely to be consummated on the
terms set forth in the proposal, taking into consideration (with respect to
both subsections (i) and (ii) hereof) all financial, regulatory, legal, timing
and other aspects of such proposal (including any break-up fee and conditions
to consummation).

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (including any proposal
or offer from or to the Company Shareholders), whether in writing or
otherwise, from a Third Party related to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of (i) assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the
Company), rights or properties that constitute 10% or more of the revenues,
net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or
(ii) 10% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (or voting power related thereto) (or that would result in
such Third Party (or its equityholders) owning 10% or more of any class of
equity securities of any resulting parent company of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in any such transaction (or voting power related
thereto)), in either case, whether pursuant to a merger, consolidation or
other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets,
tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, issuance or amendment of
securities, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction and
whether pursuant to a single transaction or a series of related transactions.

" _Third Party_ " means any Person or group other than Parent, Merger Sub or
any Affiliate thereof.

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3(e)_, neither the Company nor the
Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall (i) effect a Change in
Recommendation (it being understood that any "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act shall not be deemed a Change in Recommendation), or (ii) subject
to the next sentence of this _Section 5.3(e)_, approve, adopt or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, joint venture agreement,
acquisition or merger agreement or other similar agreement constituting a
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement permitted pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_). Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and subject to compliance with 
_Section 5.3(f)_, (A) effect a Change in Recommendation in response to a
material development or material change in circumstances occurring or arising
after the date hereof with respect to the Company that (1) is materially
and disproportionately more favorable to the recurring financial condition
and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to other businesses operating in the same industry (including
Parents ADT business) and (2) was neither known to the Company Board nor
reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof (and not relating to
any Takeover Proposal, any development or change relating to Parent (including
any decline in the trading price of Parent Shares), clearance of the 



 

43  Merger under the HSR Act, or any introduction into the marketplace of new or
modified products or services by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries)
(such material development or change in circumstances, an " _Intervening
Event_ _"_ ) if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties to the Company
Shareholders and (B) take any of the foregoing actions set forth in clauses
(i) and (ii) of this _Section 5.3(e) _in response to a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that the Company
Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was not
solicited in violation of this  _Section 5.3_ if the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that,
in light of such Superior Proposal, failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties to the Company
Shareholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to clause (B) above
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_
or enter into any such agreement, and any such purported termination or
executed agreement shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company
(x) pays to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_
prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination and (y) has
complied in all material respects with its obligations set forth in _Section
5.3(f)_. Any Change in Recommendation shall not change the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board in any respect,
including any change that would have the effect of causing any state corporate
takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company Board shall
not be entitled to effect a Change in Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ unless:

(i) the Company has provided to Parent three (3) Business Days prior written
notice (a " _Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board is prepared to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor;

(ii) with respect to a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board has determined
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company has provided or made available
to Parent all information concerning its business, properties or assets
delivered or made available to the Third Party making such Takeover Proposal
that the Company Board has determined constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

(iii) (A) (1) with respect to a Takeover Proposal that the Board has
determined constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Notice includes a description
of the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
has determined constitutes a Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third
Party making the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any material amendment to any other material term of
any such Takeover Proposal shall require a new Notice and a new three (3)
Business Day period) and (2) with respect to a Change in Recommendation in
response to an Intervening Event, the Company has provided to Parent in the
Notice a reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event; (B) during
such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company
provides an opportunity for Parent to propose amendments to this Agreement in
such a manner that (1) with respect to a Takeover Proposal, such Takeover
Proposal that was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a
Superior Proposal and (2) with respect to an Intervening Event, such
Intervening Event no longer necessitates a Change in 



 

44  Recommendation; and (C) at 11:59 p.m., Dallas Texas time, at the end of such
three (3) Business Day period, (1) with respect to a Takeover Proposal which
the Company Board has determined constitutes a Superior Proposal, such
Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn and the Company Board has reasonably
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and
financial advisors) that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the financial and other
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in a binding irrevocable written
offer following the Notice and as a result of the negotiations between Parent
and the Company pursuant to this clause (B)), and (2) in the case of an
Intervening Event, such Intervening Event continues to necessitate a Change in
Recommendation (taking into account any changes to the financial and
other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in a binding irrevocable
written offer following the Notice and as a result of the negotiations between
Parent and the Company pursuant to this clause (B)).

(g) Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with,
_Section 8.1_, the obligation of the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)_
(subject to _Section 6.1(d)_) to establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and to hold a
vote of the Company Shareholders on the approval of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to
hold the Company Shareholders Meeting if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_.

ARTICLE VI

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

Section 6.1 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
Company Shareholder Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare (with Parents reasonable cooperation) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC the Form S-4. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any written or oral comments from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or any related
matters. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included within the Form S-4
filed with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
and to maintain such effectiveness for as long as necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable after such filing. Parent shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities or "blue
sky" laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger as
contemplated by this Agreement and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock and rights
to acquire Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action and in connection with the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any event occurs or information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set 



 

45  forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company
Shareholders.

(b) In addition to their obligations pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_, Parent and
the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky"
laws and Regulations thereunder and provide each other with copies of any
such filings. Parent and the Company shall advise the other party, promptly
after receipt of notice thereof, of (and provide copies of any notices or
communications with respect to) the time of the effectiveness of the Form
S-4, the filing of any supplement or amendment thereto, the issuance of any
stop order relating thereto, the suspension of the qualification of Parent
Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendment to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4, comments thereon from the SECs
staff and each partys responses thereto or request of the SEC or its staff
for additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be filed without the approval of
each of Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) The Company shall (i) take all action in accordance with the federal
securities laws, the VSCA, the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws
necessary to convene a special meeting of the Company Shareholders (the "
_Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company
Shareholder Approval (and any authority needed to adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders Meeting) following (x) the date the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act and (y) the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act; _provided that _ no action is pending
by any Governmental Entity seeking to enjoin or prevent the consummation of
the Merger under Antitrust Law (such date, the " _Antitrust Clearance Date_
"), and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval (except to the extent the Company has effected a Change
in Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.3_) and, subject to _Section
5.3_, include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed in definitive form to the Company
Shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act and to convene the Company Shareholders
Meeting promptly after the Antitrust Clearance Date.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
subject to the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ , the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders
Meeting solely (i) to ensure that the Company Shareholders are provided with
any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus sufficiently in
advance of the vote to be held at the Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) if
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to vote in favor of a proposal to approve and adopt this
Agreement or to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, or (iii) from time to time, as may be
necessary, to a date or dates that occur subsequent to the Antitrust Clearance
Date if the Antitrust Clearance Date has not occurred on the date that is five
(5) Business Days prior to the applicable scheduled date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting.



 

46 Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) (i) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, including under applicable
Antitrust Law, and (ii) subject to (A) restrictions imposed upon the Company
and any Company Subsidiary by any agreement of confidentiality with any
Person, and (B) the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2009,
between the Company and Tyco International Management Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the Company shall provide to Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and after
reasonable prior notice, during the period prior to the Closing Date, to the
officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including Tax Returns), and such other
information as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses,
financial conditions and operations. Parent and its Representatives shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries which may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would, based on the advice of
outside counsel, cause the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries to be inapplicable or violate, in any material respect, any Law
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each party shall hold, and shall cause its respective Representatives to
hold, any confidential or nonpublic information in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ shall affect any of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement of any party or any condition
of the parties.

Section 6.3 _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, to
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all Legal
Requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to remove any restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and,
subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
obtain (and cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent,
authorization, Permit, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity which is required to be obtained by Parent or the
Company, respectively, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and promptly prepare and file
all necessary documentation, and to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings (including any notification required by the HSR Act), to
obtain as promptly as practicable all Permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations of all Governmental Entities, and the expiry or termination of
all applicable waiting periods, which are necessary or advisable to consummate
the Merger and 



 

47  the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of
all Permits and consents of all Governmental Entities, and the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or under any
other Antitrust Law, necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
herein. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to _Section 5.3_, each of Parent and
the Company shall not, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to,
engage in any action or transaction that would materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and
the Company further covenant and agree, with respect to any threatened or
pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order, ruling or statute,
Regulation or executive order that would materially adversely affect the
ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to use their respective reasonable best efforts to prevent the
entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be, including by
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 6.3(a)_ to
obtain all requisite Permits, consents, and expirations or terminations of
applicable waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law (i) cooperate in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party; (ii) keep the other party and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity and of
any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iii) permit the other party and/or its counsel to review
in advance any written communication intended to be given by it to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC,
the DOJ or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent not
prohibited by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other
Person, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all Laws, Orders and judicial doctrines
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

 

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement
contemplated by this Agreement, under any Antitrust Law (A) each of Parent and
the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, 



 

48  that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to permit such
consummation by the second (2nd) Business Day before the Outside Date and (B)
each of Parent and the Company shall defend, at its cost and expense, any
action or actions, whether judicial or administrative, against it or its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by either Parent
or the Company to consummate the Merger, (i) in no event shall Parent or any
of its Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking
or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or
accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to take any action (A)
the effectiveness or consummation of which is not conditional on the
consummation of the Merger or (B) that individually or in the aggregate is or
would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse (with materiality, for
purposes of this provision, being measured in relation to the size of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) to (1) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, either before or
after giving effect to the Merger, or (2) Parents ownership or operation of
any portion of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries business or assets;
and (ii) without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action, agree to take any action or
consent to the taking of any action pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_ with
respect to selling, holding separate, licensing or otherwise disposing of
assets or conducting its business in a specified manner.

(e) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, employees and shareholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing,
notice, application or other document made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus).

(f) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,

Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
regarding the terms of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and neither shall issue any such press release or make any
such statement without the prior approval of the other (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public statement or
disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party before issuing such press release or making such public statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , _that_ any public statement or disclosure that is
consistent with a public statement or disclosure previously approved by the
other party shall not require the prior approval of such other party.

Section 6.5  _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances_. Subject to the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other 



 

49  parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to promptly
cause to be fulfilled the conditions to Closing under this Agreement and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including (a) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from all Third
Parties, (b) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
6.3_ and (c) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Parent shall, through the period beginning at the Effective Time and
ending December 31, 2010, maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit
plans and compensation opportunities (including base pay, annual cash
incentive opportunities and commission opportunities, as applicable, but
excluding equity-based compensation) for the benefit of non-bargaining
unit Employees employed in the United States (" _Company Salaried Employees_
") that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities provided to such Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall cause each Company Salaried Employee to receive full credit
for all service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors (to the same extent provided by the Company as of the
date hereof) under and for the purposes of any plan or arrangement providing
vacation, sick pay, severance, retirement, welfare or pension benefits
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates in which such Company Salaried Employees participate for
all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual
and forms of benefit), except that the foregoing shall not apply with respect
to benefit accrual under any final average pay defined pension plan or to the
extent that such credit would result in any duplication of benefits. In the
event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Company Salaried
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Company Salaried Employees under any such
welfare benefits to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting
period would not apply in the absence of such change; and (ii) credit each
Company Salaried Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
any such change during the applicable calendar year in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change.
If, within six months following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity or
any of its Affiliates causes the involuntary termination (other than
termination for "cause") of a Company Salaried Employees employment with the
Surviving Entity and/or its Subsidiaries, then the terminated Company Salaried
Employee will be entitled to receive severance payments and benefits that are
not less favorable than the severance and benefits he or she would have been
entitled to receive under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _provided, that_ except as provided in _Section
6.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, such payments and benefits do not
exceed the payments and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent pursuant the terms of the applicable severance arrangements maintained
by Parent, and _provided further, that_ this sentence shall not apply to any
Company Salaried Employee who is party to any employment, change of control,
severance, retention, or similar agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries providing for severance protections.



 

50 (c) The Company shall, if so requested in writing by Parent no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, terminate any and all
Company Benefit Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement
(each a " _401(k) Plan_ "). In the event that Parent provides such written
notice to the Company, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such 401(k) Plans have been terminated (effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board. In the event that Parent shall require termination of the Companys
401(k) Plans prior to the Closing, Parent shall, prior to the Closing Date,
amend its Code Section 401(k) plans to the extent necessary to (a) permit the
rollover of accounts from such terminated 401(k) Plans and (b) allow for
immediate entry and participation by employees of the Company who were
eligible to participate on or prior to the Closing Date in the 401(k) Plans,
each amendment to be effective as of the Closing.

(d) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, Parent shall
cause all of the Company Benefit Plans listed in _Section 3.14(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter to be honored in accordance with their terms.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained
herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Company Benefit
Plan, (ii) except as expressly stated with regard to other sections of this
Agreement, give any third party, including any Employee, any right to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement (including this _Section 6.6_), (iii)
obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Entity) to
(A) maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement or (B) retain the employment of any particular Employee, or (iv)
limit Parents or any of its Affiliates ability to amend any plan, program,
policy or arrangement.

Section 6.7 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity shall,
with respect to indemnification of directors, officers and employees not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Persons who at any
time prior to the Effective Time were identified as prospective indemnitees
under the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present and former directors, officers and employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacities as such (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was a
director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
in which such Indemnified Party was serving at the request of the Company, and
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or
omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) or taken at the request of Parent or otherwise under this
Agreement.



 

51 (c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time and any other person who is covered by the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance policy to be covered with respect to acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time by (i) the directors and officers liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company ( _provided_ , _that_ Parent may
substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, with policy
limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable as the limits, terms and
conditions in the existing policy of the Company); or (ii) a single premium
tail coverage with respect to such directors and officers liability
insurance with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable as
the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policy of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ in no
event shall Parent be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount
pursuant to this _Section 6.7(c)_ in excess of three hundred percent (300%)
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the
" _Insurance Amount_ "); and _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ if such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Insurance Amount, Parent will obtain the
maximum amount of directors and officers insurance (or "tail" coverage)
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Insurance Amount.

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns or the Surviving
Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable from and
after the Effective Time by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.9 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
take all commercially reasonable actions as may be required to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company or acquisitions of equity
securities of Parent resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.10 _Notification_. From and after the date hereof until the Closing
Date, each party hereto will promptly notify the other party hereto of (a) the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of
which would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of such party
to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
not to be satisfied, (b) the failure of such party to comply with
any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it pursuant to this
Agreement or the failure of any representation or warranty made by it to be
true and correct, in either case, which would be likely to result in any
condition to the obligations of the other party to effect the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, (c) the
receipt of any notice or other communication from any Third Party alleging
that the consent of such Person is or 



 

52  may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(d) any action, suit or proceeding is commenced against such party or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates that relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby. No delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ will cure
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such
party contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and Parent shall promptly advise each other of any
change or event that has or would reasonably be expected to
result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

counsels respective delivery of opinions pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ and
_Section 7.3(c)_ and in connection with any tax opinions required under the
Tax Matters Agreement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that
would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action
which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations
included in the certificates described in this _Section 6.13(a)(iii)_.



 

53 (b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording,

file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another
appropriate form) registering a number of Parent Shares equal to the number of
Parent Shares subject to the Parent Exchange Options and, if applicable, the
Adjusted Deferred Units. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current

Company Stock Plans or the Company Stock Plans under which the Company
Deferred Units are provided remain outstanding after the Effective Time.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any state takeover
or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Subject to the 



 

54  Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_,
the Company and the Company Board shall not take any action to approve any
Takeover Proposal made by any Third Party for purposes of any state takeover
Law or to cause any state takeover Law that would otherwise apply to any such
Takeover Proposal to become inapplicable thereto. Without limiting the

certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by an executive officer
of Parent to such effect.

(c) _Tax Opinion_. Unless the circumstances described in _Section 1.6_ arise
so as to require a restructuring of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (in which event, the condition

such failure was caused by such partys failure to comply in any material
respect with its respective obligations under this Agreement to be performed
at or prior to the Closing Date.

without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

_Sections 8.3(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f)_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a final judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. (or its

such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

this Agreement with a legal, valid and enforceable provision that shall
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable provision.

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered
pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Parent Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance
with its terms. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE COMPANY, PARENT OR
MERGER SUB MAKE ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (AND NONE OF THE
COMPANY, PARENT OR MERGER SUB ARE RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OTHER THAN AS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT) AND EACH HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR
DISCLOSURE TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PARTYS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENT OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

Section 9.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub, upon two (2) Business
Days prior written notice to the Company, may, subject to _Sections 1.6_ and
_5.2(d)_ , assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct (or indirect,
in the event that the transaction is restructured pursuant to Section 1.6)
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, _provided, that_ no such assignment shall
relieve Parent, Merger Sub or ADT Security Services of any of its obligations
hereunder and _provided further, that_ such assignment shall not impede or
delay the ability of the parties to obtain any necessary approvals of any
Governmental Entity required for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise impede the rights of the Company Shareholders under
this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.



 

74 Section 9.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (a) the rights of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger

equity awards of the Company pursuant to _Section 2.7_ from the Effective
Time, (c) the right of the Company on behalf of the Company Shareholders to
pursue damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic
benefits of the transaction to the Company Shareholders) in the event of
Parents or Merger Subs failure to effect the Merger as required by this
Agreement or material breach of this Agreement that contributed to a failure
of any of the conditions to Closing from being satisfied, which right is
hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by each of Parent, Merger Sub and
ADT Security Services, who shall each be jointly and severally liable for any
such damages for which Parent and/or Merger Sub are found liable, and (d) the
rights of Indemnified Parties under the provisions of  _Section 6.7_
(Indemnification of Directors and Officers), this Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto, any
rights or remedies hereunder. The third-party beneficiary rights referenced
in clause (c) of the preceding sentence may be exercised only by the Company
(on behalf of the Company Shareholders as their agent) through actions
expressly approved by the Company Board, and no Company Shareholder,
whether purporting to act in its capacity as a shareholder or purporting to
assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the Company, shall
have any right or ability to exercise or cause the exercise of any such right.
The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and ADT Security Services acknowledge and
agree that the agreements contained in _Section 9.9(c)_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that ADT Security
Services obligations hereunder are a material inducement to the Company
entering into this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company
would not enter into this Agreement.
