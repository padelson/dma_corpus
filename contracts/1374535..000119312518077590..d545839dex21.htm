AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is made
and entered into as of March 7, 2018, by and among: (i) Fortive Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Fox"); (ii) Stevens Holding Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Fox ("Newco"); (iii) Altra
Industrial Motion Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Ainge"); and (iv) McHale
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Ainge ("Merger Sub"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in _Exhibit A_.

 

RECITALS

A. Fox, directly and indirectly through its wholly owned Subsidiaries, is
engaged in the AandS Business.

B. Fox has determined that it would be desirable to separate the AandS Business
from Fox.

C. In order to effect such separation, prior to the Effective Time (or as
otherwise contemplated by Section 3 of the Distribution Agreement), Fox will
undertake the Internal Restructuring and, in connection therewith, effect the
Newco Contribution and, in exchange therefor, Newco shall (i) issue to
Fox additional shares of Newco Common Stock and the Newco Securities and (ii)
distribute to Fox a cash dividend (the "Cash Dividend") in an amount equal to
the Basis Amount.

 

D. Following the Newco Contribution, Fox shall transfer the Newco Securities
to certain Persons (the "Debt Exchange Parties") in exchange for certain debt
obligations of Fox held by the Debt Exchange Parties as principals for their
own account (the "Debt Exchange").

 

E. Following the Debt Exchange, the Debt Exchange Parties are expected to sell
the Newco Securities.

 

F. Prior to the Effective Time, the Direct Sales Sellers shall sell the Direct
Sales Assets and Direct Sales Entities (and their Subsidiaries) to the Direct
Sales Purchasers, and the Direct Sales Purchasers shall assume the Direct
Sales Assumed Liabilities (the "Direct Sales").

 

G. Prior to the Effective Time (or as otherwise contemplated by Section 3 of
the Distribution Agreement) and after the Newco Contribution, Fox and Newco
will effect the Distribution.

H. The respective boards of directors of each of Fox, Newco, Ainge and Merger
Sub have each approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Direct Sales and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into Newco immediately following the Distribution, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL (the "Merger").

I. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) it is intended that the Newco
Contribution, taken together with the Distribution, will qualify for non-
recognition of gain or loss pursuant to Sections 355, 361 and 368(a)(1)(D) of
the Code; (ii) it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and (iii)
each of this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

 

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:



   1. | DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION 
---|--- 

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Newco. By virtue of the Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Newco shall continue as the surviving
corporation in

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all
of the restrictions, debt and duties of Merger Sub in accordance with the
DGCL.

1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 1.3 Direct Sales. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Direct Sales
Asset Sellers shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver the
Direct Sales Assets held by the Direct Sales Asset Sellers to the Direct
Sales Asset Purchasers, and the Direct Sales Asset Purchasers shall purchase
and acquire all right, title and interest of the Direct Sales Asset Sellers in
and to the Direct Sales Assets held by the Direct Sales Asset Sellers free
and clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances; (ii) the
Direct Sales Asset Purchasers shall assume all of the Direct Sales Assumed
Liabilities associated with such Direct Sales Assets; and (iii) the Direct
Sales Entity Sellers shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver all of
the equity interests held by them in the Direct Sales Entities to the Direct
Sales Entity Purchasers, and the Direct Sales Entity Purchasers shall
purchase and acquire all right, title and interest of the Direct Sales Entity
Sellers in the Direct Sales Entities free and clear of any Encumbrances other
than Permitted Encumbrances.

 

1.4 Direct Sales Purchase Price.

 

(a) The purchase price for the Direct Sales Assets and Direct Sales Entities
(and their Subsidiaries) to be purchased hereunder is $1,000,000,000 (the
"Direct Sales Purchase Price"), which Direct Sales Purchase Price shall be
adjusted to reflect any amendment to the Separation Plan in accordance with
the terms of the Distribution Agreement, with the purchase price attributable
to each Direct Sales Entity and each Direct Sales Asset Seller set forth in
the Separation Plan; _provided_ that the Direct Sales Purchase Price shall not
(i) be increased unless Ainge shall have obtained commitments in respect of
the Direct Sales Financing in the amount of such increase on terms and
conditions satisfactory to Ainge in its sole discretion or (ii) be decreased
unless Newco shall have obtained commitments in respect of the
Newco Financing in the amount of such decrease on terms and conditions
satisfactory to Ainge in its sole discretion. The Direct Sales Purchase Price
will be paid or caused to be paid by the Direct Sales Purchasers to Fox or one
or more Subsidiaries designated by Fox, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such bank account or accounts as per written instructions
of Fox given to the Direct Sales Purchasers at least three (3) business days
prior to Closing; provided that in the event of any Adjustment Payment
pursuant to Section 1.16, a portion of the Direct Sales Purchase Price equal
to the Total Adjustment Amount shall not be required to be paid at the Closing
by the Direct Sales Purchasers and this portion of the Direct Sales Purchase
Price instead shall be paid by them to Fox or one or more Subsidiaries
designated by Fox as promptly as practicable following the Closing, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account or accounts as
per written instructions of Fox given to the Direct Sales Purchasers at least
three (3) business days prior to payment.

(b) No later than thirty (30) days after the Closing, the Direct Sales
Sellers shall cause to be delivered to the Direct Sales Purchasers a statement
(the "Direct Sales Allocation Statement") allocating the purchase
price attributable to each Direct Sales Entity and each Direct Sales Asset
Seller as set forth in the Separation Plan and any relevant Direct Sales
Assumed Liabilities among the Direct Sales Assets as of the Closing. Such
allocation shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any similar provision
of non-U.S. Tax Law to the extent applicable.

 

(c) If the Direct Sales Purchasers disagree with the Direct Sales Allocation
Statement, the Direct Sales Purchasers may, no later than thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Direct Sales Purchasers of the Direct Sales Allocation
Statement (the "Direct Sales Review Period"), deliver a notice to the Direct
Sales Sellers providing reasonable detail of the reason for any disagreement
and setting forth the Direct Sales Purchasers proposed allocation (a "Dispute
Notice"). Any such notice of disagreement shall specify all items or amounts

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 with which the Direct Sales Purchasers disagree. If the Dispute Notice is
duly delivered, the Direct Sales Sellers and Direct Sales Purchasers shall,
during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts. If the
Direct Sales Sellers and Direct Sales Purchasers are unable to reach such
agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Accounting Firm to
resolve any remaining disputes.

(d) Unless the Direct Sales Purchasers deliver a Dispute Notice to the Direct
Sales Sellers on or prior to the expiration of the Direct Sales Review
Period, the Direct Sales Purchasers shall be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the Direct Sales Allocation Statement delivered pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_, and the Direct Sales Allocation Statement shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Direct Sales Seller, the Direct Sales
Purchasers and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

 

(e) The Direct Sales Sellers, the Direct Sales Purchasers and their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the
final Direct Sales Allocation Statement (as adjusted pursuant to any agreement
between the Direct Sales Sellers and Direct Sales Purchasers or as determined
by the Accounting Firm), unless otherwise required by a "determination"
(within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code).

1.5 Foreign Implementing Agreements. Promptly after the date hereof, Fox and
Ainge shall cause the Direct Sales Sellers and Direct Sales Purchasers,
respectively, to prepare and implement the Foreign Implementing Agreements.
Fox and Ainge agree that such Foreign Implementing Agreements shall not
expand or limit the rights and obligations of the Direct Sales Sellers, on the
one hand, or the Direct Sales Purchasers, on the other hand, beyond those
provided for Fox and Ainge, respectively, in this Agreement or Fox and Newco,
respectively, in the Distribution Agreement, and that the Foreign Implementing
Agreements shall not provide for any additional rights or obligations of the
Direct Sales Parties that are not so provided for in this Agreement or the
Distribution Agreement, except to the extent required to comply with
applicable Law. Fox and Ainge shall cause the Direct Sales Sellers and the
Direct Sales Purchasers, respectively, to cooperate in the preparation of such
Foreign Implementing Agreements. In the event of any conflict between the
terms of such Foreign Implementing Agreements and this Agreement or the
Distribution Agreement, Fox and Ainge agree and acknowledge that the terms of
this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement shall control and that, if
necessary, Fox and Ainge shall cause the Direct Sales Sellers and the Direct
Sales Purchasers, respectively, to deliver such additional instruments or make
such arrangements as may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

1.6 Non-Assignable Assets and Entities. If and to the extent that the
Conveyance of any Direct Sales Entity or Direct Sales Asset to any Direct
Sales Purchaser would be a violation of applicable Laws or require any Consent
or Governmental Approval in connection with the Direct Sales that has not
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, then, notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, the Conveyance to the Direct Sales Purchaser of such Direct
Sales Asset or Direct Sales Entity (any such asset or entity, a "Deferred
Asset") shall automatically be deferred and no Conveyance of such Deferred
Asset shall occur until all legal impediments are removed or such Consents or
Governmental Approvals have been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such Deferred Asset shall still be considered a Direct Sales Asset or Direct
Sales Entity, as applicable, and the Person retaining such asset or entity
shall thereafter hold such asset or entity in trust for the benefit of the
Person entitled thereto (and at such Persons sole expense) until the
consummation of the Direct Sale thereof. To the extent that any Deferred Asset
cannot be Conveyed without the Consent or Governmental Approval of any Person
which Consent or Governmental Approval has not been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to Convey such
Deferred Asset if an attempted Conveyance would constitute a breach thereof or
violate any Law. Fox and Ainge shall cause the Direct Sales Sellers and the
Direct Sales Purchasers, respectively, to use their reasonable best efforts to
develop and implement mutually acceptable arrangements to place the Person
entitled to receive such Deferred Asset, insofar as reasonably possible, in
the same position as if such Deferred Asset had been Conveyed as contemplated
hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Deferred
Asset, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, any Tax
Liabilities in respect thereof and dominion, ability to enforce the rights
under or with respect to, control and

 command over such Deferred Asset, are to inure from and after the Effective
Time. Such arrangements may include, among others, the entry into reseller
agreements with respect to government Contracts, or the entry into
subcontracting, sublicensing, subleasing or other similar agreements. Under
any such arrangements, Fox will cause the Direct Sales Seller retaining the
Deferred Asset to agree to enforce (at Ainges cost and at its reasonable
request) any and all claims, rights and benefits of the applicable Direct
Sales Seller against any third parties arising from such Deferred Asset. If
and when the legal or contractual impediments the presence of which caused
the deferral of transfer of any Deferred Asset pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 1.6_ are removed or any Consents and/or Governmental Approvals the absence
of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Deferred Asset pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ are obtained, the transfer of the applicable
Deferred Asset shall be effected in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and/or such applicable Ancillary Agreement (as defined in the
Distribution Agreement). The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
1.6_ shall survive for the duration of the term of the applicable Contract
(without any obligation to renew or extend).

 

1.7 Closing; Effective Time. Unless the transactions contemplated hereby shall
have been abandoned and this Agreement terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1_, the closing of the Merger, the Direct Sales and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time, at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP ("Cravath"), 825

be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
each of such conditions) or (ii) at such other date, time or place as Ainge
and Fox may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing actually takes place
is referred to as the "Closing Date". Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of
the DGCL shall be duly executed by Newco and concurrently with or as soon as
practicable following the Closing shall be filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time of
the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be designated jointly by Fox
and Ainge and specified in such certificate of merger (the time as of which

Assets are located and reasonably acceptable to the Direct Sales Parties).

Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Fox, Newco, Ainge, Merger Sub or any stockholder of Fox or Ainge:

 

(i) each share of Newco Common Stock owned by Fox, any Subsidiary of Newco, or
any other Subsidiary of Fox immediately prior to the Effective Time (or held
in Newcos treasury) shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) each share of Newco Common Stock owned by Ainge, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Ainge immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

 

(iii) except as provided in _Sections 1.10(a)(i)_ and _1.10(a)(ii)_ and
subject to _Sections 1.10(c)_  and _1.10(d)_ , each share of Newco Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive an aggregate number of duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Ainge Common Stock equal to
(x) the Ainge Share Amount divided by (y) the aggregate number of shares of
Newco Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the

1.10(a)(i)_ and _1.10(a)(ii)_ ); and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger

split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
combination of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by Ainge during such

be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

(c) If any shares of Newco Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted equity
purchase agreement or other Contract with Newco or under which Newco has any
rights, then (except to the extent provided in any binding agreement between
Newco and the holder thereof): (i) the shares of Ainge Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Newco Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
and (ii) such shares of Ainge Common Stock, whether represented by

entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in
any such restricted stock or interest purchase agreement or other Contract.

 

(d) No fractional shares of Ainge Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of shares of Newco Common Stock who would

(after aggregating all fractional shares of Ainge Common Stock issuable to
such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share, be paid in cash the
dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), after deducting any
required withholding taxes, on a pro rata basis, without interest, determined
by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of Ainge Common
Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last business day prior to the
date on which the Merger becomes effective. Payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Ainge Common Stock shall be made solely for the purpose
of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Ainge of issuing fractional

consideration.

 

1.11 Exchange of Newco Common Stock.

 

(a) Pursuant to Section 3 of the Distribution Agreement, the Exchange Agent
(as defined below) shall hold, for the account of the relevant Fox
stockholders, book-entry shares representing all of the outstanding shares of

in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Fox shall appoint a reputable bank or trust
company reasonably satisfactory to Ainge as exchange agent in the Merger (the

respect to such shares of Ainge Common Stock, are referred to collectively as
the "Exchange Fund"). For the purposes of such deposit, Ainge will assume
that there will not be any fractional shares of Ainge Common Stock. Ainge will
make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from
time to time as needed or as reasonably requested by Fox, cash sufficient to
pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.10(d)_. Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions from Ainge, deliver the Ainge Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ from the shares of Ainge Common
Stock held in the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

shall cause the Exchange Agent to, deliver to each Person who was the record
holder of shares of Newco Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time

shares of Ainge Common Stock, from the Exchange Fund, that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
1.10(a)(iii)_ (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Ainge Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.10(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.11(d)_). From and after the Effective Time, any
shares formerly representing shares of Newco Common Stock will represent only

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the right to receive shares of Ainge Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Ainge Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
1.10(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.11(d)_).

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Ainge Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
or otherwise delivered to the holder of any shares of Newco Common Stock with
respect to the shares of Ainge Common Stock that are not able to
be distributed by the Exchange Agent to such holder promptly after the
Effective Time, whether due to a legal impediment to such distribution or
otherwise. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property law, escheat
law or other Legal Requirements, following the distribution of any such
previously undistributed shares of Ainge Common Stock, there shall be paid to
the record holder of such shares Ainge Common Stock, without interest, at the
time of the distribution, the amount of cash in lieu of any fractional share
of Ainge Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.10(d)_ and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Ainge Common
Stock. Ainge shall deposit all such dividends and distributions in the
Exchange Fund.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holder
of any shares of Newco Common Stock with respect to the shares of Ainge Common
Stock that are not able to be distributed by the Exchange Agent to such holder
as of the date that is one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Ainge upon demand, and any holders of shares of Newco Common Stock who have
not theretofore received their shares of Ainge Common Stock in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ shall thereafter look only to Ainge for
satisfaction of their claims for Ainge Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Ainge Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
1.10(d)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.11(d)_ with respect to shares of Ainge Common Stock, in each case without
interest thereon.

 

(f) Neither Ainge nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of shares of Newco Common Stock or to any other Person with
respect to any shares of Ainge Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, required to be delivered to
any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
law, escheat law or other Legal Requirement.

(g) All shares of Ainge Common Stock issued upon the exchange of Newco Common
Stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share of Ainge Common
Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.10(d)_ and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.11(d)_ shall have been deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Newco Common Stock.

 

1.12 Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Newco shall be closed and no transfer shall be made of any
shares of Newco Common Stock that were outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

1.13 Tax Consequences. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the U.S. Treasury Regulations. Each party hereto shall cause all Tax Returns
relating to the Merger filed by such party to be filed on the basis of
treating the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1) of the Code unless otherwise required by a "determination" (within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code).

 

1.14 No Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of shares of Newco Common
Stock in connection with the Merger, and Fox and Newco shall take all actions
necessary under Section 262 of the DGCL to ensure that appraisal rights in
connection with the Merger cannot be perfected by holders of shares of Newco
Common Stock on or after the Distribution Date.

1.15 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Ainge or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to 

 



7

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and
to all rights and property of Merger Sub and Newco, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Ainge shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, in the name of Newco and otherwise)  to take such action.

1.16 Adjustment. In the event that the AandS Business 2017 Adjusted EBITDA, as
reflected on the EBITDA Statement that is deemed final pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.13(c)_, is less than the amount set forth on _Schedule 1.16_ , then
Fox shall pay to Ainge (the "Adjustment Payment") in cash the amount, if any,
by which the product of (a) such shortfall _multiplied_ by (b) 13.5 exceeds
$30,000,000 (any such excess above $30,000,000, the "Adjustment Amount");
_provided_  that if the Adjustment Amount is greater than $150,000,000 (any
such excess of the Adjustment Amount above $150,000,000, the "Adjustment
Excess"), then the Adjustment Payment shall equal $150,000,000 and in addition
to the Adjustment Payment, Fox shall elect (i) to reduce the Ainge Share
Amount by an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the Adjustment Excess
_divided by_ (B) $45.20 (the "Ainge Share Amount Reduction");  _provided_
that the Ainge Share Amount Reduction would not result in the Fox stockholders
holding less than the Ainge Share Minimum immediately following the Effective
Time, (ii) to pay to Ainge an additional amount in cash equal to
the Adjustment Excess (such amount, if any, together with the Adjustment
Amount, the "Total Adjustment Amount") or (iii) to provide Ainge a written
notice giving Ainge the right to terminate this Agreement; _provided_ that
if Ainge shall not terminate this Agreement within five (5) business days of
receipt of such notice, the Adjustment Payment shall equal $150,000,000 and
there shall be no further payment, and there shall be no Ainge Share Amount
Reduction, for the Adjustment Excess. Such amount or amounts shall be paid to
Ainge only in the event that the Closing occurs and shall be paid to Ainge by
wire transfer of same-day funds at Closing. Except as otherwise expressly
provided, the foregoing adjustment shall not affect any partys rights to
terminate this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 8_. Any payment made pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 1.16_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as a
contribution by Fox to Newco made immediately prior to the Distribution, and
therefore as an adjustment to the Cash Dividend (to the extent of the Cash
Dividend), unless the Parties mutually agree to instead treat any
such payment (or portion thereof) as an adjustment to the portion of the
Direct Sales Purchase Price attributable to one or more Direct Sales, in each
case to the extent permitted by Law.

 

1.17 Withholding.

 

(a) Each of the Exchange Agent, Ainge, the Surviving Corporation, the Direct
Sales Asset Purchasers and the Direct Sales Entity Purchasers, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(b) If the Direct Sales Purchasers determine that it is necessary to withhold
any portion of the Direct Sales Purchase Price, the Direct Sales Purchasers
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide Fox with reasonable
notice and shall work in good faith with Fox to reduce or eliminate the need
to withhold, _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Ainge nor any Direct Sales
Purchasers shall be required to incur any material costs or expenses to reduce
or eliminate such need to withhold. If any Taxes are required by any
jurisdiction to be deducted or withheld from the Direct Sales Purchase Price
and such requirement to deduct or withhold arose or arises as a result of any
Direct Sales Purchaser having been organized under the laws of, or having a
place of business in, a jurisdiction, in each case, that is not the
jurisdiction in which the applicable Direct Sales Seller is located or the
jurisdiction in which the applicable Direct Sales Assets or Direct Sales
Entities are located, such payment shall be increased as necessary so that
after such deduction or withholding has been made, the recipient of such
payment receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been made;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
payment shall not be so increased if Ainge and the Direct Sales Purchasers
have provided Fox with reasonable notice and worked in good faith with Fox in
the manner described in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.17(b)_.

or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Ainge, its
Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Ainge, any other party to the Direct Sales
Commitment Letter under any term or condition of the Direct Sales Commitment
Letter or would result in any portion of the financing contemplated thereby
being unavailable or delayed. Ainge has fully paid any and all commitment

Sales Financing will be sufficient to fund Ainges purchase of the Direct
Sales Assets and Direct Sales Entities (and their Subsidiaries) as
contemplated by this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement. Other than as
set forth in the Direct Sales Commitment Letter, there are no conditions
precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Direct Sales Financing. As
of the date of this Agreement, assuming (x) compliance by Fox and Newco with
the covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement and (y) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Fox and Newco in this
Agreement, Ainge (i) is not aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that
would cause the commitments provided in the Direct Sales Commitment Letter to
be terminated or to become ineffective and (ii) has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Direct Sales Financing (which are within its
control) will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Direct Sales
Financing will not be available to Ainge immediately prior to the closing of
the Direct Sales. The parties hereto agree that it shall not be a condition to
the Closing for Ainge to obtain the Direct Sales Financing or the Alternative
Direct Sales Financing.

 

(b) Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth

submitted to Ainge by such Person (and not withdrawn) which after consultation

(i) the AandS Business, the Newco Assets, the Direct Sales Assets or an AandS
Company or (ii) Ainge, as the case may be, or Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to either (x) the AandS Business, the Newco Assets, the Direct Sales

thereof, including a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry and any other documentation in respect of such Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry received from the proponent thereof or its

   5. | ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES 
---|--- 
 

5.1 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any
event, within twelve (12) weeks after the date of this Agreement), Fox shall
cause to be prepared the financial statements contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.13(a)_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date such financial
statements are delivered to Ainge, (i) Ainge shall cause to be filed with the
SEC the Ainge Form S-4 Registration Statement, in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus and (ii) Fox shall cause
to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form 10 or a
registration statement on Form S-1/S-4, as applicable (together with any
amendments, supplements, prospectus or information statements thereto, the
"Newco Registration Statements") to register the shares of Newco Common Stock
to be distributed in the Distribution. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Ainge Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Newco Registration
Statements have been declared effective, Fox shall file with the SEC a
Schedule TO (together with any amendments thereto, the "Schedule TO") if Fox
elects to effect the Distribution in whole or in part by means of an Exchange
Offer (as defined in the Distribution Agreement). Ainge and Fox shall file
such other appropriate documents with the SEC as may be applicable. Each of
Ainge and Fox shall: (A) cause the Ainge Form S-4

 Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Newco
Registration Statements and the Schedule TO (if applicable) to comply with the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC; (B) promptly notify
the other of, cooperate with each other with respect to, provide the other
party (and its Representatives) with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on, and respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Ainge Form S-4 Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Newco Registration Statements or the Schedule TO (if
applicable); (C) provide the other party (and its Representatives) with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Ainge Form S-4
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Newco Registration
Statements or the Schedule TO (if applicable), prior to filing of any such
document with the SEC; (D) have each of the Ainge Form S-4 Registration
Statement and the Newco Registration Statements become effective under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, respectively, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after each is filed with the SEC (it being understood
that each of Ainge and Fox shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Ainge Form S-4 to become effective under the Securities Act prior to the date
on which the financial statements included therein would become stale); and
(E) keep each of the Ainge Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Newco
Registration Statements effective through the Closing in order to permit the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Ainge shall cause to be filed
with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Ainges stockholders, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Ainge Form S-4 Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act. Each of Ainge and Fox
shall promptly furnish the other party all information concerning such party,
its Subsidiaries and stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested
in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_. If,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance shall be
discovered by either Ainge or Fox, or either Ainge or Fox becomes aware of any
information furnished by it, in either case, that should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Ainge Form S-4 Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Newco Registration Statements or the Schedule
TO (if applicable) so that such document or documents would not include any
untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, then such party: (i) shall promptly
inform the other party thereof; (ii) shall provide the other party (and its
Representatives) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Ainge Form S-4 Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Newco Registration Statements or the Schedule

with a copy of such amendment or supplement promptly after it is filed with
the SEC; and (iv) shall cooperate, if appropriate, in mailing such amendment
or supplement to the stockholders of Ainge or Fox (as the case may be). Fox
acknowledges that Ainges ability to comply with its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_ depend, in part, on Foxs timely compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_, and therefore Ainge shall be afforded a
reasonable period to comply with such obligations based upon the timing of
Fox providing the financial statements herein contemplated.

(b) Each of Ainge and Fox will also take all commercially reasonable actions
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities
laws in connection with, in the case of the Ainge, the issuance of Ainge
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and, in the case of Fox, the issuance of
shares of Newco Common Stock in the Distribution. If any state Takeover
Statute or similar Legal Requirement shall become applicable to the
Contemplated Transactions, each of the parties and their respective boards of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the Contemplated Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or by the other
Transaction Documents and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
of such statute or regulation on the Contemplated Transactions.

submit such proposal to such holders at the Ainge Stockholders Meeting.
Except as set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ of the Ainge Disclosure
Letter, Ainge shall not submit any other proposals for approval at the Ainge
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Fox (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Ainge in
consultation with Fox shall set a record date for Persons entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the Ainge Stockholders Meeting and shall not change such
record date without the prior written consent of Fox (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Ainge shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited by the Ainge Companies and
their Representatives in connection with the Ainge Stockholders Meeting are
solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Ainge
may after consultation with Fox adjourn or postpone the Ainge Stockholders
Meeting: (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is required by applicable
Legal Requirement (or in connection with the settlement of any
applicable litigation) is timely provided to Ainges stockholders; (ii) if as
of the time for which the Ainge Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
there are insufficient shares of Ainge Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the

Proposal is submitted to Ainge within ten (10) business days of the Ainge
Stockholders Meeting (and not withdrawn), which Acquisition Proposal the
Ainge Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, is, or could reasonably be expected to,
result in an Ainge Superior Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Ainge
Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned later than the date
that is ten (10) business days after the date on which Ainge receives such
Acquisition Proposal (the "Initial Receipt Period"); _provided_ that in the
event the Ainge Board reaffirms the Ainge Board Recommendation during the
Initial Receipt Period, the Ainge Stockholders Meeting may be postponed or
adjourned to the date that is five (5) business days after the date the Ainge
Board reaffirms the Ainge Board Recommendation; _provided_ _further_ that in
no event shall any such postponement or adjournment result in Ainge
establishing a new record date for such meeting. Unless this Agreement shall
have been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8_, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Ainge of its obligations to
submit the issuance of shares of Ainge Common Stock pursuant to the Merger to
its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof. Unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8_, Ainges
obligation to hold the Ainge Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.2(a)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal or
public disclosure of communication to Ainge of any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to Ainge or any Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Ainge or by any
Ainge Change in Recommendation.

 

(b) Except to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_: (i) the Ainge

and (iii) the Ainge Board Recommendation shall not be directly or indirectly
withdrawn or modified (or proposed to be withdrawn or modified) by the Ainge
Board nor any committee thereof in a manner adverse to Fox (an "Ainge Change

5.2(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the approval of
the issuance of shares of Ainge Common Stock pursuant to the Merger by the
Required Ainge Stockholder Vote, the Ainge Board may (x) effect, or cause
Ainge to effect, as the case may be, an Ainge Change in Recommendation, in the
case of clause (i) and (ii) below or (y) cause Ainge to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_, in the case of clause (i)
below:

after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes an Ainge Superior Offer; (D) the Ainge
Board does not effect, or cause Ainge to effect, an Ainge Change in
Recommendation or cause Ainge to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ at any time within four (4) business days (together
with any subsequent shorter period as contemplated by clause (E) below, the
"Notice Period") after Fox receives (x) written notice from Ainge that the
Ainge Board has determined that such Acquisition Proposal is an Ainge Superior
Offer and (y) a summary of the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and other information required to be provided pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_ (provided, that a new notice shall be required with
respect to each material modification to such offer (it being understood that
any change in the purchase price or form of consideration in such offer shall
be deemed a material modification) and a new Notice Period (of two (2)
business days) shall begin); (E) during the applicable Notice Period, if
requested by Fox, Ainge engages in good faith negotiations, and directs its
financial advisors and outside legal advisors to, engage in good faith
negotiations, with Fox to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
competing Acquisition Proposal does not constitute an Ainge Superior Offer;
and (F) at the end of the applicable Notice Period, such Acquisition Proposal
has not been withdrawn and constitutes an Ainge Superior Offer (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Fox as a result
of the negotiations required by clause (E) or otherwise), and (G) the Ainge
Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Ainge Superior
Offer, a failure to make an Ainge Change in Recommendation could reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Ainge Board to
Ainge stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements and such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes an Ainge Superior Offer (taking into account (x) any
modification to such offer and (y) any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Fox as a result of the negotiations required by clause (E) or
otherwise); or

(ii) if other than in connection with or as a result of the making of an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Ainge or an Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to Ainge, a material development, event, effect, state of facts or
change in circumstances that was not known or reasonably foreseeable (or if
known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability or magnitude of consequences
of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) occurs, arises or becomes
known to the Ainge Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
approval of the issuance of shares of Ainge Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger by the Required Ainge Stockholder Vote (such material development,
event, effect, state of facts or change in circumstances being referred to as
an "Intervening Event") (it being understood that that in no event shall (i)
any action taken by either party pursuant to and in compliance with the
affirmative covenants set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, and the consequences
of any such action or (ii) the receipt, existence of or terms of an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Ainge or an Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to Ainge or the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening
Event); (A) the Ainge Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that an
Intervening Event has occurred; (B) the Ainge Board does not effect, or cause
Ainge to effect, an Ainge Change in Recommendation at any time within four
(4) business days after Fox receives written notice from Ainge that the Ainge
Board has determined that an Intervening Event requires the Ainge Board to
effect, or cause Ainge to effect, an Ainge Change in Recommendation (
_provided_ , that a new notice shall be required with respect to any change in
circumstances and a new notice period of two (2) business days shall begin);
(C) during such applicable period, if requested by Fox, Ainge engages in good
faith negotiations, and directs its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors to, engage in good faith negotiations, with Fox to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the Ainge Board
to effect, or cause Ainge to effect, an Ainge Change in Recommendation as a
result of such Intervening Event; and (D) the Ainge Board determines in good
faith, after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light
of such Intervening

 Event, a failure to make an Ainge Change in Recommendation could reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Ainge Board to
Ainges stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.

(d) (i) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ will prohibit
Ainge from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by
Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii)
no disclosure that the Ainge Board may determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that it or Ainge, as applicable, is
required to make under applicable Legal Requirements will constitute a
violation of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event
under clause (i) or (ii) the Ainge Board shall not make an Ainge Change in
Recommendation except in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_. It is
expressly understood and agreed by the parties that a "stop, look and listen"
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act shall not be deemed an Ainge Change in Recommendation;
_provided_ that the Ainge Board expressly reaffirms the Ainge Board
Recommendation within ten (10) business days of the public announcement of any
applicable Acquisition Proposal.

 

5.3 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

 

(a) Each party shall file all notices, reports and other documents required to
be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger
and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional
information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing or  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, Ainge and Fox each
shall, promptly (and in any event, with respect to clause (x), within ten (10)
business days after the date of this Agreement), prepare and file (x) the
notifications required under the HSR Act and (y) the mandatory notifications
required under any applicable foreign Competition Laws in connection with the
Merger. Ainge and Fox each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act, and
Ainge and Fox shall each (i) cooperate with the other party in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly
supply the other party with any information which may be required in order to
effectuate notices, reports, documents or other filings with any Governmental
Body required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act and mandatory notifications
required under any applicable foreign Competition Laws (the "Antitrust
Filings"); and (iii) promptly supply any additional information which
reasonably may be required by any Governmental Body in connection with
Antitrust Filings or which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate. Each
of Ainge and Fox will notify the other party promptly upon the receipt of
(and, if in writing, share a copy of) any communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Bodies and of
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any Antitrust Filings, Ainge or Fox, as the case
may be, will promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate
in filing with the applicable Governmental Body (and share a copy of) such
amendment or supplement. Each of Ainge and Fox shall give the other party
prompt notice of the commencement or known threat of commencement of any Legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger or
any of the other Contemplated Transactions, shall keep the other party
reasonably informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat,
and, in connection with any such Legal Proceeding, will permit
authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting
or conference relating to any such Legal Proceeding and to have access to and
be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any such Legal
Proceeding. Fox and Newco agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ (but subject to the actions
permitted under  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_), in connection with any Antitrust
Filings or any action to be taken or commitment to be made by Fox, Newco and
their Affiliates to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, Fox and Newco
(1) shall not, without Ainges prior written consent, (A) sell, divest or
dispose of any Newco Assets or any businesses or product lines of the AandS
Business; (B) license any Newco IP; or (C) take any other action or commit to
take any action that would limit Ainges, Newcos or their respective
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain
any of, their businesses, product lines or assets or Intellectual Property
Rights and

 (2) subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, agree to take any action
contemplated by clause (1) above if requested in writing by Ainge; _provided_
that the effectiveness of any such action is conditioned on the Closing.

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, each of Ainge, Fox, Merger Sub and
Newco agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary or advisable to satisfy each of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 6_ and _7_ , consummate the Merger and make effective the
other Contemplated Transactions ( _provided_ that no party shall be required
to waive any of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6_ or  _7_ , as
applicable, to its obligations to consummate the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions) in each case as promptly as is reasonably
practicable but in any event so as to permit the Closing to occur prior to the
End Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, each party to this Agreement agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to: (i) as promptly as practicable, prepare and file
all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and
given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions; (ii) obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained
(pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by
such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions (including Ainge providing a guarantee of Newcos obligations
reasonably necessary to obtain such Consents); and (iii) lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Merger ( _provided_ that, other than fees
and expenses of outside counsel and other Representatives, no party shall be
required to make any payment, assume any material obligations or offer or
grant any material concessions to any Person (other than any Governmental
Bodies) to obtain any Consent).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_,
none of Ainge, Fox, Merger Sub or Newco shall have any obligation under this
Agreement (except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the
Distribution Agreement or any other Transaction Document) to divest or agree
to divest (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to divest or agree to divest) any
of its respective material businesses, material product lines or material
assets, or to take or agree to take (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to take
or agree to take) any other material action or agree (or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to agree) to any material limitation or material restriction on
any of its respective material businesses, material product lines or material
assets, except, solely with respect to the HSR Act and the Additional
Antitrust Consents, as would not, or as would not reasonably be expected to,
have an adverse impact that is material to (i) the AandS Business, taken as a
whole, or (ii) the Ainge Companies, taken as a whole (any such adverse impact
in (i) or (ii), a "Burdensome Condition") (it being understood that no such
action shall be considered for purposes of determining whether an Ainge
Material Adverse Effect or Newco Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur and the parties shall not be required to take
any of the foregoing actions in this clause (c) unless the effectiveness of
such action is conditioned on the Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
such divestiture of assets may occur if such divestiture would constitute a
Fox Disqualifying Action or a Newco Disqualifying Action (as defined in the
Tax Matters Agreement).

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Fox
or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to (i) a sale, divestiture or other
disposition, or the holding separate before or after the Closing Date, of any
assets, lines of business or interests of Fox or its Subsidiaries outside the
AandS Business or (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions
in, the operations of any such assets, lines of business or interests.

(e) Each party shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or
agree to acquire any business or entity, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, if doing so could reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, the Debt Exchange or
Newco Financing, increase the risk of not obtaining any consents of any
Governmental Body necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions or
give rise to a requirement to obtain any additional Governmental
Authorizations not currently required to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.

5.4 Disclosure. Ainge and Fox shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement regarding this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. Fox shall

party hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public

other party hereto prior to issuing any such press release or making any
such public announcement or statement; and (iii) Ainge need not consult with
Fox in connection with any press release, public statement or filing to be

the independent accountants for the AandS Business and Newco (collectively,

such annual financial statements from the independent accountants for the AandS
Business and Newco, in each case together with the notes thereto, and prepared
from the books and records of Fox and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with
GAAP (it being understood, however, that the AandS Business has not been
operating historically as a separate "standalone" entity or reporting segment
and, therefore, the financial statements of the AandS Business will reflect
certain allocations made that may not reflect what would have been incurred
if the AandS Business had been a standalone business) applied on a consistent
basis through the periods involved (except as may otherwise be required under
GAAP) and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the requirements of
Regulation S-X, and Fox shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that

with Ainge in connection with Ainges preparation of pro forma financial
statements that comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC to
the extent required for SEC filings, including the requirements of Regulation
S-X, and for the twelve (12) month period ending on the last day of the most

financial statements of the AandS Business and Newco (before giving effect to
the Internal Restructuring) for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in
the Audited Financial Statements (the "EBITDA Statement"). Upon receipt of the
EBITDA Statement, Ainge shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt of the EBITDA Statement (the "EBITDA Statement Review Period")
to notify Fox of Ainges election to accept or reject the EBITDA Statement
(or any portion thereof). In the event Ainge rejects the EBITDA Statement as
prepared by Fox within the EBITDA Statement Review Period, such rejection
notice (the "EBITDA Statement Rejection Notice") must contain the reasons for
such rejection in reasonable detail and set forth the amount of the requested
adjustment. In the event no notice is received by Fox during the EBITDA
Statement Review Period, the EBITDA Statement and any required adjustments
resulting therefrom shall be deemed to have been accepted and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto without any further action
thereby. In the event Ainge issues an EBITDA Statement Rejection Notice, Fox
and Ainge shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed matters in the
EBITDA Statement Rejection Notice. If, after negotiating in good faith, Fox
and Ainge remain unable to resolve the disputed matters, Fox and Ainge shall
jointly submit such dispute for resolution to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or
another independent third-party accounting firm mutually selected by the
parties (the "Accounting Firm"). The scope of the disputes to be resolved by
the Accounting Firm shall be limited to (i) whether the EBITDA Statement was
calculated in accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule B_ with
respect to matters that were submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm,
including whether the components of the AandS Business 2017 Adjusted EBITDA
derived from the Audited Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied, and (ii) whether there were mathematical errors in
the EBITDA Statement. Any disputes over the scope of the matters to be
resolved by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(c)_
shall be resolved in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.5_. The Accounting
Firms determination shall be limited to resolving the remaining
disagreements set forth in the EBITDA Statement Rejection Notice, in
accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule B_ , and the Accounting
Firm may not assign a value greater than the greatest value claimed for
an item by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The determination of the Accounting Firm and any
required adjustments resulting therefrom shall be reflected by the Accounting
Firm in the EBITDA Statement, which as so adjusted shall be final, conclusive
and binding on all of the parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the
accounting firm shall be allocated between and paid by Fox and/or Ainge,
respectively, as determined by the Accounting Firm; _provided_ that such fees
and expenses shall not include, so long as a party complies with the
procedures of this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(c)_, the other partys outside counsel
or accounting fees.

 

5.14 Non-Solicitation / No-Hire of Employees. Fox and Ainge each agree that,
except as specifically set forth below, for a period of two (2) years from and

Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of the other party,
directly or indirectly, (through its Representatives, professional search

prohibit either party from (a) making general solicitations for employment or
consulting arrangements by means of advertisements, public notices, or
internal or external websites or job search engines that are not targeting the
other party or any of its Affiliates or its or their employees (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, a party shall be entitled to hire or enter into a
consulting agreement with any Person identified through such process or who
approaches such party on his or her own initiative without any direct or
indirect solicitation by such party) or (b) hiring or entering into a
consulting agreement with any Person whose employment with such other party or

terms and conditions which are within its control in the Direct Sales
Commitment Letter. Ainge shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (subject
to Ainges right to obtain Permitted Alternative Financing in accordance with
the conditions herein) (i) use reasonable best efforts to comply with and
maintain in effect the Direct Sales Commitment Letter and negotiate and
execute definitive agreements with respect thereto, on the terms and
conditions contained therein, which terms and conditions shall not expand upon
the conditions to Closing or other contingencies to the funding (including any

and conditions contemplated in the Direct Sales Commitment Letter or the
Direct Sales Financing Agreements, or it becomes reasonably likely that such
funds may become unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth therein (in
each case other than on account of (x) any Permitted Alternative Financing
having been obtained or (y) the commitments under the Direct Sales Commitment
Letter being replaced (without reduction) with commitments set forth in the
Direct Sales Financing Agreements), Ainge shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates, to use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain as promptly as

Fox a copy (with any fee letter redacted in a customary manner to the extent
required by the applicable financing sources) of, a new financing commitment
that provides for financing in an amount that is sufficient, when added to
the portion of the Direct Sales Financing that is available, to finance the
amount set forth in the Direct Sales Commitment Letter (the "Alternative
Direct Sales Commitment Letter"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Ainge be required to pay any fees or any interest rates applicable to
the Direct Sales Financing materially in excess of those contemplated by the

conditions (including market flex) that are materially less favorable in the
aggregate to Ainge than those in the Direct Sales Commitment Letter as in
effect as of the date hereof. To the extent an

actions necessary to incur the indebtedness provided under the Direct Sales
Financing or the Alternative Direct Sales Financing, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Direct Sales Financing or the
Alternative Direct Sales Financing shall prevent, restrict or limit
the ability of any party hereto to consummate the Debt Exchange.

(b) Fox and Newco shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to

Affiliates, to use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain as promptly
as reasonably practicable any such portion from alternative sources,
including, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_ on terms that shall not expand

Financings") and to obtain (in consultation with Ainge) and, when obtained,
to provide promptly to Ainge a copy of a new financing commitment that

and containing the terms described in paragraph (b) below (the "Newco
Securities") and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Exchange to be consummated in a process to be managed by Fox (in consultation
with Ainge) in good faith, and shall keep Ainge informed of all material
developments relating thereto.

 

(b) In connection with the Debt Exchange (A) Fox (in consultation with Ainge)
shall manage the negotiations in connection with the issuance of the Newco
Securities and the selection of investment banking advisors with respect
thereto, and shall keep Ainge informed of all developments with respect
thereto and (B) the financial, legal, accounting and other advisors for Fox,
Newco and Ainge shall be directed to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do, or cause to be done, all other things reasonably necessary to
facilitate the Debt Exchange as reasonably directed by Fox in good faith. Each

are in the best interests of Ainge following the Effective Time.

(c) If the Debt Exchange is effected by means of an intermediated
exchange, (i) Fox shall be responsible for any tender or consent fees
required to buy back the related Fox indebtedness and (ii) Ainge shall be
responsible for the payments of any underwriting fees and other costs to issue
the Newco Securities (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be treated as

discount, Ainge shall reimburse Fox therefor solely to the extent such
original issue discount causes the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of cash

to be less than the sum of (x) the Basis Amount plus the Above-Basis Amount.

(d) Subject to Foxs compliance with its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 5.16_, if the Debt Exchange is not reasonably likely to be consummated at
or prior to the End Date in an amount equal to the Above-Basis Amount at
the time of the Distribution, then Fox shall, in its sole discretion, elect
in writing, not later than the latest date that would permit the Contemplated
Transactions to be consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement at or prior to the End Date to (i) require Newco to issue to
Fox the Newco Securities notwithstanding that the Debt Exchange will not be
consummated contemporaneously with the Distribution; (ii) require Newco to
draw upon and consummate the Newco Financing (or any Alternate Newco
Financing, as applicable) and, in such case, require Newco (A) to borrow an
amount up to the Above-Basis Amount (in addition to the amount borrowed
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ up to the Basis Amount) pursuant to and on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Newco Commitment Letter (or any
replacement thereof) and (B) to distribute to Fox an amount in cash equal to
the net proceeds thereof; or (iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(j)_ and pay the Fox Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_. In the case of Foxs election under clause (i)
or (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.16(d)_, the conditions set forth in
_Sections_ __ _ 6.6(a)_, and _7.6(a)_ shall be deemed waived by Ainge and
Fox, respectively, upon completion of the actions set forth in either clause
(i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. To the extent that Newco
issues to Fox Newco Securities in accordance with clause (i) of the foregoing
sentence, and Fox determines to consummate the Debt Exchange or other sale or
exchange of the Newco Securities after the Closing, Ainge and Newco shall,
following the Closing, reasonably cooperate with Fox in connection with the
preparation of all documents and the making of all filings required
in connection with such Debt Exchange or other sale or exchange of the Newco
Securities, including by taking all such other actions as are required of Fox

of-pocket third-party costs and expenses, if any, incurred in connection with
this _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)(ii)_.

5.18 DandO Indemnification and Insurance. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Ainge agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless each Person who at the Effective Time is a present or former
director or officer of any AandS Company (each a "DandO Indemnitee") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that a DandO Indemnitee was a director or officer of an AandS Company at the
request of an AandS Company at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that Fox or any of its Subsidiaries (including the AandS
Companies), as the case may be, would have been permitted under the
Organizational Documents of Newco in effect on the date hereof to indemnify
such Person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under such Organizational Documents). Without limiting the
foregoing, Ainge shall cause Newco and its Subsidiaries (i) to maintain for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in
their respective Organizational Documents concerning the indemnification and
exoneration (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the AandS
Companies respective former and current officers and directors that are no
less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the Organizational
Documents of such AandS Companies, as applicable, in each case, as of the date
hereof and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in
any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons
thereunder, in each case, except as required by any Legal Requirement;
_provided_ that no DandO Indemnitee shall be indemnified against any cost,
expense, judgment, fine, loss, claim, damage or liability in respect of any
fraud committed by such DandO Indemnitee.

 

(b) Fox shall procure, at its sole cost and expense, a prepaid, non-cancelable
six (6)-year "tail" insurance policy, endorsement or otherwise, effective as
of the Effective Time, containing terms not less favorable than the terms of
directors and officers liability insurance covering any directors and
officers of the AandS Companies who are currently covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance policies of Fox and its Subsidiaries (including
the AandS Companies) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time. If any claim is asserted or made within such six
(6)-year period, then any insurance required to be maintained under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.17(f)_ shall be continued in respect of such claim until the
final disposition thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17(f)_ shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally,
on all successors and assigns of Ainge and Newco and are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each present and former director
and officer of any AandS Company and his or her heirs and representatives. In
the event that Ainge or Newco or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Ainge or Newco, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17(f)_.

 

5.19 Certain Compensation Actions. Prior to the Closing, Ainge will take all
actions necessary, including adopting any required plan amendments, such that
the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will not result in any
"single-trigger" payment, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Ainge
Associate under any Ainge Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that Ainge
shall not be obligated under this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_ to take any such
action or adopt any such amendments that (i) are not permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements; (ii) are not permitted by the terms of the applicable
Ainge Benefit Plan to be made unilaterally and without the consent of any
other party; (iii) would reasonably be likely to result in the imposition of
Tax on any Ainge Associate under Section 409A(a)(1)(B); or (iv) would limit
any "double-trigger" protections as set forth under any Ainge Benefit Plan in
the event that the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or in connection
with any other event or circumstance) would constitute a change in control (or
term of similar import) thereunder.

condition set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be deemed to be
satisfied or waived on December 31, 2018; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Fox
has elected to take any action described in _Section_ __ _ 5.16(d)(i)_ or

7.8 Opinion and Certificates. Fox shall have received the following opinion
and certificate, each of which shall be in full force and effect:

(a) a written opinion of Skadden, or if Skadden is unwilling or unable to
issue the opinion, a written opinion of another nationally recognized law
firm or accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Fox, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Fox, dated as of the Closing Date to the effect that,
on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions set forth or
referred to in such opinion, (i) the Newco Contribution, taken together with
the Distribution, will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to Sections 355,
361 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in which no gain or loss is recognized by
Fox, except to the extent the Cash Dividend exceeds Foxs adjusted tax basis
in the Newco Common Stock and assuming Fox transfers to creditors or
distributes to shareholders the cash received in the Cash Dividend in
pursuance of the reorganization within the meaning of Section 361(b)(1) of the
Code (it being understood that the Cash Dividend does not include any
additional cash distributed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_(d)(ii)); (ii)
unless Fox shall have elected to effect the actions set forth in Section
5.16(d), the Debt Exchange will constitute a transfer of qualified property to
creditors of Fox in connection with the reorganization within the meaning of
Section 361(c)(3) of the Code; (iii) each of the Internal Distributions should
qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss pursuant to Sections 355, 361
and/or 368 of the Code, in each case for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
(iv) the Merger will be treated as a tax-free "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code in which no income, gain or loss will
be recognized by Ainge, Merger Sub, Newco or the holders of Newco Common Stock
(except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Ainge Common Stock) (such opinion, the "Fox Tax Opinion"). In rendering such
opinion, Skadden (or such other law firm or accounting firm) may rely upon
customary assumptions and representations reasonably satisfactory to it,
including representations set forth in certificates of officers of Ainge,
Merger Sub, Fox and Newco; and

(b) a certificate executed by the Chief Executive Officer of Ainge confirming
that the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ , _7.4_ and _7.9_ have
been duly satisfied.

 

7.9 No Ainge Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there
shall not have occurred any Ainge Material Adverse Effect, and no event shall
have occurred or circumstance shall exist that, in combination with any other
events or circumstances, would reasonably be expected to have or result in an
Ainge Material Adverse Effect.

Legal Requirement enacted or deemed applicable to the Merger that makes
consummation of the Merger illegal.

Proceeding in which a Governmental Body with jurisdiction over the parties is
a party: (a) challenging or seeking to restrain, prohibit, rescind or unwind
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions

any of the AandS Companies.

Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_ (or would have been entitled to

any conditions, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, each
of which is, as of such date, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were
to occur at such time and other than the conditions that cannot be satisfied
due to the failure of Ainge to so deliver such Required Ainge Financial
Information) and the Marketing Period has not ended solely because of the
failure of Ainge to deliver to the Financing Sources the Required Ainge
Financial Information which is Compliant and otherwise in satisfaction of the
other requirements in the definition of "Marketing Period"; or

(v) this Agreement is terminated by either Ainge or Fox pursuant to _Section_

breach by Ainge of the covenant set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)_ or _5.2_
and (x) after the date of this Agreement but before any such termination a

 "Ainge Termination Fee"). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (x) for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, any termination of this Agreement
under  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ by Ainge shall be deemed to be a termination
of this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ if Fox is entitled to
terminate this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ (or would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement but for Foxs inability to terminate this
Agreement as a result of any applicable waiting or notice period as prescribed
in such provisions), respectively, at the time of such termination by Ainge
and (y) in lieu of accepting the Ainge Termination Fee if payable by Ainge
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(ii)_ or _8.3(b)(iv)_ , Fox may elect by
written notice to Ainge within two (2) business days of the date this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_ or _8.1(b)_ , as
the case may be, to pursue a claim against Ainge for any breach by Ainge of
this Agreement (other than a failure to close the Contemplated Transactions
in circumstances where Ainge has complied with its obligations under _Section_
__ _ 5.15_ and any portion of the Financings were not available), in which
case the Ainge Termination Fee shall not be so payable. For the avoidance of
doubt, prior to termination of this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that
Fox shall have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Ainges obligation to
cause the Financings to be funded and Ainges obligations to effect the
consummation of the Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Ainge or Fox pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, and (A) after the date of this Agreement but before
the Ainge Stockholders Meeting a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Ainge shall have been made or communicated to Ainge or shall have been
publicly announced to or shall have become publicly known by the shareholders
of Ainge generally, and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination
Ainge shall have reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall have
consummated, such Acquisition Proposal, then Ainge shall, upon the earlier of
entry into an definitive agreement or consummation of an Acquisition Proposal,
pay Fox an amount equal to the Ainge Termination Fee less any amounts paid by
Ainge to Fox pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_, in cash by wire transfer
of same-day funds; _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (B) all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to 20% shall instead
refer to 50%.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(j)_, then Fox shall pay to Ainge a nonrefundable fee in
the amount of $40,000,000 (the "Fox Termination Fee"), in cash by wire
transfer of same-day funds concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement.

(e) Ainge shall pay to Fox its Expenses in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000
if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_. Any such
expenses due under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ shall be paid in cash by wire
transfer of same day funds no later than two (2) business days after receipt
by Ainge of an itemized statement identifying such expenses.

(f) In the event that Fox or Ainge shall be entitled to receive the Ainge
Termination Fee or the Fox Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, such fee is not a penalty but shall be liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Fox or Ainge, as applicable, in connection with the matter forming
the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree that if actually paid, then the
payments contemplated by _Sections_ __ _ 8.3(b),_ _8.3(c)_ and _8.3(e)_ shall
represent the sole and exclusive remedy of Fox in respect of a termination
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and that, except for the payment expressly
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Fox and its Affiliates shall not be
entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding
against Ainge or its Affiliates or any Financing Source, shall be precluded
from any other remedy against the other, at law or in equity or otherwise, and
shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind against
Ainge (or any partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
Subsidiary, Affiliate, agent or other representative of the Ainge Companies)
or any Financing Source in connection with or arising out of the termination
of this Agreement, any breach (whether such breach is intentional,
unintentional, willful or otherwise) of or by any party giving rise to such
termination, the failure of the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions
to be consummated, the failure by any party to perform under this Agreement
or failure by any party to perform any obligation under Law (in each case,
whether such failure is intentional,

 



79

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 unintentional, willful or otherwise); _provided_ that nothing herein shall
limit Newcos rights under the Newco Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree that if
paid, the payment contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_ represents the sole
and exclusive remedy of Ainge in respect of a termination pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and that, except for the payment expressly set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Ainge and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to
bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Fox or its
Affiliates, shall be precluded from any other remedy against the other, at
law or in equity or otherwise, and shall not seek to obtain any recovery,
judgment or damages of any kind against Fox (or any partner, member,
stockholder, director, officer, employee, Subsidiary, Affiliate, agent or
other representative of Fox or its Affiliates) in connection with or arising
out of the termination of this Agreement, any breach (whether such breach is
intentional, unintentional, willful or otherwise) of or by any party giving
rise to such termination, the failure of the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions to be consummated, the failure by any party to perform under this
Agreement or failure by any party to perform any obligation under Law (in
each case, whether such failure is intentional, unintentional, willful or
otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event Fox is not paid
the Ainge Termination Fee, nothing herein shall release Ainge from liability
for fraud or willful breach or prohibit Fox from pursuing a claim against
Ainge for breach of this Agreement as described in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and
(ii) in the event Ainge is not paid the Fox Termination Fee, nothing herein
shall release Fox from liability for fraud or willful breach or prohibit
Ainge from pursuing a claim against Fox for breach of this Agreement.

 

(g) If a party fails to pay when due any amount payable by such party under
this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, then: (i) such party shall reimburse the other
party for all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount
and the enforcement by the other party of its rights under this _Section_ __
_ 8.3_ and (ii) such party shall pay to the other party interest on such
overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount
was originally required to be paid through the date such overdue amount is
actually paid to the other party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the
lower of: (A) 350 basis points over the "prime rate" (as published by the Wall
Street Journal or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid or (B) the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Ainge in no event shall be obligated to pay more than one such Ainge
Termination Fee with respect to all such agreements and occurrences and such
termination.

(i) Without limiting the rights of Ainge and Newco under the Commitment
Letters or of Ainge, Newco or any of their respective Subsidiaries under any
Financing Agreements and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Fox agrees that none of (i) the Financing Sources or (ii) any
of the respective Affiliates of the Financing Sources or any of such Financing
Sources or their respective Affiliates respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, agents,
officers, directors, employees, accountants, advisors, or representatives or
any of their respective successors or assigns (the Persons referred to in this
clause (ii) being collectively referred to as the "Financing Source Related
Parties") shall have any liability or obligation to Fox, its stockholders or
its Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions

immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts; and (iii) that (x) the claim, action, suit or other
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum; (y) the
venue of such claim, action, suit or other proceeding is improper; or (z) this

in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent required
by law, any federal court in the State of Delaware, with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in this
paragraph. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final judgment in any such
claim, suit, action or other proceeding will be conclusive, subject to any
appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or

irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief to

9.9 Cooperation. Ainge and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Fox and Newco, on
the other hand, agree to cooperate fully with Fox and Newco and Ainge and

certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may

 9.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement (or part thereof)

not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms
and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any other situation or in any
other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement (or part thereof) is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision (or part
thereof), to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision (or part thereof), and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with
a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.

 

9.11 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of Fox, Newco, Ainge and
Merger Sub acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions. Accordingly, any rule that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents against the drafting party has no application and
is expressly waived.
