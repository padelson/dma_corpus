the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the applicable authorities all
applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes due in connection with
the settlement and cancellation of all such Options.   (a) Notwithstanding
SECTION 3.4(A) above, Options held by Michael T. Riordan to acquire 266,000
shares of Common Stock as of the date hereof shall be settled and cancelled
on or prior to December 31, 2001 by payment by the Company to Mr. Riordan of
an amount in cash for each such Option equal to (i) the product of (a) the
excess of the Price Per Share over the exercise price of such Option,
multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Option
less (ii) the amount of all applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes in connection with the cash payment made in settlement and cancellation
of such Option, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Option or portion of an Option may
be settled and cancelled or otherwise accelerated prior to the date on which
such Option or portion of an Option shall become vested pursuant to Section 2
of the Option Agreement between the Company and Mr. Riordan, dated as of May
4, 2000.   - 10 -     3.5 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each share of Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a
stockholder (a "DISSENTING HOLDER") who has properly exercised and perfected
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "DISSENTING SHARES"),
shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the
Price Per Share, but shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving
Corporation such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, after the Effective Time, such
holder shall have effectively withdrawn, waived or lost the right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, each share of Common Stock of such
holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation
the Price Per Share, without any interest thereon.   3.6 EXCHANGE OF COMPANY
CAPITAL.   (a) PAYING AGENT. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for the payment of all amounts payable
as a result of the Merger to the holders of Certificates (the aggregate
amount payable to holders of Certificates is referred to as the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION"). As necessary from time to time following the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Sub shall transfer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts established by the Paying Agent for
the purposes of paying all Merger Consideration, an amount equal to all
Merger Consideration which will be payable following the Effective Time to
the holders of Certificates. Any and all interest or income earned on funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned
over to Parent. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Paying
Agent.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE FOR CERTIFICATES. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares
formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to SECTION 3.2 into the right to receive, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, together with any signature guarantee as may
reasonably be requested by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and
the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not   - 11 -    applicable. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.   3.7 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMMON STOCK. All cash
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this ARTICLE 3.   3.8 NO LIABILITY. None of Guarantor,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Sellers or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  
3.9 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any applicable taxes from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Certificates. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.   ARTICLE 4   INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND  WARRANTIES OF EACH

subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent
the concept of good standing exists in the applicable jurisdiction) in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite corporate or other power and authority necessary to own, lease and
operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect. A list of all subsidiaries of the Company together
with the jurisdiction of organization of each such subsidiary and the
percentage of each such subsidiary\'s outstanding capital stock owned by the
Company or another subsidiary of the Company is contained in Schedule 5.1.
Except as set forth in Schedule 5.1 or the Company SEC Documents, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity or

DOCUMENTS"). All such Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary Documents are

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or
equivalent organizational documents, except for violations of the documents
of subsidiaries which do not and are not reasonably likely to materially
interfere with the operations of such entity or to have a Material Adverse

intercompany book entry transactions, in either case entered into in the
ordinary course of business. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.3(b), the

in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or impair the
Company\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' rights or alter the rights or
obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of, or
cause any, termination, amendment, redemption, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on (including a right

regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade ("NON-U.S. MONOPOLY LAWS"), (d) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its material obligations under this Agreement, or would not
otherwise reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material   - 16 -    Adverse Effect, and (e) as to which any necessary

of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain all
the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the Company
Charter Documents on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended,
modified or otherwise repealed for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder as of
the Effective Time of individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless such
modification is required after the Effective Time by law and then only to the
minimum extent required by such law.   (a) The Surviving Corporation shall,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law or under the Surviving
Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation or by-laws, indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against
any costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, (x) arising out of or pertaining
to the Contemplated Transactions or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the same extent as
provided in the Company Charter Documents or any applicable contract or
agreement as in effect on the date hereof, in each case for a period of six
years after the Effective Time. In the event of any such   - 41
-    claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time) and subject to the specific terms of
any indemnification contract, (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties for any period after the Effective Time shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, (ii) after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received; PROVIDED that the
Indemnified Parties shall be required to reimburse the Surviving Corporation
for such payments in the circumstances and to the extent required by the
Company Charter Documents, any applicable contract or agreement or applicable
law; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld); and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, in the
event that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made
within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue until the disposition of any and all such
claims. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to
represent them in each applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single
action unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict (as reasonably determined by such Indemnified Party\'s counsel) on
any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties, in which case each Indemnified Party with respect to whom such a
conflict exists (or group of such Indemnified Parties who among them have no
such conflict) may retain one separate law firm in each
applicable jurisdiction.   (b) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and
fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to
indemnification agreements and employment agreements (the employee parties
under such agreements being referred to as the "COVERED PERSONS") with the

provided that they have not been entered into in violation of the terms of
this Agreement.   (c) In addition, Parent shall provide, or cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time, the Company\'s current directors and officers with
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO; INSURANCE") that is no
less favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO; Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall
purchase as much such coverage as possible for such amount.   (d) This
SECTION 8.4 shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective
Time, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the

successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and shall be enforceable
by the Indemnified Parties and the Covered Persons. From and after the

of all funds owing by, and the timely performance of all other obligations
of, the Surviving Corporation under this SECTION 8.4.   8.5 ACCOUNTANT\'S
LETTER. Upon reasonable notice from the other, the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP to deliver to Parent a letter

Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate

EMPLOYEE MATTERS.   (a) From the Effective Time through June 30, 2002
(the "BENEFITS CONTINUATION PERIOD"), the Surviving Corporation shall provide
each person who, as of the Effective Time, is an employee of the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company (a "COMPANY EMPLOYEE") with salary and
employee benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, subject to applicable law, contractual restrictions and the last
sentence of this SECTION 8.7(A), that the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to amend any Company Employee Plans, including without limitation,
any retiree welfare benefit plans or pension benefit plans, in effect as of
the Effective Time (provided that employee benefits remain comparable as
described above). Prior to the Closing Date the Company may amend the Paragon
Trade Brands, Inc. Severance Plan with the approval of Parent. During the
Benefits Continuation Period, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain severance plans, policies and programs for the benefit of each
Company Employee that are at least as favorable as the plans, policies and
programs applicable to such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, without amendment or modification adverse to any such employee.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for one year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to maintain the Paragon Trade Brands, Inc. Severance Plan as in
existence immediately prior to the Closing Date without amendment
or modification adverse to any participant therein.   (b) After the
Benefits Continuation Period Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Company Employees with employee benefits that are
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the Surviving
Corporation shall have no obligation to provide Company Employees with post-
termination welfare or pension benefits, except to the extent required by
applicable law or contractual agreement.   (c) With respect to the benefits
provided pursuant to this SECTION 8.7, Parent shall take all necessary
actions, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take all necessary
actions, to provide that (i) service accrued by Company Employees during
employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (including any predecessor
entity) prior to the Effective Time shall be recognized for all purposes,
except for benefit accruals with respect to defined benefit pension plans,
(ii) any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such
limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under the applicable
Company Employee Plan) and eligibility waiting periods under any group health
plan shall be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their
eligible dependents, and (iii) Company Employees shall be given credit for
amounts paid under a Company Employee Plan during the applicable period for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket   - 43
-    maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the employee welfare plans in which any Company
Employee becomes entitled to participate.   (d) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor in accordance with their terms all benefits and obligations under the
Company Employee Plans and consulting agreements, including without
limitation each employment, retirement, severance and change in control
agreement, plan or arrangement, each as in effect on the date of this
Agreement (or as amended as contemplated hereby or with the prior written
consent of Parent); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that it is the understanding of the
parties hereto that the aforementioned agreements, plans and arrangements
do not provide duplicative benefits and that other than the last sentence
of SECTION 8.7(A) or as otherwise provided herein, nothing herein shall
prevent the Surviving Corporation or any other subsidiary of Guarantor from
amending or modifying any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement in
any respect in accordance with its terms or, subject to the terms of the
Company Employee Plans (as so amended or modified, if applicable),
terminating or modifying the terms and conditions of employment or other
service of any particular employee or any other person, except in any such
case as precluded by law or the terms of a Company Employee Plan.   (e) It
is expressly agreed that the provisions of this SECTION 8.7 are not intended
to be for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third party,
including, without limitation, any Company Employees.   (f) The Company
represents and warrants as of the date hereof that it has amended its 401(k)
savings plan and any other Company Employee Plan which permits participants
to elect to invest in stock of the Company, where necessary, to preclude any
additional purchases of stock of the Company and the Company has communicated
this amendment to the participants in such plans. Furthermore, between the
date of such amendment and the Effective Time, the Company shall not have
amended or amend its 401(k) savings plan or any other Company Employee Plan
in any way that would make any representation contained in the immediately
preceding sentence false if made as of any time between the date thereof and
the Effective Time.   (g) If the Closing shall occur prior to March 1,
2002, and the fiscal 2001 bonuses earned under the Company\'s Performance
Incentive Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"BONUS PLAN") have not been paid at the time of the Closing, then following
the Closing Date, but no later than March 1, 2002, Parent shall pay, or cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay, to Company Employees their fiscal 2001
bonuses earned under the Bonus Plan (the date of such payment is referred to
herein as the "2001 BONUS PAYMENT DATE"). Further, with respect to any
Company Employee whose employment is terminated following the end of the 2001
fiscal year and prior to the 2001 Bonus Payment Date, Parent shall pay, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, to such Company Employee, if
the bonus has not already been paid, on or before the 2001 Bonus Payment Date
a bonus for the 2001 fiscal year equal to the bonus that such Company
Employee would have received under the Bonus Plan if not for such termination
of employment. Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall pay to Michael T.
Riordan on or prior to December 31, 2001 an amount in cash equal to $900,000,
in satisfaction of Mr. Riordan\'s bonus under the Bonus Plan for fiscal year
2001.   - 44 -     8.8 WARRANTS. Following the Effective Time, and
within the period specified by the Warrant Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub

Article 3 of the Warrant Agreement, and (ii) pay the Call Price (calculated
as set forth in the Warrant Agreement and using the Per Share Price as the
Current Market Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement)) to the holders of
such outstanding Warrants as required under the terms of the Warrant
Agreement. This SECTION 8.8 is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by,
the holders of Warrants issued under the Warrant Agreement event though such
holders are not party to this Agreement.   8.9 CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in
negotiating an arrangement reasonably acceptable to Parent regarding the
transfer of employees presently working in the Company\'s manufacturing

interest in PMI.   8.10 SAP SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents or approval required
or convenient in respect of the SAP Settlement Agreements or any other
contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) and The Procter and
Gamble Company or between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) and
Kimberly-Clark Corporation or Kimberly-Clark Worldwide; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
failure to obtain any such consent or approval (despite the exercise of such
efforts as are required hereby) shall not constitute, or be deemed to
constitute, a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement or the failure to satisfy any condition contained
in ARTICLE 9 of this Agreement.   ARTICLE 9   CONDITIONS   9.1
