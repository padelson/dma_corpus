Law. The officers and directors of the Company and the Buyer in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers and directors
of the Surviving Entity effective as of the Effective Time, as set forth on
Schedule 2.4 hereto.

  

2.5 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger (and without any action on the part of Buyer or the Company)
the shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company (each,
a "Common Share" and, collectively, the "Common Shares") and the outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock of the
Company (each a "Preferred Share" and, collectively, the "Preferred
Shares" and, together with the Common Shares, the "Shares") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, collectively, be
converted into the right to receive the Common Consideration, or, at the
election of any holder of Shares, the Preferred Consideration. The "Common
Consideration" is the aggregate consideration consisting of shares of Common
Stock. The "Preferred Consideration" is the aggregate consideration consisting
of Parent Series C Preferred Stock, the terms of which are set forth in a

the holders of Series A Preferred Stock;

  

(c) Five Million Six Hundred Thousand One Hundred and Fifty (5,600,150)
shares of Common Stock shall be issued to the holders of Series B

Hundred and Forty Five (45,454,545) shares of Common Stock shall be issued to

($10,000,000) Dollars of the Company's securities (the "Company
Financing") pursuant to which Laidlaw and Company (UK), Ltd. ("Laidlaw") served
as placement agent, based on a 1:1 ratio with each Common Share of the
Company held by a Company Laidlaw Investor entitled to receive one share of
Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, less than 45,454,545 shares of
Common Stock may be issued to the Company Laidlaw Investors pursuant to
this section (i) in the event less than $10,000,000 is raised in the Company

and the Company;

  

(e) A minimum of Four Million (4,000,000) shares and a maximum of Seven
Million (7,000,000) shares of Common Stock shall be issued to Laidlaw
based on the gross proceeds received by the Company in the Company Financing,
calculated on a share for dollar basis. By way of example, if the Company
receives $5 million in gross proceeds in the Company Financing, Laidlaw shall
receive Five Million (5,000,000) shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, provided the Company receives at least $6 million in gross proceeds
from the Company Financing, Laidlaw shall be entitled to receive Seven
Million (7,000,000) shares of Common Stock. Additionally, Laidlaw shall
be issued warrants (the "Laidlaw Warrants") to purchase shares of Common
Stock, in such form and with such terms and pricing as shall be mutually
agreed upon between the Company and Parent prior to Closing. The number of
shares of Common Stock into which the Laidlaw Warrants to be issued will be
exercisable shall equal 7.5% of the total dollar amount raised in the
Company Financing; and

  

(f) Five Million Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,550,000) shares of
Common Stock shall be issued to the holders of Common Shares of the
Company issued in connection with the closing of the Keystone Acquisition
(each, a "Keystone Holder") the receipt of which shall be conditioned on the
receipt of a Lockup Agreement (as defined below) from each Keystone Holder.

  

The Company Stockholder Consideration, in the aggregate and on an "as
converted" basis, shall not exceed One Hundred and Twenty Three Million, Six
Hundred and Four Thousand Six Hundred and Ninety Five (123,604,695) shares of
Common Stock and Laidlaw Warrants to purchase up to Seven Hundred and Fifty
Thousand (750,000) shares of Common Stock. __

consultant of a two year lockup agreement, the form of which is attached
hereto as __Exhibit C__ (the "Lockup Agreement").

  



  

2.7 _Exchange of Shares for Merger Consideration_. At the Effective
Time, the Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously evidencing
any such Shares (the "Certificates") shall thereafter represent the right to
receive only the Merger Consideration.

  

2.8 _Buyer Common Stock_. Each share of Buyer common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, held by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parent, be converted into the right to receive one (1) share of common stock
of the Surviving Entity.

the Merger Consideration, any certificates or book entry records of the Shares
shall forthwith be cancelled.

cancellation of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.

transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Entity of the Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by

with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect thereto.

of shares of capital stock of the Company constituting the Company

Company Stockholder Consideration issuable to the Stockholder in shares of
Parent Series C Preferred Stock (the "Escrow Shares"); and (ii) to the
stockholders of the Company, the remaining Merger Consideration (the "Non-
Escrow Shares"). The Escrow Shares shall be available to secure any claims
that may arise with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants or
indemnification obligations of the Stockholder and the Company pursuant to
this Agreement during the escrow period ("Escrow Period") of twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date. In addition, to the extent the Parent or
the Company obtains a new preliminary economic report

the New Report shows a lower economic value for the Copper King Project then
that economic value shown in that certain preliminary economic report on the
Copper King Project dated August 24, 2012 and undertaken by Mine Development

reimburse the Parent for such decline in value, by the forfeiture of
such shares, in accordance with the valuation of such Escrow Shares set forth
in the Escrow Agreement. In __ no event shall the indemnification obligations
of the Stockholder under this Agreement exceed the Escrow Shares. The Escrow

liability shall collectively exceed $10,000 (the "Threshold"), whereupon the
Losses exceeding the Threshold shall be payable by the Stockholder;

    

28

 



    



  

(ii) Parent waives, on behalf of itself and any Parent Indemnified
Party, any right to multiply actual damages or recover consequential,
indirect, special, punitive or exemplary damages (including, without
limitation, damages for lost profits or loss of business opportunity) arising
in connection with or with respect to the indemnification provisions hereof or
any right to recovery from any source other than the Escrow Shares _._ For
the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder's indemnification obligation is
limited to the Escrow Shares.

  

(iii) In no event shall the Stockholder's aggregate liability to any
Indemnified Party under _Section 8.1_ exceed the after tax amount of such
Claim and all Claims shall be net of any insurance proceeds reasonably
expected to be received in respect of Losses subject to such Claim. The
Parent Indemnified Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts available under applicable insurance policies with respect to Losses
subject to a Claim.

  

8.2 _Obligations of Parent_. Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Entity
(collectively, the "Parent Indemnifying Parties") agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Stockholder and its agents, representatives and Affiliates and
its successors and assigns (each, a "Stockholder Indemnified Party") from and
against any and all Losses of the Stockholder Indemnified Party, directly or
indirectly, as a result of, or based upon or arising from:

  

(a) the ownership, management and operation of the Company and the
Surviving Entity after the Closing Date, except (a) to the extent any such

liability under _Section 8.2_  exceed the after-tax amount of such Claims.

  

8.3 _Procedure_. A Stockholder Indemnified Party or a Parent
Indemnified Party (each, an "Indemnified Party") shall give the Parent
Indemnifying Party or Stockholder Indemnifying Party (each, an "Indemnifying
Party"), as applicable, notice (a "Claim Notice") of any matter which an
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (a "Claim"), within forty-five
(45) days of such determination; provided, however, that any failure of the
Indemnified Party to provide such Claim Notice shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation
or liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise than under
this Article VIII except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. Upon receipt of the Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense
of such Claim at its expense if it gives notice of its intention to do so to
the Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of such
Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that (i)
Indemnified Party must approve of the selection of legal counsel by
Indemnifying Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned and (ii) if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a
conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the
Indemnified Party, in its reasonable discretion, for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required,
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Claim as
provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying

    

29

 



    



  

Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly
or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such
Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned so long as (a) there is no payment or other
consideration required of the Indemnified Party and (b) such settlement does
not require or otherwise involve any restrictions on the conduct of
Business by the Indemnified Party.

contained in this Agreement, including the Exhibits and the Schedules to this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing until the first (1st) anniversary of the

indemnification payment hereunder unless a Claim is delivered to the
Indemnifying Party on or before 5:00 p.m. ET of the one year anniversary of
the Closing Date, except with respect to Claims of fraud committed by the
Indemnifying Party.

  

(b) Any matter as to which a Claim has been asserted by a Claim Notice
to the other party that is pending or unresolved at the end of any
applicable limitation period shall continue to be covered by this Article
VIII notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations (which the parties
hereby waive) until such matter is finally terminated or otherwise resolved by
the parties under this Agreement or by a final, nonappealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction and any amounts payable hereunder are finally
determined and paid.

  

8.5 _Notice by Indemnifying Party_. The Indemnifying Party agrees to
notify the Indemnified Party of any liabilities, claims or
misrepresentations, breaches or other matters covered by this Article VIII
upon discovery or receipt of notice thereof (other than such claims from the
Indemnified Party).

  

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy._ Other than rights to equitable relief, to the
extent available under applicable law, each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses arising from Claims
described in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_  or any other Claims of every nature
arising in any manner in connection with this Agreement, shall be

policies and good commercial practice, to mitigate such Losses.
