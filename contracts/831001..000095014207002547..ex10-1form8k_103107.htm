  **Share Exchange Agreement**

  



  

  CITIGROUP JAPAN HOLDINGS  LTD., a _kabushiki  kaisha_ having its offices
at 3-1, Marunouchi 1-chome,  Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0005, Japan  (" **CJH**
"), and  NIKKO CORDIAL CORPORATION,  a _kabushiki kaisha_ having its 
offices at 6-5 Nihonbashi Kabuto-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 103-8225, Japan  ("
**NCC** "), hereby execute  the following Share Exchange Agreement as of
October 31, 2007 (hereinafter referred to  as the " **Agreement** "). CJH 
is a wholly-owned first-tier subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., a Delaware
corporation  (" **Citigroup** ").

  

  **Article 1 (Share  Exchange)**

  



  

  CJH and NCC shall execute a share-for-share exchange as a result of  which
CJH shall become the absolute parent company of NCC and NCC shall become a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of CJH (the " **Share  Exchange** "). As a
consequence of the Share Exchange, CJH  shall acquire the entire issued stock
of NCC, except the stock of NCC owned by CJH, in  exchange for shares of
common stock of Citigroup (the  " **Citigroup Shares** ") in  the manner
described in Article 2 below.

  

  **Article 2 (Shares to be Delivered in  Share Exchange and
Allotment)**

  



  

  2.1   Upon the execution of the Share Exchange, CJH shall
deliver to the  shareholders of NCC (including beneficial shareholders, but
excluding CJH), as entered  or recorded in the shareholders' register of NCC
(hereinafter including the  beneficial shareholders' register) as of the time
(the  " **Reference Time** ")  immediately preceding the time when CJH
acquires the entire issued stock of NCC (except  the stock of NCC already
owned by CJH), the number of Citigroup Shares obtained  by _multiplying_ the
total number of  shares of common stock of NCC owned by the shareholders of
NCC (excluding CJH) as  entered or recorded in the shareholders' register of
NCC as of the Reference Time  (" **NCC Shares** ")  _by_ the Exchange
Shares.  " **Exchange Shares** " means,  with respect to each NCC Share, the
number of Citigroup Shares into which such NCC  Share will be exchanged,
calculated in accordance with the following  formula:

  

  Exchange Shares = Â¥ 1,700 /((Citigroup Average Price)(Exchange  Rate)),
_where_

  

  " **Citigroup Average  Price** " means the average of the volume-
weighted  average prices per Citigroup Share on the New York Stock Exchange
on each of the  trading days in the Valuation Period; _provided  that_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Citigroup Average  Price as so
determined is greater than $58.00, then the Citigroup Average Price shall  be
$58.00, and if the Citigroup Average Price as so determined is less than
$37.00,  then the Citigroup Average Price shall be $37.00 (such share prices
to be adjusted, if  applicable, for any Capital Transaction);

  



  
   

  **< English Translation>**

  



  



  

  " **Valuation  Period** " means the period commencing on (and including) 
January 15, 2008 and ending on (and including) January 17, 2008, Eastern
Standard  Time;

  

  " **Exchange  Rate** " means the average of the mean of the exchange 
rate quotations for buying and selling spot dollars in Tokyo by telegraphic
transfer  against Japanese yen, as quoted by The Bank of Tokyo--Mitsubishi
UFJ, Ltd. (or, if  it does not provide such quotations, Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corporation), expressed as  a number of yen per one U.S. dollar, as
of 11:00 a.m. (Tokyo time) on each of the  Business Days from January 15,
2008 (inclusive) to January 17, 2008  (inclusive).

  

  " **Business  Day** " means a day on which banks are open for business 
in both Tokyo, Japan and New York, New York, U.S.A.

  

  Exchange Shares shall be calculated to the extent of thousandths of a 
Citigroup Share, rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.002 (rounded up in the
case of  equidistant rounded numbers).

  

  2.2   Upon the execution of the Share Exchange, CJH shall allot
to each  shareholder of NCC (including beneficial shareholders, but excluding
CJH) as entered or  recorded in the shareholders' register of NCC as of the
Reference Time a number  of Citigroup Shares equal to the product of the
Exchange Shares and the number of NCC  Shares owned by such shareholder as
entered or recorded in the shareholders'  register of NCC as of the Reference
Time.

  

  2.3   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Capital Transaction
occurs as of a  record date during or after the Valuation Period but before
the Effective Date (as  defined in Article 3 below, hereinafter the same
shall apply), the Exchange Shares  shall be adjusted proportionately to the
relevant ratio of such Capital Transaction,  and if a Capital Transaction
occurs as of a record date during the Valuation Period the  volume-weighted
average price per Citigroup Share for all trading days within the  Valuation
Period prior to such record date shall be adjusted proportionately to such 
relevant ratio, in each case so as to put NCC shareholders in the same
position that  they would have been in had such Capital Transaction not taken
place. A  " **Capital Transaction** "  means a stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split or similar transaction in  connection with the Citigroup
Shares that would reasonably require an adjustment of the  formula set out in
Article 2.1 hereof. In addition, if a cash dividend is declared as  of a
record date during January 2008 before the Effective Date, an appropriate 
adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Shares to reflect the diminution in
value of  the Citigroup Shares delivered at the Effective Date as a result of
the dividend  declaration.

  

  2.4   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of Citigroup
Shares that  would be delivered to any NCC shareholder upon the Effective
Date includes a fraction  of less than one, CJH shall deliver to such
shareholder an amount of cash  (" _hasu-choseikin_ ")  equal, rounded as
necessary up to the nearest whole yen, to the product of such  fraction and
the Market Price in lieu of the number of Citigroup Shares equal  to

  



  

  2

  
   

  **< English Translation>**

  



  

such  fraction. For the purpose of this paragraph, " **Market  Price** "
shall mean the price per Citigroup Share in the  last sales transaction which
is made prior to the day immediately before the Effective  Date (US Eastern
Standard Time) on the New York Stock Exchange, converted into Japanese  yen,
rounded as necessary up to the nearest whole yen, at the mean of the last
exchange  rate quotations for buying and selling spot dollars in Tokyo by
telegraphic transfer  against Japanese yen, as quoted immediately before the
Effective Date by The Bank of  Tokyo--Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (or, if it does
not provide such quotations, Sumitomo  Mitsui Banking Corporation).

  

  **Article 3 (Effective  Date)**

  



  

  The date on which the Share Exchange shall become effective (hereinafter 
referred to as the " **Effective  Date** ") shall be January 29, 2008.

  

  **Article 4 (General  Meeting for Approval of the Share Exchange)**

  



  

  4.1   NCC shall convene an extraordinary general meeting of
shareholders,  scheduled to be held on December 19, 2007 (the  "
**Shareholders Meeting** "),  and submit an agenda at the Shareholders
Meeting permitting a vote on this Agreement  and the resolution of any
matters which shall be necessary to execute the Share  Exchange, provided,
however, that such schedule may be modified upon consultation and  agreement
between CJH and NCC in the event such modification is necessary under the 
applicable procedural requirements for the Share Exchange or other reasons.

  

  4.2   CJH shall convene and seek its shareholder's approval of
the Share  Exchange at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of
CJH scheduled to be  held prior to the Effective Date. CJH represents and
warrants to NCC that Citigroup,  its sole shareholder, has agreed to vote in
favor of the Share Exchange at such  meeting.

  

  **Article 5 (Limitation  on Distribution of Surplus)**

  



  

  NCC shall not declare or pay any dividend on the NCC Shares, after the 
dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, while the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement are pending. The parties acknowledge that
those who received  Citigroup Shares in the Share Exchange and keep holding
them will be entitled to  receive dividends declared on the Citigroup Shares
as of any record date after the  Effective Date.

  

  **Article 6 (Management  of Company Property, etc.)**

  



  

  6.1   From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Date, NCC
shall  conduct its business and manage and operate its property with the duty
of care and  diligence of a good manager, in accordance with its ordinary and
usual practice, and in  substantially the same manner as customarily
conducted, and if NCC intends to engage in  any course of action which may
have a material impact on its property, rights or  obligations, such course
of action may only be performed after consultation with CJH  and having
received its consent thereto. From the date of this Agreement to the 
Effective Date, NCC shall not issue or allot any new NCC Shares or share
purchase  warrants ( _shinkabu yoyaku-ken_ ) or  dispose of any treasury
shares or share purchase warrants unless required by law or  the

  **< English Translation>**

  



  

terms  of NCC share purchase warrants  ( _shinkabu-yoyaku-ken_ ) or rights
to  purchase shares  ( _shinkabu-hikiuke-ken_ ), or split its  shares.

  

  6.2   From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Date, CJH
shall conduct  its business and manage and operate its property in such a
manner as will not in any  way interfere with its ability to consummate the
Share Exchange and fulfill its other  obligations under this Agreement. CJH
represents and warrants that as of the Effective  Date it will own
beneficially and of record sufficient Citigroup Shares, without any  security
interests or other encumbrances, to deliver all Citigroup Shares to be
issued  in the Share Exchange in accordance with Article 2.1.

  

  6.3   With respect to the starting date of maintenance of
absorbing merger  agreement and others ( _kyushugappei-keiyaku-to 
bichikaishi-bi_ ), NCC shall cause Article 782, Paragraph 2,  Item 1 of the
Corporate Law to apply to the Share Exchange unless otherwise agreed  between
CJH and NCC.

  

  **Article 7 (Termination  of Agreement)**

  



  

  7.1   Upon the occurrence of any material event beyond the
reasonable control  of either party hereto that makes the completion of the
Share Exchange impossible or  impracticable, this Agreement may be modified
or terminated upon mutual written  agreement of both parties hereto after
mutual consultation.

  

  7.2   If after October 2, 2007 there has been a change or event
that has had,  or is reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on
the business, financial  condition or results of operations of NCC and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole,  excluding changes in economic conditions
affecting market participants generally, CJH  and NCC may modify the terms
and conditions of the Share Exchange upon consultation and  mutual agreement
or CJH may terminate this Agreement by written notice to NCC;  _provided_
that if the convocation notice for  the Shareholders Meeting has been sent to
NCC shareholders, any modifications shall  either (x) be to the extent
permitted without sending a new convocation notice or (y)  require the
transmittal of a new convocation notice reflecting such  modifications.

  

  7.3   If the Citigroup Average Price as determined without giving
effect to  the proviso contained in the definition thereof is below $26.00
(adjusted, if  applicable, for any Capital Transaction), then within two
Business Days after the end  of the Valuation Period NCC may terminate this
Agreement by written notice to  CJH.

  

  **Article 8 (Effectiveness  of this Agreement)**

of the Share Exchange by the Shareholders Meeting or the competent authorities
as  required by applicable laws and regulations is not obtained, and the
