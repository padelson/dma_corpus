MENDMENT TO ACQUISITION AGREEMENT     
EXHIBIT 2.5   FIRST AMENDMENT  TO  ACQUISITION AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER  ----------------------------------------   This First Amendment to
Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "First Amendment") is dated
August 9, 2000 by and among Entravision Communications Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), Entravision Communications Company,
L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), and ZSPN
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition Co."), on the
one hand, and Z-Spanish Media Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("ZSPN"),
and the individuals and entities set forth on the signature pages hereto, who
are stockholders of ZSPN owning approximately seventy-nine percent (79%) of
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of ZSPN as of the Execution
Date (the "Major Stockholders"), on the other hand, with respect to the
following facts:   WHEREAS, the parties hereto have previously entered into
that certain Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 20, 2000
(the "Original Agreement"), pursuant to which Acquisition Co. is to merge
with and into ZSPN (the "Merger"), which shall be the Surviving Corporation.
Following the Merger, ZSPN will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Corporation.   WHEREAS, the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC")
has consented to the assignment by Z-Spanish Media Licensing Company, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of ZSPN to Salinas
Holdings Partnership, a Connecticut partnership ("Salinas Holdings") of the
FCC Licenses for radio stations KZSA (FM) in Placerville, California; KRAY-FM
in Salinas, California; KZSF (AM) in San Jose, California; KSQR (AM) in
Sacramento, California; KZSL (FM) in King City, California; KHNZ (FM) in
Soledad, California; and K277AH, Watsonville, California, (individually a
"DOJ Excluded Station" and collectively, the "DOJ Excluded Stations"); and
radio stations KHMZ(FM) in Salinas, California; KTGE(AM) in Salinas,
California; KCTY(AM) in Salinas, California; and KLOC(AM) in Ceres,
California, (individually a " FCC Excluded Station" and collectively, the
"FCC Excluded Stations").   WHEREAS, the FCC has approved the assignment of
the Licenses for the FCC Excluded Stations to the Z-Spanish Trust created
under that certain trust agreement dated August 8, 2000 (the "Z-Spanish Trust
I").   WHEREAS, Salinas Holdings has agreed to file an application with the
FCC to request consent to assign the licenses for the DOJ Excluded Stations
to the Z- Spanish Trust II created under that certain Trust Agreement dated
August 7, 2000 (the "Z-Spanish Trust II").   WHEREAS, under the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules, regulations and
policies of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") (collectively,
the "Communications Act"), the FCC has raised certain objections to the
ownership by the Corporation of the FCC Excluded Stations.    WHEREAS, the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") has raised certain objections with respect
to the acquisition by the Corporation of the DOJ Excluded Stations.  
WHEREAS, in order to address both the FCC\'s and the DOJ\'s concerns and
to consummate the Merger in a timely fashion, the FCC Licenses for the FCC
and DOJ Excluded Stations will be transferred to Salinas Holdings immediately
before the Closing, and then to the Z-Spanish Trust I and the Z-Spanish Trust
II, as appropriate, upon receipt of FCC consent for such assignment, pursuant
to the Trust Agreements. For the same reasons, until DOJ and FCC stations are
assigned to Entravision or sold or transferred and the licenses assigned to a
third party, all rights, title and interest in the assets used exclusively
for the DOJ and FCC Excluded Stations shall be placed in trust immediately
following the Effective Time of the Merger with the Z-Spanish Trust II.  
WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated August 7, 2000, and
subject to DOJ\'s and FCC\'s approval, the Corporation has agreed, on
the conditions set forth therein, to reacquire the Assets of the DOJ
Excluded Stations to be managed by Salinas Holdings or the Z-Spanish II Trust
and the Trustee thereof.   WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend the
Original Agreement as set forth herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
of the mutual covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged by each
signatory hereto, it is agreed as follows:   1. All capitalized terms used
in this First Amendment and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning
ascribed to such terms in the Original Agreement. The recitals of this First
Amendment are incorporated herein by this reference.   2. Schedule "A" of
the Original Agreement (which was inadvertently  ------------ omitted) shall
be amended to read in full with regard to ZSPN\'s radio stations and Internet
sites as set forth on Schedule "A-1" to this First Amendment. 
-------------- Schedule A-2 shall list ZSPN\'s Billboard assets.   3.
Section 1.33 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to read in full as
follows:   "1.33. "Exchange Agreement" shall mean that certain Amended and 
Restated Exchange Agreement dated effective as of July 24, 2000 by and  among
the Company, its members and Univision Communications Inc. attached  to this
First Amendment as Exhibit "A-1" and incorporated herein by this 
-------------  reference."   4. Section 1.74 of the Original Agreement is
hereby amended to read in full as follows:   -2-    "1.74. "Registration
Statement" shall mean the Corporation\'s final  prospectus filed with the SEC
prior to the date of this First Amendment in  connection with the IPO which
has been made available to the Stockholders  and their counsel."   5.
Section 2.7 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to read in full as
follows:   "2.7 Acquisition Consideration.  -------------------------  
(a) Fixed Consideration. The aggregate fixed consideration to be 
-------------------  paid in any event in the Merger for the Shares shall be
an amount equal to  $339,829,614, less the sum of the following additional
consideration for  the Merger (i) the Option Roll-Over Amount, (ii) the
Termination Payments,  (iii) the TSG Loan and (iv) an amount equal to
$1,750,000 (the "Escrow  Amount") to be used by the ZSPN Representatives to
pay for costs and  expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this  Original Agreement and this First Amendment, including
expenses incurred in  connection with disposition of the FCC Excluded
Stations and the DOJ  Excluded Stations (the "ZSPN Fixed Equity
Consideration"). The ZSPN Fixed  Equity Consideration shall be paid as
follows: (i) $220,719,752 in cash  (the "Cash Consideration Value"), plus
(ii) 7,187,902 newly-issued shares  of Class A Common Stock of the
Corporation (the "Stock Consideration  Value"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Cash Consideration Value shall  be reduced on a dollar-for-
dollar basis for all amounts of ZSPN  Indebtedness in excess of $108,670,117
incurred by ZSPN after receipt of  Entravision\'s written consent pursuant to
Section 7.2 below and not repaid  prior to the Closing. References to ZSPN
Equity Consideration in the  Original Agreement shall be deemed to be amended
to refer to ZSPN Fixed  Equity Consideration as defined in this Section
2.7(a).   (b) Contingent Consideration. Following the Closing, the 
------------------------  Corporation shall pay additional contingent cash
consideration (the  "Contingent Cash Consideration") as follows:   (i) An
amount of Contingent Cash Consideration equal to  fifty percent (50%) of the
cash actually received in connection with the  sale of the FCC Excluded
Stations after payment of or provision for all  costs and expenses incurred
by or on behalf of the Corporation or its  Affiliates in connection with such
sale, including, without limitation,  commissions, trustee fees and
professional fees (the "Net Cash Proceeds").   (ii) An amount of Contingent
Cash Consideration equal to all  Net Cash Proceeds actually received by The
Z-Spanish II Trust in connection  with the sale of any of the DOJ Excluded
Stations to third parties.   -3-    (iii) If the DOJ approves the
retention of any or all of the  DOJ Excluded Stations by the Corporation or
any of its Affiliates, the  Corporation shall pay additional Contingent Cash
Consideration in the  amount of the Agreed Value (as defined below) of each
such station. If the  DOJ approves the retention of any such station by the
Corporation or its  Affiliates within ninety (90) days after the Closing of
the Merger, the  Agreed Value will be as set forth on Exhibit "B-1" hereto.
If the DOJ  -------------  approves of the retention of any such station by
the Corporation or its  Affiliates after the expiration of the ninety (90)
day period following the  Closing of the Merger, but before December 31,
2000, the Agreed Value of  each such station shall be 19.23 times broadcast
cashflow relating to such  station or stations computed with respect to the
twelve (12) month period  ending at the end of the month immediately
preceding sale of any such  station or station, as the case may be, but in no
event more than the price  that would have been paid for such station as set
forth on Exhibit "B-1"  -------------  hereto. If the DOJ shall fail to
approve before December 31, 2000 the  retention of any station by the
Corporation or its Affiliates (or if at any  time before December 31, 2000
the ZSPN Representatives shall determine to  discontinue to seek the DOJ\'s
approval for the retention of any such  station(s) by the Corporation or its
Affiliates, including without  limitation because the ZSPN Representatives
believe that it may be  impractical to obtain such DOJ approval or for any
other reason), then any  station(s) with respect to which there shall have
been such a failure to  obtain DOJ approval or such a determination to
discontinue to seek DOJ  approval, shall not be transferred to the
Corporation or its Affiliates,  shall cease to be covered by this subsection
(iii), and shall instead to be  sold to third part(ies) as contemplated by
subsection (ii) above.   (iv) For purposes of computing the Net Cash
Proceeds of the  sale of any of the FCC Excluded Stations or DOJ Excluded
Stations under the  foregoing subsection (i), costs incurred in connection
with the sale shall  include Taxes (the "Disposition Tax Cost") incurred on
any income or gain  recognized by the Corporation or any of its Affiliates in
connection with  the sale of such station; provided that such taxes shall not
be treated as  incurred in an amount which exceeds that amount of Taxes (the
"ZSPN Tax  Amount") that would have been payable by ZSPN and its Affiliates
with  respect to such income, determined as if such corporations continued
to  file their returns on the same basis as such returns were filed for the 
periods ending on the Closing Date, including taking into account as  offsets
against such income or gain any federal and state losses or loss 
carryforwards of ZSPN and its Affiliates that existed at the time of the 
Merger and would have been usable in the first taxable year of any of such 
corporations beginning after the Closing, and without regard to any income 
of such corporations arising after the Closing Date other than income and 
gain attributable to the sale of the FCC Excluded Stations and DOJ Excluded 
Stations.   -4-    (v) All amounts of Contingent Cash Consideration
payable  pursuant to this Section 2.7(b) shall be treated as Cash
Consideration  Value for purposes of Section 2.9(a) and shall be paid by wire
transfer of  immediately available funds, as directed by the ZSPN
Representatives  pursuant to Section 2.9(b). Payments required by Section
2.7(b)(i) or (ii)  shall be made by Entravision within two (2) business days
after receipt of  the proceeds of a sale of any station requiring such
payments (treating for  purposes of this initial payment the ZSPN Tax Amount
(or a good faith  estimate thereof) as if it were equal to the Disposition
Tax Cost), and  payments required by Section 2.7(b)(iii) shall be made within
two (2)  business days after the approval of the retention or transfer
referred to  therein. Promptly after sufficient facts become available to
make a final  determination of the ZSPN Tax Amount or the actual Disposition
Tax Cost  with respect to any station sale, but not later than date of the
filing of  the income tax returns reflecting the gain recognized on the sale
of any  such station, the excess, if any, of the Contingent Cash
Consideration over  the amount previously paid under Section 2.9(b) shall be
paid by wire  transfer of immediately available funds, as directed by the
ZSPN  Representatives pursuant to Section 2.9(b). In the event the ZSPN Tax 
Amount or the Disposition Tax Cost is subsequently determined to be 
different than the amounts previously reflected in the determination of the 
amount of the Contingent Cash Consideration paid pursuant to this Section 
2.7(b), the Contingent Cash Consideration payable hereunder shall be 
recumputed. Any additional Contingent Cash Consideration payable (or any 
excess of prior payments over the corrected Contingent Cash Consideration) 
shall be paid promptly to (or by) the ZSPN Representatives, as may be 
necessary to cause the total Contingent Cash Consideration paid hereunder  to
be correct.   6. Section 2.14 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to
read in full as follows:   "2.14. FCC Licenses, Permits and Authorizations.
The parties hereto  ----------------------------------------  acknowledge
and agree that, in connection with the FCC Consent, with the  exception of
the license for KLNZ-FM which shall remain in KLNZ License  Co., LLC,
Entravision may cause ZSPN and its Affiliates to assign all of  its right,
title and interest in and to all FCC licenses, permits and  authorizations
(and the call letters with respect thereto) held by ZSPN and  the ZSPN
Subsidiaries to Holdings, and that the FCC consent will reflect  Holdings as
the assignee of the FCC licenses held by ZSPN and the ZSPN 
Subsidiaries."   7. A new Section 2.15 shall be added to the Original
Agreement to read in full as follows:   -5-    "2.15. Escrow Amount. At
the Closing, Entravision shall pay the  -------------  Escrow Amount to the
ZSPN Representatives by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to such
account as may be designated by the ZSPN  Representatives. Expenditure of the
Escrow Amount shall be in the sole  discretion of the ZSPN Representatives,
and any amounts of the Escrow  Amount not expended by the ZSPN
Representatives shall be paid to the ZSPN  Stockholders as if it were
additional Cash Consideration Value payable at  the time of the Closing of
the Merger."   8. Section 3.1 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to
read in full as follows:   3.1. "Closing. The closing of the Merger
provided for in this  --------  Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at
the offices of Proskauer Rose  LLP in New York, New York at 10:00 a.m.
(Eastern Time) within two (2)  business days after which each of the
following has occurred (or is  occurring concurrently): (i) the Corporation
shall have received the  proceeds from the IPO, (ii) the Roll-Up has closed,
(iii) the FCC Consent  becomes a Final Order and (iv) the applicable waiting
period under the HSR  Act has expired or been terminated, or such date as
Entravision and ZSPN  may mutually agree, or at such other time and place as
Entravision and ZSPN  may mutually agree, and Entravision, Acquisition Co.
and ZSPN agree to  cooperate and use their Best Efforts to close the
Contemplated Transactions  as soon as practicable after the FCC Consent
becomes a Final Order;  provided, however, that Entravision and ZSPN, by
mutual agreement, may  waive the condition to the Closing that the FCC
Consent be a Final Order  and, in such case, the Closing shall occur at such
time and place as the  parties may mutually agree after grant of FCC Consent
and upon the  occurrence of all other required conditions to the Closing.
Subject to the  provisions of Article 11 below, failure to consummate the
Merger on the  date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this
section will not  result in the termination of this Agreement and will not
relieve any party  of any obligation under this Agreement."   9. Section
3.4(n) of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to delete the reference to
Arthur Rockwell.   10. Section 3.4(l) of the Original Agreement is amended
and restated to read as follows:   "(l) the written legal opinions of
Proskauer Rose LLP, corporate  counsel for ZSPN and the Stockholders, and
Shaw Pittman, FCC counsel for  ZSPN and the Stockholders, substantially in

11. Section 3.5(a) of the Original Agreement is amended and restated to read
as follows:   "(a) The ZSPN Fixed Equity Consideration; provided, however,
that the  Corporation will deliver to its transfer agent a letter of
transmittal and  instruction irrevocably instructing that stock certificates

designated by the  ZSPN Representatives as soon as possible after the Closing
and the  Corporation will continue to use reasonable and diligent efforts to
cause  its transfer agent to promptly issue such stock certificates."   12.
Section 5.4 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended to read in full as
follows:   "5.4 Capitalization.  --------------   (a) The authorized

A Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per  share, none of which are issued and

(b) Schedule 5.4(b)-1 to this First Amendment sets forth the pro 
-----------------  forma fully-diluted capitalization of the Corporation as

adjustment of the  Exchange Number (as defined in the Exchange Agreement).
The "Entravision  Fully-Diluted Shares" as defined in this Agreement shall be
as of the  Closing as set forth on Schedule 5.4(b)-1 to this First
Amendment.  -----------------   -7-    (c) The outstanding units of
membership interest in the Company  (the "Units") consist of an aggregate of
1,953,924 Units, 1,555,037 of  which are designated Class A Units, none of
which are designated Class B  Units, 286,206 of which are designated Class C
Units, 102,368 of which are  designated Class D Units and 10,313 of which are

this Agreement, will be duly and  validly issued, fully-paid and
nonassessable, and will be free of  restrictions on transfer other than
restrictions on transfer under this  Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement
and applicable federal and state  securities laws and will not have been
issued in violation of any  preemptive rights."   13. Section 9.3(b) of the
Original Agreement shall be amended to read in full as follows:   "(b) From
and after the Effective Time, each outstanding ZSPN  Option shall be assumed
by Entravision and shall be deemed to constitute a  substitute option under
the Entravision Communications Corporation 2000  Omnibus Equity Incentive
Plan to acquire, on the same terms and conditions  as were applicable under
such ZSPN Option (including credit for vesting  periods elapsed under the
ZSPN 1999 Stock Incentive Plan), a number of  shares of Entravision Class A
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest  whole number) equal to the product
of (i) the number of ZSPN shares  pursuant to such ZSPN Option and (ii) ZSPN
Share Consideration divided by  (iii) the Entravision Share Consideration.
The exercise price per share of  Entravision Class A Common Stock (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent)  pursuant to such newly issued Entravision option
shall be calculated as the  quotient of (a) the exercise price per share of
ZSPN Common Stock pursuant  to such ZSPN Option and (b) the quotient of ZSPN
Share Consideration and  the Entravision Share Consideration. An illustration
of the above  calculation is attached hereto as Annex II. Consistent with the
respective  --------  option agreements entered into by the participants
under the   -8-    ZSPN 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Optionees"), the
Optionees shall agree  not to offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any
option or contract  to purchase, grant any option, right or warrant purchase,
or otherwise  transfer or dispose of directly or indirectly any Class A
Common Stock  received by the Optionees upon exercise of any substitute
option under the  Entravision Communications Corporation 2000 Omnibus Equity
Incentive Plan  for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date
of the final  prospectus relating to the Corporation\'s IPO.   In
connection with the ZSPN Options, ZSPN represents and warrants that  there
are currently 1,997,861 ZSPN Options, none of which have been  exercised as
of the date hereof. Therefore, in the event that the ZSPN  Options exceed
1,997,861 (the "ZSPN Non-Disclosed Options"), the  Corporation will be
entitled to a credit on the ZSPN Fixed Equity  Consideration, which will be
payable from the Escrow Amount, in the amount  equal to the net equity value
of such ZSPN Non-Disclosed Options calculated  in the same manner as the
Option Rollover Amount."   14. Section 12.1 shall be amended to read in full
as follows:   "12.1. Authorization of the ZSPN Representatives. Upon
adoption of  -----------------------------------------  this Agreement by
the Board of Directors of ZSPN and approval of this  Agreement by the Major
Stockholders pursuant to the Certificate of  Incorporation and Bylaws of ZSPN

action that  the ZSPN Representatives, in their sole and absolute discretion,
may  consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to

this Section 12.1: (i) is coupled with an interest and is being granted, in
part, as an inducement to Entravision and Acquisition Co. to enter into this
Agreement, and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Major Stockholder and shall be binding on
any successor thereto; and (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 12.3

as an ZSPN Representative of each of the Major Stockholders.   15. Annex I
and Annex II to the Original Agreement are hereby amended to  -------
-------- read in full as Annex I-1 and Annex II-1 attached to this First
Amendment.  --------- ----------   16. Except as expressly amended hereby,
all other terms and conditions of the Original Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.   17. This First Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which when fully-executed and delivered by all parties
hereto and taken together shall constitute a single agreement, binding
against each of the parties. To the maximum extent permitted by law or by any
applicable governmental authority, any document may be signed and transmitted
by facsimile with the same validity as if it were an ink-signed document.
Each signatory below represents and warrants by his or her signature that he
or she is duly authorized (on behalf of the respective entity for which such
