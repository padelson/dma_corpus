-vi-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of May 26, 2011 by and among Skyworks Solutions, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), PowerCo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the " _Merger Sub_ "),
and Advanced Analogic Technologies Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company
deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations
and the stockholders of their respective corporations that Merger Sub be
merged with and into the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), with the Company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer
(the " _Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to the BuyerÂ’s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, (a) the stockholders of the Company named on _Schedule A_ hereto
have entered into the Stockholder Agreement, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Stockholder
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things,
agreed to vote all voting securities of the Company that such stockholders own
or control (or over which they exercise voting control) for the approval of
the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement; and (b) the stockholder of the
Company listed on _Schedule 7.2(f)_ has entered into a Non-competition, Non-
solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement (the " _Noncompetition Agreement_
"), pursuant to which he has agreed, among other things, not to compete with
the Buyer or the Company for a specified period of time following the
Effective Time (the effectiveness of which Noncompetition Agreement is
subject, as a condition subsequent, to the occurrence of the Effective Time);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall prepare, and on the Closing
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter the Buyer shall cause to be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and
executed by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as is established by the Buyer and the Company and set
forth in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). _EXECUTION COPY_



 

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the
Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing
and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 950 Page Mill Road, Palo
Alto, California, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing
by the Buyer and the Company.

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (i) the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the Company following the Merger is sometimes referred to
herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and (ii) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended in its entirety so that such Certificate of
Incorporation is identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) all
references to the name of Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the
name of the Company and (B) the identity of the incorporator shall be deleted
and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in
accordance with the DGCL. In addition, the Buyer shall cause the By-laws of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time to be amended
and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective
Time, they are identical to the By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the
name of Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the
Company, and, as so amended and restated, such By-laws shall be the By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section  259 of the DGCL.

1.4 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



-2-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned
by the Buyer, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Exchange Ratio for Company Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.2_, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Company Shares under _Section 2.4_) issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company
Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_, a cash payment in the
amount of $3.68 (as the same may be adjusted in accordance herewith, the "
_Cash Amount_ ") plus 0.08725 of a share of Buyer Common Stock (the " _Stock
Amount_ ") (the Cash Amount and the Stock Amount are together referred to as
the " _Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the product
of the Stock Amount and the average last reported sale price of Buyer Common
Stock (at the 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, end of regular trading hours) on the
five (5) full trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the
date on which the Effective Time occurs (such average, the " _Average Price_
," and such product, the " _Closing Value_ ") is less than $2.45, then the
Cash Amount shall be increased by the difference between the $2.45 and the
Closing Value and if the Closing Value is more than $2.45, then the Cash
Amount shall be reduced by the difference between the Closing Value and $2.45
(but in no event shall the Cash Amount as reduced be less than zero); but
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Average Price is less than $21.00, then
Buyer shall have the right to pay the entire Merger Consideration in cash, and
in such case the Cash Amount will be $6.13 and the Stock Amount will be zero.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Buyer Common Stock_ " means common stock,
$0.25 par value per share, of the Buyer. As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with _Section 2.2_, without interest, subject to the provisions of _Section
2.4_.

(d)  _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Buyer
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(e) _Unvested Stock_. At the Effective Time, any shares of Buyer Common Stock
issued in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ with respect to any unvested
shares of Company Common Stock awarded to employees, directors or consultants
pursuant to any of the CompanyÂ’s plans or arrangements and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall

 



-3-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and vesting schedule as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent by their
terms such unvested shares of Company Common Stock vest at the Effective
Time. The Company shall not take or permit any action which would accelerate
vesting of any unvested shares, except to the extent required by the terms of
an agreement or plan "made available" to the Buyer (as defined in _Section
9.8_) that is applicable to such shares in effect on the date hereof. Copies
of the relevant agreements governing such shares and the vesting thereof have
been provided to the Buyer. All outstanding rights which the Company may hold
immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of
Company Common Stock shall be assigned to the Buyer in the Merger and shall
thereafter be exercisable by the Buyer upon the same terms and conditions in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the shares
purchasable pursuant to such rights and the purchase price payable per share
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the Option Exchange Ratio. The
Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 2.1(e)_ to occur.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Company Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for Buyer Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with
the BuyerÂ’s transfer agent or another bank or trust company designated by the
Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_, through the Exchange Agent, (i) the
aggregate amount of cash and certificates representing the aggregate number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock (such cash and shares of Buyer Common Stock
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") issuable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
(ii) cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments for fractional shares
required pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, and (iii) any dividends or
distributions to which holders of certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Company Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section
2.1_ into the right to receive shares of Buyer Common Stock may then be
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_. 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Company Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form with such provisions as the
Buyer and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the
applicable cash amount and certificates representing the applicable number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
of Buyer Common Stock and any dividends or distributions as provided below).
Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Buyer,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
cash amount which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ and 

 



-4-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II,_ plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_ and any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable
cash amount and a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_ and any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_, may be issued or paid to a person other than the person in
whose name the Company Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Company Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Company Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable cash amount and a certificate or
certificates representing the applicable number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock that the holder of such Company Certificate has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_ and any dividends or
distributions then payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d),_ as contemplated by
this _Section 2.2_, subject to the provisions of _Section 2.4_.

 

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Company Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the
Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common
Stock (after taking into account all Company Certificates delivered by such
holder and the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by
the average of the last reported sales prices of Buyer Common Stock at the
4:00 p.m., Eastern time, end of regular trading hours on Nasdaq during the ten
(10) consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate until the holder of record of
such Company Certificate shall surrender such Company Certificate. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Company
Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the record holder of the
Company Certificate, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously
paid with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, without
interest, and, at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions having a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender that are payable with
respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock.

 



-5-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of
Buyer Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or
dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to _Sections 2.2(c)_ or
_2.2(d)_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one hundred
eighty (180) after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon
demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously
complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only to the Buyer, as
a general unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim for Buyer Common Stock,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and any dividends
or distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock.

(g) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Buyer
Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Company Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one (1) year
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any shares of Buyer Common Stock, and any cash payable to the holder of such
Company Certificate or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of
such Company Certificate pursuant to this  _Article II_ would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares
of Buyer Common Stock or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Company Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Internal Revenue Code_ ") or any
other applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the
Buyer, as the case may be.

 

(i) _Lost Company Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving

 



-6-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificate the shares of Buyer Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Buyer
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, and all
stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ") themselves, insofar as they relate to outstanding
Company Options, shall be assumed by the Buyer and each Company Option shall
become an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the quotient obtained from
dividing $6.13 by the Average Price (the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ ")
(rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a price per share of Buyer
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient
obtained from dividing (x) the exercise price per share for the shares of
Company Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the assumed Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio. Such
Company Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions to
which they are subject (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section
2._3 after giving effect to the Merger).

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deliver
to the participants in the Company Stock Plans an appropriate notice setting
forth such participantsÂ’ rights pursuant to the Company Options, as provided
in this  _Section 2.3_.

(c) The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Company Options assumed in accordance with this _Section
2.3_. As soon as practicable (but in no event more than ten (10) business days
after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to
the shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such options, and thereafter shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of that
registration statement for as long as any such Company Options remain
outstanding.

(d) The Company shall (i) terminate its 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the " _ESPP_ ") in accordance with its terms as of or prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) provide notice as required in Section 19(c) of the ESPP, and (iii)
not commence any new offering period under the ESPP after the date of this
Agreement.

(e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding award of Company restricted stock
units (" _Company Restricted Stock Units_ ") that is to be settled in Company
Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be assumed by the Buyer (each,

 



-7-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 an " _Assumed Restricted Stock Unit_ "). In accordance with its terms, each
Assumed Restricted Stock Unit shall be converted into a restricted stock unit
to acquire that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit, and (y) the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Buyer Common Stock. Each
Assumed Restricted Stock Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including as to vesting) as were applicable under the respective
Company Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time.

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has neither voted in
favor of the Merger Agreement or the Merger nor consented thereto in writing
and who has properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ "
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holderÂ’s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 2.1_, but shall be entitled only to such rights
as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.1_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Certificate formerly representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice,
filings, correspondence or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment or make or accept any settlement offer prior to
the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument
unless the Buyer shall have given its prior express written consent to such
payment or settlement offer (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld).

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_
" means any effect, circumstance, change, event and/or development (each an "
_Effect_ ", and collectively, " _Effects_ ") that, either individually or in

material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or results of operations of the Company

caused by any of the matters described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (g) or (h)
or resulting directly and primarily from any of the matters described in
clauses (d), (e) or (f) below shall be deemed to be or to constitute a

caused by any of the matters described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (g) or (h) or

(d), (e), or (f) below shall be taken into account when determining whether a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or may occur:

(a) general economic conditions in the United States, China or any other
country (or changes therein), general conditions in the financial markets in
the United States, China or any other country (or changes therein), or
general political conditions in the United States, China or any other country
(or changes therein), in any such case to the extent that such conditions or
changes do not affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in a disproportionate
manner relative to other participants in the industries in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries conduct business;

(b) general conditions in the industries in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries conduct business (or changes therein) to the extent that such

to the extent that such acts of terrorism, war or armed hostilities do not
affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries directly or in a
disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the industries in

(d) the response of customers, suppliers, distributors, business partners and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the announcement of this

-9-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(e) action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the express written
request of the Buyer after the date hereof (and in conformity therewith) that
is not required by the terms of this Agreement;

(f) changes in GAAP (or the interpretation thereof) that affect the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(g) changes (in and of themselves) in the trading price or volume of the
CompanyÂ’s stock (it being understood, acknowledged and agreed that the
underlying causes of, and the facts, circumstances or occurrences giving rise
or contributing to such changes may be deemed to constitute a "Company
Material Adverse Effect" (unless otherwise excluded by this definition) and
may be taken into account in determining whether there has been, is, or would
be a Company Material Adverse Effect); or

(h) failure (in and of itself) by the Company to meet any internal or public
projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings (it being
understood, acknowledged and agreed that the underlying causes of, and the
facts, circumstances or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
failure, and any legal liabilities resulting from such failure, may be deemed
to constitute a "Company Material Adverse Effect" (unless otherwise excluded
by this definition) and may be taken into account in determining whether there
has been, is, or would, could or is likely to be a Company Material Adverse
Effect).

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that for all purposes of
this Agreement: (i) with respect to the assets and/or liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, an Effect that would otherwise constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect (or would otherwise be considered in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would,
could or is likely to occur) shall constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect (and shall be considered in determining whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or would, could or is likely to occur) even if
such Effect is a one-time or non-recurring and whether or not the impact of
such Effect is permanent, ongoing, long-term or short-term; (ii) the term
"business" includes (but is not limited to) the long-term future earnings
potential of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iii) the terms "material",
"materially" or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower
case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without
regard to the meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse Effect in this
forepart to _Article III_ or to Buyer Material Adverse Effect in _Article
IV_; (iv) when a statement in a representation and warranty in _Article III_
is qualified by the phrase "in all material respects," materiality shall be
determined solely by reference to, and solely within the context of, the
particular representation and warranty in which such qualifying phrase is
used and not with respect to the entirety of this Agreement or the entirety of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (v) to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, (A) the representations and warranties,
covenants, agreements and closing conditions in this Agreement shall be
construed to be cumulative, (B) each representation and warranty, covenant,
agreement and closing condition in this Agreement shall be given full separate
and independent effect, and (C) no limitation in or exception to any
representation and warranty, covenant, agreement or closing condition shall
be construed to limit

 or apply to any other representation and warranty, covenant, agreement or
closing condition unless such limitation or exception is expressly made
applicable to such other representation and warranty, covenant, agreement or
closing condition.

Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2010 and

paragraphs and clauses corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections,
subsections, paragraphs and clauses contained in this _Article IV_  and the
disclosure in any section, subsection, paragraph or clause shall qualify (1)
the corresponding section, subsection, paragraph or clause in this _Article
IV_ and (2) the other sections, subsections, paragraphs and clauses in this
_Article IV_ only to the extent that it is reasonably clear from a reading of
such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections,
subsections, paragraphs and clauses.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Buyer Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any effect, circumstance, change, event and/or development (each an "
_Effect_ ", and collectively, " _Effects_ ") that, either individually or in
the aggregate, and taken together with all other Effects, has (or have) a
material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or results of operations of the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, taking the Buyer together with its Subsidiaries as a whole;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Effect (either by itself or when aggregated
or taken together with any and all other such Effects) proximately caused by
any of the matters described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (g) or (h) or resulting
directly and primarily from any of the matters described in clauses (d), (e)
or (f) below shall be deemed to be or to constitute a "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect," and no Effect (either by itself or when aggregated or taken together
with any and all other such Effects) proximately caused by any of the matters
described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (g) or (h) or resulting directly and
primarily from any of the matters described in clauses (d), (e), or (f) below
shall be taken into account when determining whether a "Buyer Material
Adverse Effect" has occurred or may occur:

(a) general economic conditions in the United States or any other country (or
changes therein), general conditions in the financial markets in the United
States or any other country (or changes therein), or general political
conditions in the United States or any other country (or changes therein),
in any such case to the extent that such conditions or changes do not affect
the Buyer and its Subsidiaries in a disproportionate manner relative to other
participants in the industries in which the Buyer and its Subsidiaries conduct
business; 

(b) general conditions in the industries in which the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries conduct business (or changes therein) to the extent that such
conditions or changes do not affect the Buyer and its Subsidiaries in a
disproportionate manner relative to other participants in the industries in
which the Buyer and its Subsidiaries conduct business;

 



-35-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(c) general conditions caused by acts of terrorism, war or armed hostilities
to the extent that such acts of terrorism, war or armed hostilities do not
affect the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries directly or in a disproportionate
manner relative to other participants in the industries in which the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries conduct business;

(d) the response of customers, suppliers, distributors, business partners and
employees of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries to the announcement of this
Agreement and the pendency of the transactions contemplated hereby;

(e) action taken by the Buyer or its Subsidiaries at the express written
request of the Company after the date hereof (and in conformity therewith)
that is not required by the terms of this Agreement;

 

(f) changes in GAAP (or the interpretation thereof) that affect the
consolidated financial statements of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries; 

(g) changes (in and of themselves) in the trading price or volume of the
BuyerÂ’s stock (it being understood, acknowledged and agreed that the
underlying causes of, and the facts, circumstances or occurrences giving rise
or contributing to such changes may be deemed to constitute a "Buyer Material
Adverse Effect" (unless otherwise excluded by this definition) and may be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, is, or would be a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect); or

(h) failure (in and of itself) by the Buyer to meet any internal or public
projections, forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings (it being
understood, acknowledged and agreed that the underlying causes of, and the
facts, circumstances or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
failure, and any legal liabilities resulting from such failure, may be deemed
to constitute a "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" (unless otherwise excluded by
this definition) and may be taken into account in determining whether there
has been, is, or would, could or is likely to be a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect).

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that for all purposes of this
Agreement: (i) with respect to the assets and/or liabilities of the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, an Effect that would otherwise constitute a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect (or would otherwise be considered in determining whether a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would, could or is likely to
occur) shall constitute a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (and shall be
considered in determining whether a Buyer Material Adverse Effect has occurred
or would, could or is likely to occur) even if such Effect is a one-time or
non-recurring and whether or not the impact of such Effect is permanent,
ongoing, long-term or short-term; (ii) the term "business" includes (but is
not limited to) the long-term future earnings potential of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries; (iii) the terms "material", "materially" or "materiality" as
used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall have their
respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meanings
ascribed to Buyer Material Adverse Effect in this forepart to  _Article IV_
or to Company Material Adverse Effect in _Article III_; (iv) when a statement
in a representation and warranty in _Article IV_ is qualified by the phrase
"in all material respects," materiality shall be determined solely by
reference to, and solely within the context of, the particular representation
and warranty

 



-36-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 in which such qualifying phrase is used and not with respect to the entirety
of this Agreement or the entirety of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (v) to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually
exclusive and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (A) the
representations and warranties, covenants, agreements and closing conditions
in this Agreement shall be construed to be cumulative, (B) each
representation and warranty, covenant, agreement and closing condition in this
Agreement shall be given full separate and independent effect, and (C) no
limitation in or exception to any representation and warranty, covenant,
agreement or closing condition shall be construed to limit or apply to any
other representation and warranty, covenant, agreement or closing condition
unless such limitation or exception is expressly made applicable to such
other representation and warranty, covenant, agreement or closing condition.

properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes

not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.

-44-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 the Company Board, as determined in good faith by the Company Board after
consultation with outside counsel, in response to a proposal that constitutes
(or that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its independent financial adviser, is reasonable
likely to lead to) a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by
the Company of this _Section 6.1_, and subject to compliance with _Section
6.1(c)_, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the person
making the proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party than the

-45-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 action within the scope of clauses (x), (y) and/or (z), a " _Change in
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the
contrary provided herein, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Change in Recommendation
if the Company Board has received an Acquisition Proposal that it determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties,
_provided_ that (and only if) (A) the Company has not violated, in any
material respect, any of the terms of _Section 6.1(a)_, _Section 6.1(b)_ or
this _Section 6.1(c)_ in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, (B) the
Company shall have given the Buyer at least three (3) business daysÂ’ prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
include the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and, no later
than the time of such notice, provided the Buyer a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreement and other material documents with the party
making such Superior Proposal, (C) if requested by the Buyer, the Company
shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent during such three (3)
business day notice period to enable the Buyer to propose changes to the
terms of this Agreement that would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (D) the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) any changes to this Agreement proposed by the Buyer in a written
offer capable of acceptance and determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given
effect, and (E) in the event of any material change to the financial or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case,

business day notice period shall have recommenced. Subject to the provisions
of _Section 8.1(h)_, nothing in this  _Section 6.1_ shall be deemed to (A)
permit the Company to take any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of
the first sentence of _Section 6.1(b)_, or (B) affect any obligation of the
Company under this Agreement or (C) limit the CompanyÂ’s obligation to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting, regardless of whether
the Company Board has made a Change in Recommendation.

required by the immediately preceding sentence shall be given verbally (if
possible and if written notification has not already been given) and in

the Buyer fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and details
(including any change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or

Proposal or inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of such information to
the Buyer.

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.1_

Board or any committee thereof withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger.

its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately all

years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the CompanyÂ’s obligations to

-52-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(c) The provisions of _Section 6.11(b)_ may be satisfied by either the
Buyer or the Company purchasing a "tail" policy under the CompanyÂ’s
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy in effect immediately
before the Effective Time which (i) has an effective term of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are covered by
the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy in effect
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms and
conditions (including coverage amounts) which are no less advantageous than
those contained in the terms and conditions of the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance policy in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Buyer will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume such policy, and the Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain in effect such "tail" policy for the duration of its term
without amendment or cancellation.

warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of

satisfied by the Buyer and Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, as the case may be, or by any officer, director, employee or
agent thereof, under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ will not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or
the conditions to such partyÂ’s obligation to consummate the Merger, and the
non-delivery of such notice shall not be deemed to be a failure to satisfy a
closing condition unless the underlying facts had caused such condition not to
be satisfied.

 6.13 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_.

(a) The Board of Directors of the Buyer, or a committee thereof consisting of
non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)

property interest as defined in Section 897(c) of the Internal Revenue Code,
together with a notice to the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with
the Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Internal Revenue

and arrangements have heretofore been disclosed and made available to the
Buyer; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating, or shall prohibit the Buyer from
causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate, any such Company
Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or
if otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time until the end of the BuyerÂ’s
current fiscal year or the end of the applicable current plan year, as the
Buyer shall prescribe in its sole discretion, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) either (i) maintain,
for the benefit of each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time who continues to be employed by the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries during such prescribed period (each such employee,
a " _Continuing Employee_ "), the Company Employee Plans (or substitute
plans), at benefit levels that, taken as a whole, are not materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the Continuing Employees than those in effect
at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement (excluding
equity-based compensation and benefits, compensation and benefits under
individual employment, severance and/or change-of-control agreements and
arrangements, special bonuses, and similar compensation and benefits),
or (ii) provide compensation and benefits (other than equity-based
compensation and benefits, compensation and benefits under individual
employment, severance and/or change-of-control agreements and arrangements,
special bonuses, and similar compensation and benefits) to each Continuing
Employee that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable in the

 based compensation and benefits, compensation and benefits under individual
employment, severance and/or change-of-control agreements and arrangements,
special bonuses and similar compensation and benefits) provided to comparably
ranked, similarly situated employees of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries

Agreement shall create for any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries any entitlement to continue employment with the Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

 

(c) The Buyer shall take (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take)
commercially reasonable action to provide the Continuing Employees with
credit for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
vesting, eligibility, participation and level of benefits (but not benefit
accruals) under all applicable Employee Benefit Plans and arrangements of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees participate after
the Effective Time in the same manner as if such service had been service for
the Buyer and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such credit
shall be required to the extent that such credit is not permitted by the
terms of the applicable plan or would impose any out-of-pocket cost on the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (other than de minimis administrative fees)
or would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law and plans, the
Buyer shall take (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take) such
actions as are necessary to cause the group health plan maintained by the
Buyer or the applicable Subsidiary of the Buyer, and applicable insurance
carriers, third-party administrators and any other third parties, to the
extent such group health plan is made available to Continuing Employees, to
waive any evidence of insurability requirements, waiting periods, and any
limitations as to preexisting medical conditions under the group health plan
applicable to Continuing Employees and their spouses and eligible dependents
(but only to the extent that such evidence of insurability requirement,
waiting periods and preexisting condition limitations did not apply or were
satisfied under the group health plan maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and only to the extent that such
waiver can be obtained under such plan without out-of-pocket cost to the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(other than de minimis administrative and legal fees);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be credited for purposes of accrual of
pension benefits or to the extent that it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits.

administering the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ "), shall adopt

collect payment, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee at
the publicly announced prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. plus five percent

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub, _provided_ ,

by law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of

hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is
specified in the extension or waiver. The non-assertion by any party to this
Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telecopy, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such
notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless
and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any
party to this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms, except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.2_.

9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 6.11_,
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.

 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Buyer and/or Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer without consent of the Company,
_provided_ that the Buyer and/or Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall remain
liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 9.6 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted 

 



-64-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term
or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular article, section, subsection,
paragraph, clause or other subdivision. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference
to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation". No summary of this Agreement prepared by
any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
phrase "made available," when it refers to documents or information being
made available to the Buyer and its representatives, means that the indicated
documents or information have been uploaded to the data site on or before May
23, 2011 and were in fact available through the data site to the Buyer and
its Representatives.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.11 _Enforcement; Arbitration_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) The parties hereto agree that any and all disputes arising under or
related in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be resolved
solely in arbitration before the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(the " _Delaware Court of Chancery_ ") as set forth below. Accordingly, and
for the sake of clarity, the parties hereto agree that they are waiving and
relinquishing the right to bring any dispute arising under or related in any
way to this Agreement or the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement before a court of any state or the United States; that they are
waiving any right to have such dispute decided by a jury; and that they are
also waiving any right to argue that the forum for the arbitration is an
inconvenient one. The parties intend that this _Section 9.11_ be interpreted
as broadly as possible, and in favor of prompt and binding arbitration.

 

(c) The parties hereto agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Dispute_ ") shall be
arbitrated in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to 10 Del. C. Â§ 349 and
the Rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery promulgated thereunder (the "
_Chancery Rules_ "). The parties hereto agree to take all steps necessary or
advisable, including execution of documents to be filed with the Delaware
Court of Chancery, in order properly to submit such Dispute for Arbitration
(as defined in the Chancery Rules) in accordance with this _Section 9.11_,
and each such party agrees that it shall raise no objection to the submission
of such Dispute to Arbitration in accordance with this _Section 9.11_
and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may have or hereafter have to the submission of such Dispute
for Arbitration or any right to lay claim to jurisdiction in any venue.

 

(d) The Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Chancery Rules;
_provided_ that the parties hereto may agree to amend, modify or alter such
rules, and/or adopt new rules, in each case with the consent of the
Arbitrator. Any such amendments, modifications or alterations shall be in
writing and signed by an authorized representative of each such party. The
Arbitration shall take place in Delaware or such other location as the
parties and the Arbitrator may agree.

(e) The Arbitration shall be presided over by one arbitrator (the "
_Arbitrator_ ") who shall be a chancellor or vice-chancellor of the Delaware
Court of Chancery appointed as an arbitrator by the Delaware Court of
Chancery.

 



-66-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(f) Any issue concerning the extent to which any Dispute is subject to
Arbitration shall be decided by the Arbitrator.

(g) The arbitral award (the " _Award_ ") shall (i) be written or oral, (ii)
state the reasons for the award, and (iii) be the sole and exclusive binding
remedy with respect to the Dispute between and among the parties. The parties
hereto acknowledge that time is of the essence and the parties hereto
agree that they shall not seek to vary the timing provisions of the Chancery
Rules. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. All Awards of the Arbitrator shall be final, nonappealable and
binding on the parties. The parties hereto waive any right to refer any
question of law and right of appeal on the law and/or merits to any court,
including any appeal contemplated by 10 Del. C. Â§ 349(b). The Award shall be
deemed an award of the United States, the relationship between the parties
shall be deemed commercial in nature, and any Dispute arbitrated pursuant to
this _Section 9.11_ shall be deemed commercial.

(h) The Arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable or legal
remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding intended to
resolve a Dispute, including entering injunctive or other equitable relief
pending the final decision of the Arbitrator or the rendering of the Award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that any petition for
arbitration submitted pursuant to this _Section 9.11_ shall seek specific
performance of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and may also seek monetary damages but only in the event that
a grant of an award of specific performance of the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not awarded.

(i) The parties hereto agree that the Arbitration, and all matters relating
thereto or arising thereunder, including the existence of the Dispute, the
proceeding and all of its elements (including any pleadings, briefs or other
documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral
submissions, and any decision of the Arbitrator or Award), shall be kept
strictly confidential, and each party hereto hereby agrees that such
information shall not be disclosed beyond (i) the Arbitrator or such other
persons as are contemplated by 10 Del. C. Â§ 349(b), (ii) such partyÂ’s legal
counsel, for any purpose related to the Dispute, (iii) the other party to the
Dispute, (iv) the other partyÂ’s legal counsel, for any purpose related to the
Dispute, (v) any person necessary to the conduct of the Arbitration, and (vi)
solely in connection with a partyÂ’s enforcement of an Award in a court having
jurisdiction thereof in accordance with _Section 9.13(l),_ such court;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that each party hereto agrees that, prior to
disclosing any information to any party listed in subclauses (ii), (iv) or (v)
above, such party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
recipient of such information to agree to maintain the confidentiality of
such agreement in a manner consistent with the terms hereof.

(j) Each party hereto shall bear its own legal fees and costs in connection
with the Arbitration; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such party shall pay
one-half of any filing fees, fees and expenses of the Arbitrator or other
similar costs incurred by the parties in connection with the prosecution of
the Arbitration.

(k) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Arbitrator may impose rules
different from, or in addition to, those set forth in this _Section 9.11_,
and nothing in this

 



-67-  _EXECUTION COPY_



 

  _Section 9.11_ shall be construed to limit or restrict the Arbitrator from
adopting any such rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitration to be
conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 9.11_, and hereby further waives the right to
object to the conduct of the Arbitration in accordance therewith.

(l) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section 9.11_, each party
hereto shall be entitled to seek interim or provisional relief in the
Delaware Court of Chancery or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, any Federal court located in the State of Delaware to (i)
protect the rights or property of such party, (ii) maintain the status quo
until such time as the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is
otherwise resolved, or (iii) prevent breaches of this Agreement. By doing so,
such party does not waive any right or remedy under this Agreement. Each
party hereto (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery or any Federal court located in the State of
Delaware in any proceeding seeking such relief, and (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court.

(m) Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the Arbitrator, the Delaware Court of Chancery and
the Federal courts located in the State of Delaware in connection with
proceedings pursuant to this _Section 9.11_, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, and (d)
agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in
any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party
with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the
address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
9.2_. Nothing in this _Section 9.11_, however, shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE BUYER, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
