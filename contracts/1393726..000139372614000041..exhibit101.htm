ARTICLE II.



EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK OF CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;



COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of Common Stock or any shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"):

(a) (i) each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
that is issued or outstanding and owned directly or indirectly by Parent,
Holdings or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Cancelled
Shares") shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor;

(ii) any shares of Common Stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and shall, at the election of Parent, either (A) convert into
shares of a class of stock of the Surviving Corporation designated by Parent
in connection with the Merger or (B) be cancelled;



(b) each share of Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
(1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation; and

(c) each share of Common Stock (including each share of Restricted Stock) that
is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Cancelled Shares and Appraisal Shares, shall automatically be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $10.00, without interest and
subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable Law (the "Merger
Consideration") and all such shares of Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "Common Stock Certificate") or
book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares") that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any shares of Common Stock shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except, in all
cases, the right to receive (other than with respect to the Cancelled Shares
and the Appraisal Shares) the Merger Consideration, without interest, to be
paid in consideration therefore upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.05.

Section 2.02 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares
of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.



Section 2.03 Restricted Stock; Company Stock Options.

(a) Restricted Stock. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take, and cause the Board or any committee administering the Stock Option
Plans to adopt resolutions approving the taking of, all actions to provide
that each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the
Stock Option Plans or any applicable restricted stock award agreement
(collectively, "Restricted Stock") (i) shall automatically vest and become
free of such restrictions (regardless of whether the documents governing such
Restricted Stock so provide) immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and (iii) shall be automatically converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(c);
provided, however, that the Merger Consideration shall be paid net of any
applicable tax withholdings as set forth in Section 2.03(b)(ii) below, which
the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly
pay when due to the appropriate Governmental Entity for the account of each
holder of the Restricted Stock.

(b) Stock Options.

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or
vested, that represents the right to acquire shares of Common Stock under the
Stock Option Plans or otherwise (such options, the "Cash Out Options"), the
Company shall take, and cause the Board or any committee administering the
Stock Option Plans to adopt resolutions approving the taking of, commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that each such Cash Out Option shall as of the
Effective Time (A) automatically become fully vested and exercisable
(regardless of whether the documents governing such Cash Out Options so
provide), (B) cease to be outstanding and be automatically cancelled and cease
to exist, and (C) be automatically converted into the right to receive the
Option Cash Amount. For purposes of this Section 2.03(b), "Option Cash Amount"
shall mean the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of the applicable Cash Out Option, and (2)
the number of shares subject to the applicable Cash Out Option; provided,
however, that the Option Cash Amount shall be paid net of any applicable tax
withholdings as set forth in clause (ii) below, which the Surviving
Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly pay when due to
the appropriate Governmental Entity for the account of each holder of the Cash
Out Option. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the exercise price per
share of the applicable Cash Out Option exceeds the Merger Consideration, such
Cash Out Options shall be cancelled and cease to exist without the payment of
any consideration.

(ii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay the aggregate Option Cash Amount
payable by the Surviving Corporation with respect to all Cash Out Options, to
the



account or accounts designated by the Company by wire transfer of immediately
available United States funds. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than the second business day thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the holders of Cash Out Options, as the case may be, the
cash payments specified in this Section 2.03(b). No interest shall be paid or
accrue on such cash payments. To the extent the Surviving Corporation or
Parent is required to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Cash Out Options or any
holder of Restricted Stock with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision
of any other tax Law, the amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Cash Out
Options or Restricted Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.04 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this
ARTICLE II to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, (a) the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number of
shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse 

stock split), split-up, combination or exchange or readjustment of shares, (b)
a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities of the Company
shall be declared with a record date within such period, or (c) any similar
event shall have occurred, then in each case the Merger Consideration and the
Option Cash Amount shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
shares of Common Stock and Cash Out Options, respectively, the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 2.05 Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares; Paying Agent.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate, and enter
into an agreement (which shall be in customary form reasonably acceptable to
the Company) with, a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as paying agent for the Merger Consideration payable to holders
of Common Stock as a result of the Merger upon surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable (the "Paying Agent"). Immediately prior to
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock that
have been converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), cash sufficient to effect the payment of the Merger
Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c)
upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. Such
Merger Consideration, once deposited with the Paying Agent, shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be held in trust for the benefit of such holders
and shall not be used for any other purposes.



(b) Payment Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but
no later than the second business day thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Common Stock
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in such a customary form reasonably acceptable to the
Company), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall be entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration,
without interest, in exchange for each share of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.05(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, (other than a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, representing shares of Common
Stock cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(a)) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the shares of
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, are convertible into pursuant to Section 2.01(c).

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock; Transfer Books. All
consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, and, at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, that evidenced ownership of either shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II, except as otherwise
provided by applicable Law. 

(d) Undistributed Merger Consideration. Any portion of the funds made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(a) that remains
undistributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Corporation or its designee, and any holder of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, who has not theretofore complied with
this



ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and only as a general
creditor thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE II upon surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. Any portion of the funds made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(a) that remains
unclaimed by holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, on
the date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective representatives shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting of a bond in customary
form in favor of the Surviving Corporation, in such reasonable amount as
Surviving Corporation may direct, as an unsecured indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the
shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this ARTICLE II.

(g) Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled, and shall be entitled to direct the Paying Agent, to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of any other state, local or foreign
tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, and shall be paid, by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.



ARTICLE III.

and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates (or, if
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the date of the filing of such
amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

other funds, reserves and expenses and cash flows included or incorporated by
reference therein (A) were prepared from the books and records of the
applicable Insurance Subsidiary, (B) fairly present in all material respects

Statutory Filings: (A) were determined in all material respects in accordance
with ASOPs in effect on that date (except as may be indicated in the notes

acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub that the Company and its
representatives are not making any representation or warranty in this
Agreement and nothing contained in this Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or any other agreement, document or instrument to be
delivered in connection with this Agreement is intended or shall be construed
to be a representation or warranty of the Company or any of its
representatives in respect of the adequacy or sufficiency of the reserves of
the Company or the Company's Insurance Subsidiaries.

(v) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise
and whether due or to become due) and there is no existing condition,
situation or set of circumstances that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in
accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except liabilities or obligations
(A) reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet, including
the notes thereto (the "Balance Sheet") of the Company as of December 31, 2013
(the "Balance Sheet Date") included in the Company SEC Documents, (B) incurred
after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent

(vi) The Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. The Company's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of internal control over
financial reporting as set forth in Rule 13a-15(f) are met. The Company has
evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting at the times and as required by the Exchange Act, and the
Company determined that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that the respective objectives of disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting were met as of the dates of such
evaluations. Since December 31, 2012, subject to any applicable grace periods,
(i) the Company and each of its officers and directors have been in compliance

against the counterparties, is enforceable against the Company and/or any

condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
cause such a violation of or default under) any Material Contract to which it

Company Permits, except for failures to comply that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2013, no event has occurred that (A)
gives to any third party any right of termination, cancellation, revocation or
adverse modification (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) of any

otherwise reasonably be expected to result in the



termination, cancellation, revocation, adverse modification or non-renewal of
any Material Company Permit, other than, in the case of clauses (A) and (B),

modification that has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

responsibility or obligation under, any Environmental Law, other than notices
the allegations of which have been resolved. To the Company's Knowledge, no
Hazardous Material has been released at, on, to, or under any real property
leased or operated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary during the term of

transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor any other Person,

Section 3.02 Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent
and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being
conducted. Holdings is a limited liability company duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
was formed and has all requisite limited liability company power and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent, Holdings and
Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Authority; Noncontravention.

(i) Each of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by the
Board of Directors or similar governing body of each of Parent, Holdings and
Merger Sub and no other corporate or limited liability company proceedings on
the part of Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby do not require approval of
the holders of any shares of capital stock of Parent. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by each of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Holdings and
Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent, Holdings and Merger
Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies. 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to the



loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any
of the properties or other assets of Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub under (A)
the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub
or the certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement of
Holdings, (B) any Contract to which Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub is a party
or any of their respective properties or other assets is subject, in any way
that would prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger (including the payments required to be made pursuant to ARTICLE II)
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (C) subject to the
governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence,
any (1) Law applicable to Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub or their respective
properties or other assets, or (2) order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment
or stipulation, in each case applicable to Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub or
their respective properties or other assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (B) and (C), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
rights, losses or Liens that would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) No material consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or
in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent,
Holdings and Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
for (A) the filing of a pre-merger notification and report form by Parent
under the HSR Act and the receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable,
of approvals or waiting periods required under the HSR Act or any other
applicable competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law or
regulation, (B) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, and (C) the Required Governmental
Authorizations and filings of the preacquisition statements required by
applicable state insurance holding company system laws indicated on Section
3.02(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and acquisition of control filing in
all jurisdictions indicated on Section 3.02(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule.

(c) Ownership and Interim Operations of Merger Sub. Parent owns, beneficially
and of record, all of the outstanding membership interests of Holdings.
Holdings owns, beneficially and of record, all of the outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub. Each of Holdings and Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, has engaged in no
other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated hereby.

(d) Financial Ability. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and
complete copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been
amended, supplemented or modified in any manner; (ii) the commitment contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter has not



been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect, (iii) there are no
agreements, side letters or arrangements, other than the Debt Commitment
Letter, to which Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub is a party relating to the
Debt Financing that could affect the availability of the Debt Financing, and
(iv) the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, including of the Debt
Financing Sources to provide the Financing contemplated thereby, subject only
to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exceptions or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting rights of creditors. The net proceeds of the commitment evidenced by
the Debt Commitment Letter (after netting 

out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums
and charges payable by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub) together with the
aggregate cash on hand of the Parent or available to the Parent pursuant to
existing credit facilities (both before and after giving effect to the
exercise of any or all "market flex" provisions related thereto) will be
sufficient for the satisfaction of Parent's, Holdings' and Merger Sub's
obligations to (i) pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii) pay any fees
and expenses of or payable by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub and/or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) pay all other amounts
required to be paid by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub on the Closing Date to
consummate the Transaction. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any
and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior
to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter.
Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI, as of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach or default under the Debt Commitment
Letter. As of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe
that, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI, any
Financing Conditions will not be satisfied as of the Closing Date or that the
financing under the Debt Commitment Letter will not be made available to
Parent on the Closing Date. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, is a party to any Contract, or has made or entered into
any formal or informal arrangement or other understanding (whether or not
binding), with any other Person that has or would have the effect of limiting
or prohibiting the right or ability of such Person to provide any other Person
with financing or other potential sources of capital (whether equity, debt,
rollover or a hybrid thereof) in connection with the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any alternatives thereto. In no
event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by or to Parent, Merger Sub or
any of its of their Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a
condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations hereunder.

(e) Ownership. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Holdings,
Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates, directly or indirectly,
beneficially own or control any shares of capital stock of the Company, and
none of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or their



respective Affiliates have any rights to acquire any shares of capital stock
other than pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) Legal Proceedings. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, legal or administrative proceeding, claim, suit, investigation or
action against Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree
imposed upon Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case, by or before any Governmental Entity, which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(g) Certain Arrangements. Except as set forth on Section 3.02(g) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, there are no Contracts between Parent, Holdings or Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's management or directors,
on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any way to the Company
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. During the past three (3)
years immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates has beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding
Common Stock.

(h) Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries except for RBC Capital
Markets, LLC, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Parent.

(i) Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. Parent, Holdings and
Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (i) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers or 

employees makes, or has made, any representations or warranties relating to
itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger and Parent,
Holdings and Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty
except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement, (ii) no Person has
been authorized by the Company to make any representation or warranty relating
to itself or its Subsidiaries or its business or otherwise in connection with
the Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied
upon by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub as having been authorized by the
Company, and (iii) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial
information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information
provided or addressed to Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their Agents
are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or
warranties, including any representations or warranties relating to the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
related information.

Section 4.02 No Solicitation.

(a) On the date hereof the Company will instruct and cause the Company's
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, brokers, consultants and other representatives or
advisors (collectively, "Agents"), its Subsidiaries and their respective
Agents to immediately cease all discussions and negotiations with any Persons
that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and deliver a written
notice to each such Person to the effect that the Company is ending all
discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Takeover
Proposal and such notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries.



(b) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries' Agents to (i)
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
reasonably be likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (which for the purposes
of this subclause and subclause (ii) shall not include providing information
to a member of the Board in his capacity as a director), (ii) provide any non-
public information, or afford access to the properties, books, records, or
personnel of the Company or 

any of its Subsidiaries, to any Person that the Company has reason to believe

maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any Person in furtherance

offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (v)
amend or waive any standstill or similar provision of any agreement with
respect to any equity of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (vi) resolve or

on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date hereof (the "Go Shop End
Date"), the Company may directly or indirectly through advisors, Agents or
other intermediaries (i) solicit, encourage and facilitate a Takeover Proposal
from any Person, (ii) provide non-public information or data to any Person
with which it has entered into a confidentiality agreement with provisions
relating to confidentiality that are no less favorable to the Company than the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement shall contain provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 4.02
hereunder) (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") and afford access to
the properties, books, records, or personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a
Takeover Proposal with any such Person; provided that the Company shall
simultaneously provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public
information that is provided to any such Person which has not previously been
provided to Parent and Merger Sub. In addition, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 4.02, if the Board receives a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal from any Person following the Go Shop End Date, which
Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 4.02 by the
Company or its Agents, then the Company may, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, furnish non-public information to the Person making
such Takeover Proposal and afford access to the properties, books, records,
and personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, and enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person in connection with a Takeover
Proposal provided that the Company shall simultaneously provide to



Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information that is provided to
any such Person which has not previously been provided to Parent and Merger
Sub; and provided, however, that prior to taking any of the foregoing actions,
(i) the Board has determined in good faith that such Takeover Proposal is, or
could reasonably be likely to lead to the delivery of, a Superior Proposal,
and (ii) the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
legal advisors) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(d) The Company will notify Parent orally and in writing promptly after
receipt (and in any event within twenty‑four (24) hours) by the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Agents) of any Takeover Proposal (or
modification or amendment thereof), or the granting of any access to non-
public information of the Company and its Subsidiaries or access to their
books and records, business property or assets and shall specify the identity
of the Party making the Takeover Proposal or receiving such access and the
material terms thereof. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
current basis, of the status of any such Takeover Proposal or access
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and any modifications
thereto). The Company shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48)
hours prior notice of any meeting of the Board at which the Board is
reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that
it will not enter into any confidentiality agreement after the date of this
Agreement that would prevent the Company from complying with this Section
4.02(d).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement: 

(i) "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of
interest from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group",
within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) sale, lease,
exchange, transfer, license (other than licenses in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the Company's consolidated assets or to
which 20% or more of the Company's net revenues or net income on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of 10% or more (or, in
the case of any person beneficially owning (for purposes of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of
the date of this Agreement, any additional shares of any class of outstanding
voting or equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 10% or more (or, in the case of any person beneficially
owning (for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) 10% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement, any
additional shares) of any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) liquidation, dissolution,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend or other significant corporate
reorganization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the business of



which constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (E) any combination of the
foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated
assets, net revenues or net income and Company Common Stock involved is 20% or
more; in each case, other than the Transaction;

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a written, bona fide proposal or offer, or
series of related proposals or offers, made by any Person or "group" (as such
term is defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) to consummate an
Acquisition Transaction, which, in the good faith determination of the Board,
taking into consideration the various legal, financial, and regulatory aspects
of such Acquisition Transaction and the Person or group making the proposal or
proposals for such Acquisition Transaction (including any required financing,
stockholder approval requirements of the Person or group making the proposal,
regulatory approvals, stockholder litigation, breakup fee and expense
reimbursement provisions, expected timing and risk and likelihood of
consummation, and, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Board, such other
factors that may be considered in making such a determination under the DGCL)
(A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated and (B) if
consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the
Transaction; and

(iii) "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean a merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, sale or disposition
or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to which a Person (or its stockholders) would own, if consummated,
all or substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company (or
of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the
surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(f) Except as permitted by Section 4.02(g), neither the Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i)(A) fail to make, amend, change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to amend, change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, or (B) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend to the stockholders of the
Company any Takeover Proposal, Acquisition Transaction or Superior Proposal,
(ii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender or exchange offer for
the Company Common Stock within 10 business days after commencement of such
offer, (iii) make any public statement inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (actions described in clauses (i)-(iii) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), (iv) authorize, cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Agents to enter
into any Acquisition Agreement, (v) take any action pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii) or (vi) resolve to do any of the foregoing. 



(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
including Section 4.02(f), prior to the Go Shop End Date, the Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change: (i) in order to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction in connection
with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii) if the
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, (A) that failure to take such action is
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B)
that such Acquisition Transaction constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that prior to taking such action (1) the Company has given Parent at
least four (4) calendar days' prior written notice of its intention to take
such action (which notice shall include a copy of the Superior Proposal, a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto), (2) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Agents to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement and any other agreements
relating to the Transaction such that it would cause such Acquisition
Transaction to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following the end
of such notice period, the Board shall have considered in good faith any
proposed revisions to this Agreement and any other agreements relating to the
transaction contemplated hereby proposed in writing by Parent in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have
determined, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition
Transaction would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions
were to be given effect and (4) in the event of any change to the material
terms of such Acquisition Transaction, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (1) above and the notice period shall have recommenced, except that the
notice period shall be at least three (3) calendar days (rather than four (4)
calendar days contemplated by clause (1) above); and provided, further, that
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 4.02; or (ii) the Board determines in good faith that such change
is reasonably required, after consultation with its legal counsel, to comply
with its fiduciary duties.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that any
disclosures permitted under this Section 4.02(h) that does not contain either
an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of
the Company) in which the Company indicates that it has not changed the
Company Recommendation.



ARTICLE V.



ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 5.01 Stockholder Consent; Preparation of Information Statement.

(a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of calling a
meeting of the Company's stockholders, the Company shall seek and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain an irrevocable written consent, in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B, from the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (such written consent, as duly executed and
delivered by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, the "Stockholder Consent"). As soon as practicable upon receipt of the
Stockholder Consent, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of such
Stockholder Consent, certified as true and complete by an executive officer of
the Company. If such Stockholder Consent is not delivered to the Company and
Parent within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution of this Agreement
(the "Stockholder Consent Delivery Period"), Parent shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 7.01(b)(iii). In connection
with the Stockholder Consent, the Company shall take all actions 

necessary to comply, and shall comply in all respects, with the DGCL,
including Section 228 and Section 262 thereof, and the Company's certificate
of incorporation, bylaws or like organizational documents.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within thirty (30) days after the date hereof), the Company
shall, with the assistance (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of Parent, prepare and file with the SEC the Information
Statement. The Information Statement shall also contain (i) the notice of
action by written consent required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and (ii) the
notice of availability of appraisal rights and related disclosure required by
Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company will
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Information Statement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will cause the
information relating to Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub supplied by it for
inclusion in the Information Statement, at the time of the mailing of the
Information Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, not to contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Information Statement promptly following request therefor from
the Company. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Information Statement as promptly
as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to have the Information
Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing. Each of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Information Statement which shall have become materially false or misleading.



The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Parent, Holdings
and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Information Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the
Information Statement or for additional information and shall provide Parent
with copies of all such comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or
mailing the Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and to propose comments on such document or response and shall, in good faith,
consider the reasonable comments of Parent. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Information Statement has been cleared by the SEC or
after ten (10) calendar days have passed since the date of filing of the
preliminary Information Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC of
its intent to review the Information Statement, the Company shall promptly
file with the SEC the Information Statement in definitive form as contemplated
by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in the form
previously cleared or filed with the SEC, as the case may be, and mail a copy
of the Information Statement to the Company's stockholders of record in
accordance with Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL. In the event the Stockholder
Consent is not obtained and Parent does not terminate this Agreement, in each
case, as provided in Section 5.01(a), then as soon as practicable after the
conclusion of the Stockholder Consent Delivery Period, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement related to the Merger and this
Agreement (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement
thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and shall take all action necessary to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of adopting this Agreement (the "Stockholders' Meeting") and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain Stockholder Approval.

Section 5.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Subject to restrictions under applicable Law, the Company shall afford to
Parent, and to Parent's officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors, and their respective Agents, including the Debt Financing Sources
(provided, however, that the Debt Financing Sources may only be provided with
confidential information subject to customary confidentiality undertakings
reasonably acceptable to the Company) reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company 

during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement, to all of its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of Federal or state securities laws (unless such document is publicly
available), (ii) a copy of each material correspondence or written
communication with any United States Federal or state governmental agency, and
(iii) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however,
that that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to such information or
personnel to the extent that such disclosure



would, based on the advice of legal counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-
client privilege, the work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege
applicable to such information.

(b) Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated March 21, 2014, between the Company and
Parent (as amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent
shall hold, and shall cause Holdings, Merger Sub and its, Holdings' and Merger
Sub's respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other Agents to hold, all information received from the Company, directly
or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 or information provided or
received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed to
constitute an exception to any of the representations or warranties of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto, constitute a waiver of any breach thereof
or otherwise affect or limit the remedies available to Parent, Holdings or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 5.03 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its respective reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable; (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and
the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity; and
(iii) the delivery of required notices to and the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties under any Material Contract
or Company Lease or otherwise to the extent related to the Merger; provided
that none of the Company, Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub shall be required to
make any payment to any such third parties or concede anything of value to
obtain such consents.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing:

(i) Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) make or cause to be made all
filings required of each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
and, in any event, within ten (10) business days



after the date of this Agreement in the case of all filings required under the
HSR Act and within thirty (30) days in the case of all other filings required
by other Antitrust Laws, (B) comply at the earliest practicable date with any
request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws for additional information,
documents, or other materials received by each of them or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust 

Division") or any other Governmental Entity in respect of such filings or such
transactions, and (C) cooperate with each other in connection with any such
filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing copies
of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Each such party shall furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of
any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or any such
transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with a
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analysis,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to
proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.

(ii) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Laws that
are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust
Laws"). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of
the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to
such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
none of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be
required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement,



condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license,
assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any material
assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, (ii) materially conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
materially change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in any adverse manner, or (iii) impose any material
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Holdings, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided that,
if requested by Parent, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or
offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on the Company in the event the Closing occurs.

(iv) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Governmental Authorizations and
all other consents, approvals and agreements of, and to give and make all
notices and filings with, any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including: (i) not later than thirty (30) days following the date of this
Agreement, Parent filing, or causing to be filed, "Form A Statements" or
similar change of control applications, with the insurance commissioners or 

departments of health or other Governmental Entities in each jurisdiction
where required by applicable Law seeking approval of Parent's acquisition of
control of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries which results from the Merger;
(ii) as promptly as practicable, Parent filing, or causing to be filed, any
pre-acquisition notifications on "Form E" or similar market share
notifications to be filed in each jurisdiction where required by applicable
Laws with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain all other approvals and consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the matters set forth
on Section 3.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and Section 3.02(b) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

Section 5.04 Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation and
Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective
Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnitee" and,
collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (1) the
fact that



an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (2) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any Company Benefit Plan), in each case under (1) or
(2), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time as provided in (1) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company and the organizational documents of its Subsidiaries as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, and (2) any indemnification agreement between any
such Indemnitee and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, which agreements shall survive the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and continue in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms. In addition, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay any expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.04
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this Section 5.04) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of, and all
limitations on the personal liability of, each Indemnified Party provided for
in this Section 5.04 or in the respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof (including through
any indemnification agreement) shall not be modified, and shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of 6 years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitations on personal liability in respect of
any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For the 6-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any
additional 

persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or Parent
may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least
the same coverage required above with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time); provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to
make



annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
300% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (such 300% amount, the "Base Premium"); and provided further that,
if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed the Base
Premium, then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the
applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an
annual premium equal to the Base Premium. Prior to the Effective Time Parent
or the Company may purchase, for an aggregate amount that shall not exceed the
Base Premium, a 6-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing
at least materially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by Parent or the
Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations of the Parent to obtain
insurance pursuant to this Section 5.04. The Surviving Corporation shall not
amend, modify, cancel or revoke such policy and each shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect,
for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.04 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.04 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 5.04 applies unless (A) such termination or modification is required
by applicable Law, or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in
writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.04 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.04).

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.04.

Section 5.05 Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, Parent shall pay
all of the filing fees and expenses for Parent's pre-merger notification and
report forms under the HSR Act; provided, further, that the Company shall pay



all of the fees and expenses in connection with preparation of the Company's
pre-merger notification and report forms under the HSR Act, if any.

Section 5.06 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that (a) a party may,
without the prior written consent of the other party, issue such press release
or make such public statement as may be required by Law or the applicable
rules of any stock exchange 

if the party issuing such press release or making such public statement has
used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain
such party's consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner, and (b)
the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, and in
compliance with any applicable notification provisions in Section 4.02, issue
such press release or make such public statement release or announcement with
respect to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected in accordance with
Section 4.02(g). The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

Section 5.07 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party's knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or, in the case of the Company, a Company Subsidiary, and, in the case of
Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries, which
relate to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and (c) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty or
breach of covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement at any time during
the term hereof that could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set
forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 not to be satisfied. In no event shall
disclosure by the Company or Parent pursuant to this Section 5.07 be deemed to
amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty.

Section 5.08 Employee Matters.

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time, the employees of the Company who remain in the employment of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the
"Continuing Employees") shall



receive compensation and employee benefits (other than equity‑based
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to the employees of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of
each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent for
purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit accruals (other than benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plans) in any benefit plan, program
or policy covering that Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, but
not for the purposes of benefit accruals that would result in duplication of
benefits.

(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific person; provided, however, that Surviving
Corporation will, and Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to, comply with
terms and conditions of employment, severance and other compensatory
agreements or arrangements with any directors or employees of the Company that
are in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are listed in Section
5.08(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.08 will create any third-party beneficiary right
for the benefit of any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, or any
right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 5.08 or any
other provision of this Agreement (i) will be construed to establish, amend,
or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
or (ii) will limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them.



Section 5.09 State Takeover Laws. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover applicable Law becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of
the Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
anti-takeover applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 5.10 Director Resignations. Prior to the Closing, other than with
respect to any directors identified by Parent in writing to the Company two
(2) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent resignations executed by each
director of the Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time.

Section 5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and in accordance with the Interpretative Letter dated
January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect
to equity securities of the Company) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities
of the Company.

Section 5.12 Fixed/Floating Rate Senior Debentures. The Company shall timely
provide or cause to be provided, in accordance with the provisions of the
indentures relating to LOTS Intermediate Co.'s Fixed/Floating Rate Senior
Debentures due 2037 (the "Indenture"), to the trustee under the Indenture, any
notices, announcements, certificates or legal opinions required by the
Indenture to be provided in connection with the Merger prior to the Effective
Time. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any such notice, announcement, certificate or legal opinion, in
each case before such document is provided to such trustee, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent and its counsel.

Section 5.13 Company's Financial Cooperation Covenant.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Section 5.13, prior to the Closing, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Debt Financing Sources and their respective
Agents in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or Alternative
Financing (as defined below) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent with
reasonable advance notice, and at Parent's sole cost and expense, including
by:



(i) participating at reasonable times in reasonable number of meetings,
drafting sessions, presentations, road shows, rating agency presentations and
due diligence sessions;

(ii) furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing Sources as promptly as
reasonably practical with (x) the financial statements regarding the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in
paragraph 6(a) of the Conditions Annex of the Debt Commitment Letter (or the
analogous provision in any amendment, modification, supplement, restatement or
replacement thereof permitted or required pursuant to Section 5.14(b)), (y)
all information contemplated by paragraph 8 of the 

Conditions Annex of the Debt Commitment Letter (or the analogous provision in
any amendment, modification, supplement, restatement or replacement thereof

obligations shall not include any actions that the Company reasonably believes
would result in a violation of any material agreement, any confidentiality

Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to the Debt Financing
Sources and other potential sources of capital, rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during the marketing or syndication of the
Debt Financing subject to their entering into customary confidentiality
undertakings with 

respect to such information (including through a notice and undertaking in a
form customarily used in confidential information memoranda therefor). The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or

Section 5.14 Parent's Financing Covenant.

(a) Parent shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein,
including the following:

(i) complying with and maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter;

(ii) negotiating and entering into definitive financing agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto), as
amended from time to time in accordance with this Section 5.14 so that such
agreements are in full force and effect on the Closing Date;

(iii) satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions within its control
(provided that this clause (iii) shall not impair the rights of Parent
pursuant to ARTICLE VI of this Agreement);

(iv) in the event that the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI and the
Financing Conditions have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding and at
Closing would be satisfied, using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Debt Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing; and

(v) reduce the aggregate amount of Indebtedness to be incurred in the Debt
Financing used to finance the Merger Consideration by an amount sufficient
such that the condition in paragraph 7 of the Conditions Annex of the Debt
Commitment Letter shall be satisfied immediately after giving effect to the
Transaction, if all conditions to Closing (other than those that require
deliveries or are tested at the time of Closing, which



conditions would have been satisfied if the Closing had occurred at such time)
under this Agreement shall have been satisfied or waived and all conditions to
the Debt Financing shall have been satisfied (other than the condition in
paragraph 7 of the Conditions Annex of the Debt Commitment Letter and
conditions that require deliveries or are tested at the time of Closing, which
conditions would have been satisfied if the Closing had occurred at such
time), provided, that Parent shall make up any shortfall through the use of
cash on hand by the Parent in an amount necessary, when combined with the
proceeds of the Debt Financing, to enable the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, and not proceeds of the Debt Financing that would cause the
condition in paragraph 7 of the Conditions Annex of the Debt Commitment Letter
to not be satisfied).

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates or Agents shall take any action
that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that a Financing Failure Event occurs, Parent shall
(i) immediately notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the
reasons therefor, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
alternative financing from alternative financing sources (on terms, when taken
as a whole, not materially less favorable to Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and
the Company, and which do not include any conditions to the consummation of
such alternative debt financing that, when taken as a whole, are more onerous,
than those in the Debt Commitment Letters and which do not contain any
conditions that, when considered with the other conditions taken as a whole,
would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the availability of
the Debt Financing or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), in an amount sufficient, when taken together
with the remaining portion of the Debt Financing and the other funds available
to Parent, to pay any amounts required to be paid by or on behalf of Parent in
connection with the Closing and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, as promptly 

as practicable following the occurrence of such Financing Failure Event and in
any event no later than the End Date (any such financing, an "Alternative
Financing"), and (iii) obtain and, when obtained, provide the Company with a
copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative
Financing. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the
Company, except for substitutions or replacements pursuant to this Section
5.14 in connection with an Alternative Financing, Parent shall not (A) agree
to, or permit, any amendment, modification, supplement, restatement,
assignment, substitution, replacement or waiver of or under, the Debt
Commitment Letter, if such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement,
assignment, substitution, replacement, or waiver (1) adds new (or adversely
modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing
that, when considered with the other Debt Financing Conditions taken as a
whole, would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the
availability of the Debt Financing or otherwise adversely affect the ability
or likelihood of Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or make the satisfaction of the
Financing Conditions less likely



to occur; (2) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing; (3) adversely affects
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter as so amended, modified, supplemented restated, assigned,
substituted, replaced, or waived, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights against such other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof; or (4) would reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise adversely affect the ability or
likelihood of Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or make the satisfaction of the
Financing Conditions less likely to occur; or (B) terminate the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that Parent shall have the right to release or
consent to assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the
terms of or in connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing or as
otherwise expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. Upon any such
amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, assignment, substitution,
replacement or waiver of the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with
this Section 5.14, the term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall mean the Debt
Financing Commitments as so amended, modified, supplemented restated,
assigned, substituted, replaced, or waived.

(c) Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of (A) any
material breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Financing, if any, of which Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub has Knowledge
or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent, Holdings or
Merger Sub has Knowledge, (B) the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to (1) any
actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing, if any, of any provision
thereof, and (2) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing, if any, with
respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt
Financing to be funded at Closing, in the case of clauses (1) and (2) that
would reasonably be expected to result in Merger Sub not receiving the
proceeds of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to consummate the
Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent with this
Section 5.14(c) shall not relieve Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub of its
respective obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the time specified in Section 1.02, whether or not the Debt
Financing is available, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VI.

Section 5.15 Stockholder Litigation. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of (and, if entered, to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned) any injunction, order, ruling,
decree, judgment or similar order that results from any stockholder litigation
against the Company, Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, any of their Affiliates or
any of their respective directors or officers 

relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the



other promptly of the commencement of any such stockholder or derivative suit,
action, litigation or claim of which it has received written notice related to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

disbursements) in connection with such suit.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Reverse Termination Fee" means an amount

Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company and their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, members or stockholders; provided, however, that (i) the agreements
contained in Section 5.02(b), Section 5.05, Section 7.02, Section 7.04 and
ARTICLE VIII shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) none of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved from liabilities or
damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and that nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit either party from seeking to prove that such damages
include the benefit of the bargain lost by such party or such party's
stockholders) arising out of the willful and material breach by such party of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, subject to Sections 7.04(b), 7.04(c) and 8.12(c);
provided, further, that the failure of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger after all conditions in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 have been
satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied upon Closing and other than as a
result of a failure of the Parent and Merger Sub to receive the proceeds of

and Merger Sub of this Agreement.

(b) The parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to
this Agreement and the



Transaction in the event any payment of the Termination Fee becomes due and
payable under the terms of this Agreement, and, upon payment of the
Termination Fee the Company shall have no further liability to Parent and
Merger Sub hereunder. The parties agree that the payment of the Termination
Fee in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee becomes payable,
constitutes liquidated damages and is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Parent and Merger Sub for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the 

avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.04 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, none of the Debt Financing Sources or their
current or future direct or indirect holders of any equity, partnership or
limited liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds,
representatives (including legal counsel), members, managers, general or
limited partners, stockholders or assignees shall have any liability to the
Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

(c) The parties agree that the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company with respect to this
Agreement and the Transaction in the event any payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee becomes due and payable under the terms of this Agreement,
and, upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, none of Parent, Holdings,
Merger Sub or, without derogation of Section 8.11(c) or the last sentence of
this Section 7.04(c), the Debt Financing Sources, shall have any further
liability to the Company hereunder. The parties agree that the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee in the circumstances in which the Reverse Termination
Fee becomes payable, constitutes liquidated damages and is not a penalty, but
rather a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of
doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.04 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, none of the Debt Financing Sources or their current or future
direct or indirect holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability
company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds, representatives (including
legal counsel), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders
or assignees shall have any liability to the Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under this Section 7.04(c) relating to or
arising out of or in connection with the Reverse Termination Fee.

and signed by each party to any Debt Commitment Letter issued in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.12 Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages
or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
It is accordingly agreed that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 7.01 (i) the parties shall be entitled to seek (in
a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 8.12(d)) an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without bond or other
security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to which they
are entitled pursuant to Section 7.02, Section 7.03 and/or Section 7.04, but
subject in all cases to Section 8.12(b), (c) and (d) below and (ii) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent nor Holdings nor Merger Sub would
have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly further agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable remedy to specifically enforce the Parent's, Holdings' and Merger
Sub's obligations to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth
herein (as opposed to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedy to force Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub to comply with their other
obligations set forth herein) only in the event that all conditions in Section
6.01 and Section 6.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of
which is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date) at 

the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the
Parent to comply with its obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement.



(b) Each of the Company, Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that the payment of the Termination Fee and Reverse Termination Fee, as
applicable, as provided in Sections 7.02, 7.04(b) and 7.04(c), constitutes the
sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement and with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the party to whom payment
thereof has become due and payable. Each of the Company, Parent, Holdings and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that in all other circumstances, the
parties' only remedies under this Agreement and with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be (i) prior to a valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01, the equitable
remedies to the extent provided in Section 8.12(a), and (ii) following a valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01, the right to
seek monetary damages for a willful and material breach of this Agreement to
the extent provided in Section 7.04(a) and subject to the limitations provided
in Section 8.12(c); provided, however, that in no event shall any party be
entitled to receive both of the remedies set forth in the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii) (but such party may seek the remedies set forth in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) until one of them is awarded). For the avoidance of doubt
and notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.12(b) or elsewhere in this
Agreement, none of the Debt Financing Sources and their current and future
direct or indirect holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability
company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds, representatives (including
legal counsel), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
or assignees shall have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby.

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery court of the State of Delaware and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in
connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons
and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. Without limiting
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, suit or proceeding of any kind, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Financing Documents, including, without limitation, any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof), and that the
provisions of Section 8.13 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to
any such action, suit or proceeding.



Section 8.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY
AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DEBT
FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING DOCUMENTS). EACH PARTY HERETO
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO 

ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 8.13.

Section 8.14 Severability. If any term, condition or other provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term, condition or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

Form of

Written Consent of Stockholders

In Lieu of Meeting



The undersigned (the "Stockholders"), being the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Fortegra Financial
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby irrevocably
consent in writing, pursuant to Section 228(a) and Section 251 of the General

forth in the Merger Agreement;



WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger
(the "Effective Time"), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share

interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable Law
(the "Merger Consideration");



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion of

forth therein;



WHEREAS, the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast thereon by the stockholders of
the Company is required pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL; and



WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Section
251(d) of the DGCL, the Board of Directors of the Company has the power to
terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances after the
Stockholder Approval is obtained by this written consent, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

FURTHER RESOLVED, that the undersigned Stockholders hereby expressly waive in
all respects, and shall not assert, any and all rights of appraisal (and
