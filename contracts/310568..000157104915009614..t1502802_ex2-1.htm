---|---|--- 

 



    



  

for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn promptly following the expiration of the Offer; _provided_
,  _however_ , that without the prior written consent of the Company, Sub
shall not accept for payment or pay for any shares of Company Common Stock
if, as a result, Sub would acquire less than the number of shares of Company
Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The time at which
Sub first accepts for payment the shares of Company Common Stock tendered
in the Offer is referred to as the " _Acceptance Time._ " If payment of the
Per Share Amount is to be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Amount to a person
other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall
have established to the satisfaction of Sub that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. The Company shall register (and shall instruct
its transfer agent to register) in the name of Sub the shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment by Sub immediately after the Acceptance
Time. 

  



  

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within
twenty (20) Business Days, after the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form Sâ4 to
register the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and
the Merger (the " _Registration Statement_ "). The Registration Statement
will include a preliminary prospectus containing the information required
under Rule 14dâ4(b) under the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary Prospectus_

cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer, which will contain or incorporate by reference the
Preliminary Prospectus and forms of the related letter of transmittal and

exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto being referred to collectively in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Sub shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Offer Documents
to comply in all material respects with applicable Law. The Company and its
counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Registration Statement and the Offer Documents (including all amendments and
supplements thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and
Sub shall promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy or a
description of any comments received by Parent, Sub or their counsel from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement or the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent and Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Registration Statement, the Offer Documents or the Offer. To the extent
required by applicable Law, each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to (1) correct promptly any information provided by
it for use in the Registration Statement or the Offer Documents to the extent
that it becomes aware that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and (2) take all steps necessary to
promptly cause the Registration Statement and the Offer Documents, as
supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock. The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Sub all information concerning
the Company and the

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Company's stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 2.1(g)_.
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after its
filing and to maintain its effectiveness for so long as shall be required for
the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger.
Following the time the Registration Statement is declared effective,
Parent shall file the final prospectus included therein under Rule 424(b)
under the Securities Act.

  



  

(h) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Time,
any change in the number of issued or outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share split), or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share dividend or
share distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock) with a record
date during such period, the Per Share Amount shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change.

  



  

(i) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued in
connection with the Offer, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common
Stock that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall in lieu of such
fractional share, be paid an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average trading price of Parent Common
Stock on Nasdaq for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 2.2 Company Action.

  



  

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves the Offer pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby further consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of such approval and Board Recommendation,
_provided_ that the Company shall not have withdrawn or modified such Board

The Company shall not withdraw or modify such Board Recommendation in any
manner adverse to Sub or Parent except as provided in _Section 7.3(e)_ or
_Section 7.3(f)_. 

  



  

(b) Promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO by Sub, the
Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_") containing, except as provided in _Section 7.3(e)_ or
_Section 7.3(f)_, Board Recommendation. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC
on the same day as the Schedule TO shall be filed with the SEC. The Company
shall promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock together with the Offer Documents and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated in
all material respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. The
Company shall also include a notice, in compliance with Section 251(h) and
Section 262 of the DGCL, of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger
under the DGCL. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each
case in all material respects as required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent or Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Sub that is required or reasonably requested by the
Company in connection with its obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9.
The Company shall give Parent, Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC.
In addition, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent, Sub and their counsel
in writing with any written comments the Company or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii) use reasonable best
efforts to provide Parent, Sub and their counsel a reasonably detailed
description of any oral comments the Company or its counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii) unless there has been
a Change of Recommendation, provide Parent, Sub and their counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral response to such
comments or any proposed amendment to the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC.

  



  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish
or cause to be furnished (including by instructing its transfer agent to
promptly furnish) to Sub mailing labels containing the names and addresses of
all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and with security
position listings of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock
depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other available
listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position
listings of record holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of shares of
Company Common Stock. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Sub such additional information,
including updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels
and security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as Parent or Sub
may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of Law, including
applicable stock exchange rules, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence
the information contained in such labels, listings and files and shall use
such information only in connection with the Transactions. If the Offer is
terminated or if this Agreement shall be terminated, Sub and Parent will
promptly deliver and cause their Representatives to deliver to the Company
(and delete electronic copies of) all copies, summaries and extracts of such
information then in their possession or control.

Article IV

  



  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  



  

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company
as treasury shares and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Sub or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the
Effective Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock then
issued and outstanding (other than Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section 4.1(b) _and Dissenting Shares) shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Amount (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and
the holders of Book Entry Shares and the holders of certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Company
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto other than the right to receive, upon transfer of such Book
Entry Shares or delivery of such Certificates in accordance with _Section
4.2_, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such
share of the Company Common Stock.

  



  

(d) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by
virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Common Stock
that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that
otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such
holder's Certificate(s) or Book Entry Share(s) or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner
provided in Section 4.2(g), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average trading price of
Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq for the five (5) consecutive trading days
ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date hereof.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a United States
bank or trust company or other independent financial institution in the
United States (the " _Paying and Exchange Agent_ ") that is
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act, among other things, as paying
agent and exchange agent for the Merger and to deliver the
Merger Consideration to former stockholders of the Company. The Company and
Parent shall enter into a Paying and Exchange Agent agreement with the Paying
and Exchange Agent, which agreement shall set forth the duties,
responsibilities and obligations of the Paying and Exchange Agent consistent
with the terms of this Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time on the
Closing Date, Parent

  



    

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying and Exchange Agent,
for the account and benefit of the former holders of Company Common
Stock, the aggregate Cash Consideration payable and the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this _Article IV_, in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be
paid by the Paying and Exchange Agent in accordance with this Agreement (such
cash and Parent Common Stock shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Consideration Fund_ "). In addition, Parent shall make available as
necessary cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions which
holders of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to _Section
4.2(h)_. In the event the Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay
the Merger Consideration (including with respect to Company Common Stock held
by stockholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger but who did not
exercise, or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, their rights to
appraisal of such Company Common Stock under the DGCL), Parent shall promptly
deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds and shares of Parent
Common Stock to the Paying and Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to
the deficiency required to make such payments.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
Paying and Exchange Agent to mail to each stockholder whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
4.1_: (i) a letter of transmittal, in customary form, that shall specify that
delivery of such Certificates or transfer of such Book Entry Shares shall be
deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the
Book Entry Shares to the Paying and Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and
substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be as
reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to the
Closing. Upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying and Exchange
Agent in connection with the transfer of a Book Entry Share or surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying and Exchange Agent, in each
case together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as
may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book Entry
Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IV_, and the Book Entry Share so
transferred or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or Certificates in
connection with, or accrued on, the Merger Consideration, any cash paid in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares or dividends or distributions
payable with respect to Share Consideration. If any Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the stockholder in whose name the Book Entry
Share transferred or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying and Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the stockholder owning the Book
Entry Share transferred or Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying and Exchange Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

  



    

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The cash in the Consideration Fund shall be invested by the
Paying and Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United
States with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the
United States and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
Earnings on the Consideration Fund in excess of the amounts payable to the
Company's former stockholders shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent and shall be paid as Parent directs. No investment of the
Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying and Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required by this
_Article IV_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Paying and Exchange Agent
for the benefit of the Company's stockholders at the Effective Time in the
amount of such losses to the extent the funds in the Consideration Fund are
insufficient for such purposes, which additional funds will be deemed to be
part of the Consideration Fund.

  



  

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the share transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying and Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this _Article IV_, except as otherwise provided by Law.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of
any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former
Company stockholders one (1) year after the Effective Time shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for no consideration. Any Company stockholder owning Certificates
or Book Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_
with respect to such Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying and Exchange
Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash
from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book Entry Share shall not have been surrendered or transferred, respectively,
prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to applicable Law, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and any
stockholder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article IV_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

  



  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (which affidavit shall be in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying and Exchange Agent) by
the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying and Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is
entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article IV_.

  



    

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made
after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or
other distribution in respect of all Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time, and no payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 4.1(d)_ will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Book Entry Shares with respect to Parent Common Stock
represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates or Book
Entry Shares shall surrender such Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Subject
to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificates or Book
Entry Shares, the Paying and Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holders
thereof, without interest (i) promptly after such surrender, the Cash
Consideration payable and the Share Consideration payable in exchange
therefor, in each case pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_, along with payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(d)_ and the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time and theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 4.1_, but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with Section 262;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1_. The Company shall
provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by the
Company. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in and direct any and all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Neither the Company nor Parent
shall, without the prior written consent of the other party, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands
or applications, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 4.4 _Treatment of Company Stock Options; Company
Restricted Stock Units; and Company Performance Restricted Stock Units_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, (i) to
the extent unvested, be fully vested, and (ii) be cancelled and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive Option

  



    

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other
amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld (which withholding
shall first be applied against the cash portion of the Option
Consideration)). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Option Consideration for
any Company Option is zero or a negative number, such Company Option will be
cancelled at the Effective Time without any payment therefor. Following the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Stock Option shall no longer be
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock and shall only entitle the
holder of such Company Stock Option to the payment described in this _Section
4.4(a)_, which shall be made by the Surviving Corporation as of, or within
two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested
Company Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into that number of Parent restricted stock
units of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, ("
_Converted RSUs_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Units and (y)
the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio, and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing
(i) the Cash Consideration by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price. Any
Converted RSUs issued pursuant to this _Section 4.4(b)_ shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company
Restricted Stock Units (including any applicable change of control or other
accelerated vesting provisions, and this transaction shall constitute a
change of control for all relevant provisions that accelerate vesting), with
the terms and conditions modified as appropriate to reflect the assumption;
provided, that all references to the "Company" in the applicable
Company Equity Plans and award agreements will be references to Parent. Each
Converted RSU that vests after the Effective Time shall be settled in shares
of Parent Common Stock; provided, that in the event that Parent shall
reasonably determine at any time prior to the Effective Time that it would
not be permitted to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior approval of Parent's stockholders under
applicable Laws or the rules of Nasdaq, Parent shall have the power to
provide that any such Converted RSU that vests after the Effective Time shall
be settled by a cash payment equal to the value of a share of Parent Common
Stock at the time of such settlement.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Company
Restricted Stock Unit (including those Company Restricted Stock Units
that become vested by their terms immediately prior to or as of the Effective
Time) shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be
cancelled and extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other
amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld, which withholding shall
first be applied against the cash portion of the consideration paid in
respect of a vested Company Restricted Stock Unit) (i) an amount in
cash equal to the product of (A) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (B) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Unit, and (ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the (A) Share Consideration and (B) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Unit, _provided_  that any fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
resulting from such product should be treated consistently with _Section
4.1(d)_ hereof. The payment described in this _Section 4.4(c)_ shall be
made by the Surviving Corporation in the next practicable payroll following
the Effective Time; _provided_ , that payment shall be made at such other time
or times following the Effective Time consistent with the terms of the
Company

Restricted Stock Unit to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of
additional income tax under Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the unvested
Company Performance Restricted Stock Units outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be assumed and converted into that number of
restricted stock units of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest
whole share (" _Converted PRSUs_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Restricted
Stock Units, assuming achievement of target-level performance with respect to
each performance period, performance cycle or measurement cycle applicable to
such Company Performance Restricted Stock Units and (y) the Equity Conversion
Ratio. Any Converted PRSUs issued pursuant to this _Section 4.4(d)_ shall
continue to be subject to the vesting schedule applicable to the Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units, including that the Converted PRSUs will
be settled no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) calendar
month following the applicable vesting date (or as otherwise required by the
applicable award agreement) subject only to the continued service of the
grantee with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an Affiliate through each
applicable vesting date or measurement cycle end date but shall not be
subject to any performance metrics following the Effective Time, and shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (modified as
appropriate to reflect the assumption) as were applicable under such Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units (after giving effect to and including any
applicable change of control or other accelerated vesting provisions, for
which purposes this transaction shall constitute a change of control);
_provided_ , that all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company
Equity Plans and award agreements will be references to Parent. Each Converted
PRSU that vests after the Effective Time shall be settled in shares of Parent
Common Stock; provided, that in the event that Parent shall reasonably
determine at any time prior to the Effective Time that it would not be
permitted to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior approval of Parent's stockholders under applicable
Laws or the rules of Nasdaq, Parent shall have the power to provide that any
such Converted PRSU that vests after the Effective Time shall be settled by a
cash payment equal to the value of a share of Parent Common Stock at the time
of such settlement.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary (including obtaining any required consents) to effectuate the
provisions set forth in this _Section 4.4_; _provided_ , that no action taken
by the Company shall be required to be irrevocable until immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time. The parties shall, to the extent reasonably practicable,
cooperate in good faith prior to the Effective Time to develop mechanisms
with respect to any Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and
Company Performance Restricted Stock Units held by individuals subject to the
Laws of a country other than the United States to mitigate the tax impact of
the provisions set forth in this _Section 4.4_ and adhere to applicable Law
(without creating obligations that extend to future grants).

  



  

Section 4.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Paying and Exchange Agent,
Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any Merger Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required under the Code or any other

treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

_Company Special Shares_ ") of PMC-Sierra, Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary of the
Company, shall remain outstanding, and subject to and from and after the
Effective Time, the holders of each Company Special Share shall be entitled
to receive, upon the exchange or retraction (i.e., redemption at the option
of the holder) thereof, in lieu of each share of Company Common Stock that
would have been issuable in respect of such redacted Company Special Shares,
(a) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Cash Consideration, and
(b) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio, times (y) the applicable exchange ratio under that certain
Exchange Agreement, dated as of September 2, 1994, as amended (the " _Exchange
Agreement_ ") among the Company, PMC-Sierra, Ltd. and the other parties
thereto, in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement.

economic terms that do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability

such Person is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including,

absolute and matured, (c) such Person has not incurred, and does not intend to
incur, debts or liabilities beyond such Person's ability to pay such debts
and liabilities as they mature and (d) such Person is not engaged in

business or a transaction, and is not about to engage in business or a

small capital. The amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be
computed under this _Section 6.14_ as the amount that, in the light of all
the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that
is probable to become an actual or matured liability.

(" _Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable access, in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such
period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly
to such Representatives all information concerning the business, properties
and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries in each case as may
reasonably be requested for reasonable purposes related to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to disclose any information to Parent or Sub if such disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, be expected to (i) violate applicable Law
or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement (as long as the
Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the
other party to the agreement), or (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client, work product doctrine or other legal privilege held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any
invasive additional diligence investigation after the date of this Agreement,
including investigations or sampling at any property owned, operated or
leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent
of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use its reasonable efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver
of such privilege. The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to
information furnished hereunder by or on behalf of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Company's Representatives (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement). The Company

  



    

 | 58|

agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended to permit the
inclusion of all actual or prospective sources of debt financing (including
convertible or equity-linked debt) (and representatives of such financing
sources) in the term "Representative" as such term is defined therein.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers,
directors, employees and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
(i) initiate, solicit, seek or knowingly take any action to facilitate or
encourage, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in
any negotiations, inquiries or discussions with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) in connection with any such inquiries, proposals or offers,

information, (iv) enter into or execute, or propose to enter into or execute,
any agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (v) approve, endorse,
recommend or make or authorize any public statement, recommendation, or
solicitation in support of, or submit to the Company's stockholders, any
Acquisition Proposal, (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any
takeover statute inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing
described in clauses (i) through (vi). The Company and its Subsidiaries
will, and will cause their respective Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated all activities, discussions and negotiations that
commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, and shall terminate access to any virtual data room established by
the Company and request that all confidential or proprietary information
previously furnished to any party (other than Parent) in connection with any
such discussions and negotiations be promptly returned or destroyed. The
Company acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes any action that if taken by the
Company would be a breach of this _Section 7.3_, the taking of such action
by such Representative shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time, in the event that the Company receives an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 7.3_, the Company and its board of directors may (subject to
compliance with this _Section 7.3_) participate in discussions or
negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with,
or furnish any nonpublic information to, any Person or Persons (but only
after any such Person enters into a confidentiality agreement with the
Company containing terms that are not materially less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, which may not
provide for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not
restrict the Company from complying with this  _Section 7.3(b)_) making such
contact or making such Acquisition Proposal and their respective
Representatives and potential sources of financing, if prior to the
Acceptance Time (i) the Company's board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial

  



    

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Person or Persons have
submitted to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the Company's board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations,
furnish such information, enter into any agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal or accept any offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition
Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company's directors under applicable Law.

  



  

(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) (i) notify Parent of
the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) provide to
Parent a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (if written), or a summary of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (if oral),
including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, and
copies of all written communications with such Person with respect to
such actual or potential Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify
Parent, in writing, of any decision of its board of directors as to whether
to consider any Acquisition Proposal or to enter into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to provide non-public
information with respect to the Company to any Person, which notice shall be
given as promptly as practicable after such determination was reached (and in
any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after such determination was
reached). The Company will (i) provide Parent with written notice setting
forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed
in all material respects of the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal and of any material amendments thereto, (ii) keep Parent
informed as promptly as practicable with respect to any changes to the
material terms of an Acquisition Proposal submitted to the Company (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours following any such changes), including by
providing a copy of all written proposals and a summary of all oral proposals
or material oral modifications to an earlier written proposal, in each case
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) following the provision of any non-public information
of the Company to any such Person, provide such information to Parent
(including by posting such information to an electronic data room), to the
extent such information has not previously been provided or made available to
Parent, and (iv) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
such determination) notify Parent of any determination by the Company's board
of directors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(d) Subject to _Section 7.3(e)_ and _Section 7.3(f)_, neither the
board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly
or indirectly, (A) (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, adopt, or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) in the case
of any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to
recommend against such Acquisition Proposal, or fail to confirm the Board
Recommendation, within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) in the case of any publicly announced
Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to
issue a press release confirming the Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days following Parent's written request to the board of directors of
the Company that the board of directors of the Company issue such press
release (provided the board of directors shall not be required to issue more
than one such press release in response to any Acquisition Proposal), or

  



    

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) make any public statement that is inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation (it being understood that a statement to the effect that the
board of directors of the Company is considering an Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and its fiduciary duties
and confirming the Board Recommendation shall not be deemed to be inconsistent
with the Board Recommendation) (any action described in clause (i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (B)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow
the Company to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar agreement, arrangement, or understanding (i) constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) requiring it to abandon, terminate, or fail
to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company's board of directors may, if the Company's
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company's
directors under applicable Law, make a Change of Recommendation unrelated to
an Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any Change of
Recommendation proposed to be made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may
only be made pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.3(f)_) in
response to an Intervening Event; _provided_ , that:

  



  

(i) the Company has provided to Parent at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice that it intends to take such action, which notice
must specify the reasons for proposing to take such action, and include a
reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event; and

  



  

(ii) Parent shall not have made a proposal that, if accepted, would
be binding on Parent and that has not been withdrawn, within three
(3) Business Days (during which period the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith regarding any
proposal by Parent) after receipt of such notice from the Company, to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such manner
that would obviate the need for the Company's board of directors to effect
such Change of Recommendation.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company's board of directors may, if the Company's
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company's
directors under applicable Law, approve or recommend a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that:

  



  

(i) the Company has provided to Parent at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice that it intends to take such action, which notice
must specify the reasons for taking such action and, a written copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such potential
Superior Proposal, the

  



    

 | 61| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

identity of such party and a summary description of the material terms and
conditions of such potential Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(ii) Parent shall not have made a proposal that, if accepted, would
be binding on Parent and that has not been withdrawn, within three
(3) Business Days (during which period the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith regarding any
proposal by Parent) after receipt of such notice from the Company, to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event
of any revisions to the Superior Proposal (including any revision in the
amount, form or mix of consideration the Company's stockholders would receive
as a result of such potential Superior Proposal), the Company shall be
required to provide Parent with notice of such material amendment and there
shall be a new two (2) Business Day period following such notification during
which the Company shall negotiate with Parent and otherwise comply again with
the requirements of this _Section 7.3(f)_ and the board of directors of the
Company shall not make a Change of Recommendation prior to the end of any such
period as so extended.

  



  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors
of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such disclosure
referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) that relates to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless (x) the board of
directors of the Company expressly reaffirms the Board Recommendation in such
disclosure or (y) such disclosure is a "stop, look and listen" communication
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section
7.3(g)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company's board of directors to
make a Change of Recommendation or to take any of the actions referred to in
_Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_, except, in each case, to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 7.3(e)_ or _Section 7.3(f)_, as applicable.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) For the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
employed as of the Effective Time (the " _Employees_ "), for a period of 12
months following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, during an Employee's
period of employment or December 31, 2016), Parent agrees to provide or cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide (i) each
Employee with (x) a base salary or wage rate and (y) aggregate cash incentive
compensation opportunity that is no less favorable than the base salary or
wage rate and aggregate incentive compensation opportunity in effect for such
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (but without any requirement
to provide comparability for any equity or cash awards granted in
connection with or anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or with any change of control or retention features or as new hire
awards), and (ii) the

  



    

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Employees as a whole with employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable than those in effect for the Employees on the date
hereof (excluding any change in control or retention benefits, defined
benefit plans, and post-employment welfare benefits). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as (i) prohibiting
Parent from converting the employee benefits offered to the Employees at any
time during the aforementioned period to employee benefits offered by Parent
to comparably situated Parent employees, (ii) prohibiting the termination of
any employee benefits being offered to the Employees by the Company which are
not being offered by Parent to comparable situated Parent employees, or (iii)
conferring, or intending to confer, on any Employee a right to continued
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries. This _Section 7.4_ shall not apply with respect to
individuals covered by collective bargaining agreements or other collective
representations, in which case the terms of the applicable collective
bargaining agreement or collective representation shall apply, or (other
than with respect to equity-based incentive compensation) with respect to
individuals subject to non-United States law, in which case Parent agrees to
comply with any applicable laws or employment agreements with respect to
compensation and benefits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 7.4_, for not fewer than six months following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide U.S. Employees with severance benefits not less
favorable than those available to such U.S. Employees pursuant to the PMC-
Sierra U.S. Severance Guidelines.

  



  

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be
honored, in accordance with their terms, all material Benefit Plans
and material Foreign Benefit Plans.

  



  

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Employees
participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, service-based accrual rates of and entitlement to
benefits (including without limitation severance plans and arrangements),
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to
the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as
service with Parent and its Subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall
take commercially reasonable steps to waive eligibility waiting periods and
pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not included under
the corresponding Benefit Plan providing medical coverage, for purposes of
the first plan year ending after the Closing Date. Parent agrees to take
commercially reasonable steps to give or cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to give the Employees credit under the applicable
Parent Plan (in the first such Parent Plan year ending after the Effective
Time) for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Benefit Plan for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Parent Plan.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will in good
faith discuss the development of retention programs in connection with the
Employees continuing employment with the Surviving Corporation or Parent after
the Effective Time.

(e) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the scheduled expiration
of the Offer, Parent shall have received evidence that the Company has,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, terminated, if and to the extent
requested by Parent, the Benefit Plan intended to comply with Section 401(k)
of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and any other Benefit Plan or
other similar Contract maintained by the Company in each case as identified
on _Schedule 6.4(e)_ , in a form and on terms and timing reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (and, with respect to the Company 401(k) Plan, subject
to the occurrence of the Closing, prospectively effective no later than the
day before the scheduled expiration of the Offer).

  



  

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section 7.4_ with respect to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any direct or third party beneficiary right (i)
in any other Person, including employees, former employees, any participant or
any beneficiary thereof in any Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan or Parent
Plans, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 7.4_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or any other
employee benefit plans of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or Parent or
prohibits Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan.

  



  

(g) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into, adopts,
amends, modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such
amounts payable under such Company Arrangement shall (i) be paid or granted
as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed,
or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be
calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the
Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. Moreover, the Company shall
take all actions necessary so that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i) the
adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each such Company Arrangement
shall be approved as an employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the Company in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking
prior to the Expiration Date of all necessary actions by the board of
directors of the Company, the Company Compensation Committee or its
independent directors.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of
Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall
be approved by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any
other press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior review
and approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the
party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with
the other party before making any such public announcements; _provided_ , that
the Company will not be required to obtain the prior approval of or consult
with the other party in connection with

  



    

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

any such press release or public announcement if (a) the Company's board of
directors has effected a Change of Recommendation pursuant to _Section
7.3(e)_, (b) in connection with any such press release or public announcement
pursuant to _Section 7.3(f)_, or (c) such press release or public
announcement consists solely of information previously disclosed in all
material respects in a previously distributed press release or public
announcement.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance and
Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify
and hold harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors or officers of the Company or any of its present or former
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by Law and by the by-laws of
the Company or any applicable Subsidiary, and Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and the by-laws of the Company or any
applicable Subsidiary. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
fulfill and honor to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, all
rights to exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time existing as of the Effective Time in favor of
directors and officers of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
predecessors in their capacity as officers or directors, and the heirs,
executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or
director (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as provided in the Company's or each
of its Subsidiaries' respective certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or
comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement, shall
survive the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. After the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law. In addition, for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws (or other similar organizational documents) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by
applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of
the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of
the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the
Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the
" _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period
of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective

  



    

 | 65| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Company's existing policies;  _provided_ , that in no event shall the
Company pay, and in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay, an aggregate premium for any such insurance policy or
policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such coverage (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the annual premium of such policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. If the Company or
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
of this Agreement with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors' and
officers' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Company's existing policies, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the DandO Indemnitees who are insured under the
Company's DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current DandO
Insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the
Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ _further_
, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. _Section
7.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth in reasonable detail a
description of the Company's DandO Insurance existing as of the date hereof,
including the annual premium for such DandO Insurance.

  



  

(c) This  _Section 7.6_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified
Parties and the DandO Indemnitees, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party or DandO Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives.

  



  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.6_.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

parties hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and

applicable foreign Antitrust Laws (collectively, " _Foreign
Antitrust Approvals_ ") with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of any
applicable legal deadline ( _provided_ , that the submission or filing (i) of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act will be made within
ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) for applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws shall be submitted by the parties with the relevant
notification forms, or a draft thereof, for jurisdictions where submission of
a draft prior to formal notification is appropriate, within forty-five (45)
calendar days of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that, in
the case of clause (ii), if a party is not prepared to file any such
submission or filing within such period, such party's senior executives shall
discuss the reasons for the failure to meet such submission or filing
deadlines with the senior executives from the other party) and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any other filings required

the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or
litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other person
relating to the Offer or the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws, _provided_ that Parent shall consult with, and consider in
good faith the views of, the Company throughout the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including by providing the Company
with reasonable opportunity to evaluate, as promptly as practicable, steps to
be taken in pursuit of such defense. The Company shall not make any offer,
acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Governmental Entity with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling,
except as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide full and effective support of
Parent in all material respects in all such investigations, litigation,
negotiations and discussions to the extent requested by Parent. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties shall provide to the other parties in
advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
such Antitrust Laws. The parties hereto agree to (i) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings, (iii) to the extent practicable, give
each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws,
(iv) if any Governmental Entity initiates a substantive oral communication
regarding any Antitrust Laws, promptly notify the other party of the substance
of such communication, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon all written communications (including
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals) with a Governmental Entity regarding any Antitrust Laws, and (vi)
provide each other with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures or
provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel basis if appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, and without limiting Parent's right to direct the antitrust
defense of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent agrees, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, to use
reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals
required under or in

amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or the significant impediment of effective competition
(collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), to enable all waiting periods under
applicable Antitrust Laws to expire, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under applicable Antitrust Laws asserted by any Governmental
Entity, in each case, to cause the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby to occur prior to the Termination

other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), and (z) contesting, defending
and appealing any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or

connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement.

  



  

The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. The
Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other (on an outside counsel basis if appropriate) all information
required for any filing, submission, application or request to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Company agree that nothing
contained in this _Section 7.7(b)_ shall modify, limit or otherwise affect
their respective rights and responsibilities under _Section 7.7(a)_.

accordance with its terms and past practice, _provided_ , that if the Closing
is expected to occur prior to the end of an Offering Period (as defined in
the ESPP) (" _Offering Period_ "), the Company shall take action to provide
for an earlier Exercise Date (as defined in the ESPP) in accordance with
Section 19 of the ESPP. Such earlier Exercise Date (the " _New Exercise
Date_ ") shall be as reasonably close to the Closing Date as is
administratively practicable, and the Company shall notify each participant
in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the earlier Exercise Date that
the Exercise Date for his or her option (including for purposes of determining
the Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP) of such option) has been changed

automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date he or she

Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.9 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Expiration Date, the
board of directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of non-

guidance of the SEC so that the disposition of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options, Company Performance Restricted Stock Units and
Company Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or
director of the Company who is a covered person for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act. Prior to the Expiration Date, the board of directors of
Parent, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors, shall adopt
a resolution consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that
the acquisition of Parent Common Stock, Converted PRSUs and Converted RSUs
pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who may
become a covered person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall

Section 7.10 _Filing of Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable with respect to Converted PRSUs, Converted RSUs and
shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
the Converted PRSUs and Converted RSUs assumed in accordance with this
Agreement remain outstanding. Parent shall at

  



    

 | 69| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

times ensure that there will remain a sufficient amount of unissued shares of
Parent Common Stock to meet its share issuance obligations in connection with
the Company Performance Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Stock
Units. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to take any action
required to be taken by it under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the conversion of the conversion of the Company Restricted
Stock Units into Converted RSUs and the conversion of the Company Performance
Restricted Stock Units into Converted PRSUs, and the Company shall furnish to
Parent any information concerning the Company and holders of the
Company Restricted Stock Units and the Company Performance Restricted Stock
Units as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such
action. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issuable upon the vesting of the Company Restricted Stock
Units and the Company Performance Restricted Stock Units, to be approved for
listing on Nasdaq at or prior to the Acceptance Time.

promptly notify Parent in writing, and Parent shall promptly notify the
Company in writing, of: (a) any written communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) any written communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than such communications contemplated
by _Section 7.7_, which shall be governed by such Section) or (c) any
actions, claims, investigations, suits or proceedings commenced or, to the
Knowledge of the Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company) or Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent) that are related to the
Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any
transaction litigation brought by a stockholder of the Company or Parent, as
applicable). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence
of any event, which would be reasonably likely to cause (i) any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality to not be true and accurate in any respect as if
such representation or warranty were made at such time, or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified to not be true and
accurate in any material respect as if such representation were made at such
time, or (ii) the Company or Parent, as applicable, to fail to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , that no
such notification shall be deemed to cure any breach or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable
or proper to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms
thereof (including any "market flex" provisions) including using its
reasonable best efforts to seek to enforce its rights with respect to funding
under the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a breach thereof by the
financing provider(s) thereunder. Parent shall not, without the
Company's prior written consent, permit any amendment, supplement,
replacement or modification to be

  



    

 | 70| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter if
such amendment, supplement, replacement, modification or waiver (A)
subject to Parent's rights under _Section 7.12(b)_ which shall not require
the Company's consent, reduces the aggregate amount of the cash proceeds from
the Debt Financing or (B) imposes new or additional conditions to the initial
funding or otherwise expands any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt
Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of
the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
(x) delay or prevent the funding in full of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date, or
(y) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights with respect
to funding against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto ( _provided_ , that Parent may
amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities so long as such action
would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Acceptance Time or
the Closing). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement.

  



  

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
to, use its reasonable best efforts (A) to maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter ( _provided_ that the Debt Commitment Letter may be amended,
supplemented, replaced, modified or waived as provided in this _Section
7.12_), (B) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms
and conditions that are not materially less favorable to Parent than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (C) to satisfy on a timely basis (or
obtain the waiver of), and in a manner that will not impede the ability of
the parties to consummate the Offer or the Merger, all conditions to
receipt of the full amount of the Debt Financing at the Closing set forth
therein that are within its control or subject to its influence and, upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, (D) to comply with
its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, and (E) to consummate the
Debt Financing at or prior to the Effective Time. In the event that all
conditions precedent expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter have
been or, upon funding of the Debt Financing will be, satisfied, Parent and Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to enforce their rights with respect
to funding under, and cause the Financing Sources, lenders and the other
persons providing or committing to provide the Debt Financing to comply with
their obligations with respect to funding under the Debt Commitment Letter
and definitive financing agreements and to fund on or before the Effective
Time the Debt Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing, and, promptly following request by the Company, provide to
the Company copies of all executed Debt Financing Agreements.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the
Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any
time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is terminated
for any reason, (ii) Parent becomes aware of any breach or default (A) by any
Financing Source party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing
Agreement or (B) any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt
Financing Agreement if, in the case of this clause (B), such breach or
default would reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the Debt

the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms
set forth therein. Parent shall promptly provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstances referred to
in this _Section 7.12(c)_. Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any
action or enter into any transaction that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any portion of the
Debt Financing.

  



  

(d) Parent shall have the right to substitute the net cash proceeds
received by Parent after the date hereof and prior to the Closing
from consummated offerings or other incurrences of debt (including notes) by
Parent for all or any portion of the Debt Financing by reducing commitments
under the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_ that (v) such offering or other
incurrence of debt does not result in a breach or default under, or violation
of, the Debt Commitment Letter, (w) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing committed under the Debt Commitment Letter following such reduction,
together with other cash and cash equivalents available to Parent, is
sufficient to pay all cash amounts required to be paid in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (x) the proceeds of such debt
offerings or other incurrences have been received by Parent in cash, (y)
Parent promptly notifies the Company of such substitution and reduction and
(z) true, correct and complete copies of each material amendment or
modification to the Debt Commitment Letter relating thereto will be promptly
provided to the Company. If commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter
have been reduced to zero in connection with the preceding sentence, the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to _Section 7.13_
shall no longer be in effect. Further, Parent shall have the right to
substitute commitments in respect of other financings for all or any portion
of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources so
long as the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, together with other cash
and cash equivalents available to Parent, is sufficient to pay all cash
amounts required to be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and all conditions precedent to funding of such financing
are, in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent to (or more favorable to
the Company than) the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, to supplement or replace the Debt Financing (" _Alternative Debt
Financing_ "). True, correct and complete copies of each alternative
financing commitment in respect of such Alternative Debt Financing (each, a "
_New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), together with all related fee letters and
associated engagement letters (solely in the case of the fee letter, with only
the fee amounts, pricing, "market flex" provisions and other economic terms
that do not adversely affect the enforceability, availability or
conditionality of, or the aggregate amount of proceeds available under, the
Debt Financing contained therein redacted), will be promptly provided to the
Company. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter
which is not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in
question and each New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect,
and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be deemed to
include any fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that is not
superseded by any New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and each
fee letter relating to each New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in
effect.

the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

relationships, (vii) using commercially reasonable efforts in assisting Parent
in its efforts to obtain corporate credit or family ratings of Parent to the

intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely
affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or
permit the taking of any action to the extent it would (1) interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (2) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates to pay (or agree to pay) any fees, or reimburse
any expenses prior to the Closing for which it is not promptly reimbursed, or

any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers
shall be obligated to adopt resolutions or execute consents to approve or
authorize the execution of the Debt Financing; _provided_ that this clause (y)
shall not prohibit the adoption or execution of any resolutions or consents
effective no earlier than the Closing Date by any persons that shall remain or
will become officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time; and (z) any documentation executed by the Company
of any of its Subsidiaries shall not become effective until the Effective
Time. Parent shall (1) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorney's fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, as applicable, in
connection with the Debt Financing and providing the assistance contemplated
by this _Section 7.13_ and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives (collectively,

judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the Debt Financing and any information used in connection therewith or

Cooperation Indemnity_ "). The Financing Cooperation Indemnity shall survive
the consummation of the Merger and any termination of this Agreement.

(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), or (ii)
that would result in the payment by Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof of any amount in excess of the retention or deductible under any
applicable insurance policy of the Company. Subject to applicable Law, other
than with respect to any litigation where the Company is adverse to Parent,
Parent will give the Company the reasonable opportunity, at the
Company's sole cost and expense, to participate, subject to a customary joint

hereby. Prior to the consummation of the Merger, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Parent shall not settle any action, claim, suit or
proceeding related to the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby unless such settlement provides a full and

where the failure to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality", "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or similar
qualifications as set forth therein) would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (assuming that the date
of such determination is the Closing Date) if Parent or Sub shall not have
performed in all material respects all of the respective obligations hereunder
required to be performed by Parent or Sub, as the case may be, at or prior to
the Closing; _provided_ , that if such breach is reasonably capable of being
cured by Parent and Sub through the exercise of their reasonable best efforts
within the earlier of (A) the forty-five (45) day period
following notification by the Company to Parent of such breach or inaccuracy

and in each case Parent and Sub continue to exercise such reasonable best
efforts, the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.1(c)(i)_ prior to the expiration of such period; _provided_ _further_ that

(i) upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be untrue,
in any case such that the events set forth in clauses (v)(c) or (v)(d) of
_Annex A_ shall have occurred; _provided_ , that if such breach is reasonably
capable of being cured by the Company through the exercise of its reasonable
best efforts during the forty-five (45) day period following notification by
Parent to the Company of such breach or inaccuracy and the Company continues

warranties of Parent and the Sub (assuming that the date of such
determination is the Closing Date) (x) set forth in _Section 6.3_ shall not
be true and correct except for inaccuracies that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in more

respects only as of such particular date or with respect to such specific
period), or (z) set forth in this Agreement, other than those Sections
specifically identified in clauses (x) or (y)of this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_,

case of this clause (z), where the failure to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality", "Parent

(A) if a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred or been
otherwise publicly disclosed, or (B) the Company shall have committed a
Knowing and Intentional Breach of its obligations under _Section 7.3_.

specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made
(other than in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_), and
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and there shall be no
damages or liability on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, Representatives,
agents or advisors other than, with respect to Parent, Sub and the Company,
the obligations pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section
9.2_, and _Article X_. Nothing contained in this _Section 9.2_ shall
relieve Parent, Sub or the Company from liability for fraud or a Knowing and
Intentional Breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) If, but only if,

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_, or

  



  

(ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ as a result of the failure to satisfy the
Minimum Condition prior to such termination, (B) there has been received after
the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn or publicly disclosed prior to
the termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal and (C) within
twelve (12) months after such termination, either (1) the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Qualifying Transaction, which is
subsequently consummated, or (2) a Qualifying Transaction is consummated,

  



  

then the Company shall (x) pay to Parent a termination fee of eighty-eight
million five hundred thousand dollars ($88,500,000) and (y) reimburse Parent
for its payment to the Company of the Skyworks Termination Fee (the " _Parent
Reimbursement Fee_ "), in each case, in cash,

  



  

(iii) concurrently with any termination pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(ii)_;

  



  

(iv) within three (3) Business Days following any termination pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_; and

  



  

(v) within three (3) Business Days after the consummation of a

circumstances set forth in _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_;

  



  

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
fee referred to in this _Section 9.2(b)_ on more than one occasion.
Upon payment of such fee, the Company shall have no further liability to
Parent or Sub with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, _provided_ , that nothing herein shall release any party from
liability for fraud or a Knowing and Intentional Breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(i)_ and it shall be judicially determined that this termination has
been caused by a Knowing and Intentional Breach by the Company, the Company

and (ii) reimburse Parent and Sub and their respective affiliates for all out-
of-pocket expenses and fees (including fees and expenses payable

contemplated by this Agreement or structuring the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, experts and consultants to Parent or Sub, and all printing and

exceed Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (all the foregoing being
referred to herein collectively as the " _Expenses_ "). The Expenses shall be
paid promptly following submission of statements therefor to an account
designated by Parent. Such payment shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, all rights and remedies Parent and Sub may have in such circumstances
under this Agreement. 

  



  

(d) All payments contemplated by this _Section 9.2_ shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes. If the Company fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, or any portion
thereof, (i) such amount or portion shall accrue interest from the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment at the Prime Rate
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus five percent
(5%) and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent or Sub its out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with any suit that
results in a judgment against the Company in respect of the amount set forth

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably
submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any United

any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery and

 | 84| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

as are necessary on its part to consummate the Offer and the Merger, will
cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching parties, for which damages,
even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party
hereby consents to the granting of injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction to prevent breaches of this Agreement, to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and to compel performance of
such party's obligations (including the taking of such actions as are required
of such party to consummate the Offer and the Merger), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which any party is entitled under this Agreement. The
parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with any such remedy, and that such remedy shall be in
addition to any other remedy to which a party is entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Company Related Party (other than Parent and Sub) shall have any rights or
claims against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no
Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any Company Related
Party (other than Parent or Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that, following the

parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that the Parent and/or Sub
may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent without the consent of the Company; _provided_  that Parent and/or

this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any assignment in
violation of this _Section 10.12_ shall be null and void.

entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the

SOURCE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE DEBT
FINANCING AND ANY RELATED COMMITMENT LETTER OR FEE LETTER RELATED THERETO) OR
THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER

that the Minimum Condition may not be waived, in each case, subject to the
terms of the Agreement and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure
by Parent or Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed
a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

  



  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is attached.
