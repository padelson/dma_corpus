and its Subsidiaries' licenses under the Licensed Intellectual Property
Rights, in each case, free and clear of any Lien. In each case where any
Registered Intellectual Property Right is held by assignment, the assignment

actions necessary to maintain and protect the Registered Intellectual

code for such Company Software owned or developed by or for the Company or
its Subsidiaries

 



 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26

Standards ("PCI DSS") as applicable and as in effect from time to time and
(c) all rules, policies and procedures established by the Company or any of

Subsidiaries (and to the knowledge of Sellers, no such claims are likely to
be asserted or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
alleging a violation of any Person's privacy, personal or confidentiality
rights under any such Applicable Law, the PCI DSS or the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' rules, policies or procedures, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not breach or otherwise
cause any violation of the foregoing. With respect to any personal and user

and monitoring compliance with adequate measures with respect to technical

misuse. To the knowledge of Sellers, there has been no unauthorized access to
or other misuse of that information.

and true and complete copies of, all insurance policies and fidelity bonds
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the assets,

Subsidiaries. There is no claim by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending under any such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been
questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds
or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved their rights. All
premiums payable under all such policies and bonds have been timely paid, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries have otherwise complied fully with the terms
and

 



 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27

issued by a Governmental Authority) required by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to conduct their business as presently conducted (the
"Permits"), together with the name of the Governmental Authority issuing such
Permit. The Permits are valid and in full force and effect, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under, and no condition

other Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or is to be a party, or to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

 



 

Section 4.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and

Section 4.04. Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by

which the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of
any Contract binding upon the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, except for
any defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations of any rights or
obligations, or loss of benefits that would not, individually or in the

Buyer's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Seller Notes and each other Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer
is or is to be a party, or to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder.

given or made by a Seller hereunder.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Restructuring

satisfied; and

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43

exercise any of its rights, powers, privileges, remedies or claims under, any
Restructuring Document (including any exhibit, schedule, or other attachment
thereto and any agreement to be entered into in connection therewith).

in confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect
to such information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality of
their own similar information. If this Agreement is terminated, (x) Buyer and
its Affiliates will, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, advisors and agents and their lenders and such other Persons to,

COVENANTS OF BUYER AND SELLERS

 



 

Buyer and Sellers agree that:

 



 

Section 7.01. Best Efforts; Further Assurances. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers will use their best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken (including by causing any Affiliates to take

desirable under Applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated

termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable.

 



 

Section 7.02. Certain Filings. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Material

contemplated by this Agreement or the Restructuring Transactions and (b) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the

contemplated hereby or the Restructuring Transactions.

 



 

Section 7.04. Certain Accounts. All of the accounts set forth in Section

Tax) shall be paid by Sellers when due, and each Seller will, at his or her
own expense,

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

file all necessary Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes and fees, and, if required by Applicable Law, Buyer will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and
other documentation.

 



 

(b) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, none of Sellers, the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries and any Affiliate of a Seller shall to the extent it
may affect or relate to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, do any of the
following things if doing so would have the effect of increasing the Tax
liability or reducing any Tax Asset of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer: make or change any Tax election, change any
annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting,
file any amended return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax
claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, offset or
other reduction in Tax liability, or consent to any extension or waiver of
the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax returns for the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for all tax
periods that are filed after the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit Sellers to
review and comment on each such Tax return that includes any Pre-Closing Tax
Period prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax returns as
are reasonably requested by Sellers. All Tax returns that include any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with all prior
Tax returns of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the extent
allowable by Applicable Law. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the day of filing of any such Tax return, the Company shall submit to Sellers
a statement of the amount, if any, shown as due on such Tax return that
constitutes Excluded Liabilities, and Sellers shall promptly remit such
amount to the Company (without duplication of amounts taken into account in
determining payments under Section 2.04), and the Company shall timely pay
all Taxes reported on such Tax return.

 



 

(d) Buyer and Sellers shall provide to the other such cooperation and
information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
the filing of any Tax return, amended Tax return or claim for refund,
determining liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, or in
conducting any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.

 



 

(e) Tax Audits. (i) Sellers shall have the sole right to represent the
interests of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or
suit, claim, litigation, proceeding (administrative, judicial, or in
arbitration, mediation or alternative dispute resolution), Governmental
Authority or grand jury investigation, or other action (any of the foregoing,
an "Action") relating to Shareholder Taxes and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense; provided,

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

however, that if the results of such Tax audit or proceeding could reasonably
be expected to have an adverse effect on the Buyer or its liabilities or
obligations under this Agreement, then there shall be no settlement or
closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the written consent
of the Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Buyer
agrees that it will cooperate fully, and will cause the Company to cooperate
fully, with Sellers and their counsel in the defense against or compromise of
any claim in any such proceeding. Buyer shall have the right to participate
in any such proceeding and to be represented by counsel of its own selection
in connection with such action and to be kept informed by the Sellers as to
the status of the action, all at Buyer's expense. Sellers shall keep Buyer
informed as to the status of any Action arising under this Section 7.05.

 



 

(ii) If any Governmental Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or
otherwise disputes or affects any Tax relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
promptly upon receipt by Buyer or the Company inform the Sellers thereof. The
failure of Buyer or the Company to timely forward such notification in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence shall not relieve the
Sellers of their obligations under this Agreement for Taxes except and to the
extent that the failure timely to forward such notification actually
increases the amount of such Taxes.

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall represent the interests of the Company in any Action
relating to Ordinary Course Taxes and all Tax returns filed or required to be
filed for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Post-Closing Tax
Periods, including any period that begins before and end after the Closing
Date; provided, however, that if the results of such Action could reasonably
be expected to have an adverse effect on the Sellers or their liabilities or
obligations under this Agreement, then there shall be no settlement or
closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the written consent
of the Sellers (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The
Sellers and Buyer agree that they will cooperate fully with each other party
and its respective counsel in the defense against or compromise of any claim
in any such proceeding. The Sellers shall have the right, at Sellers'
expense, to participate in any such proceeding and to be represented by
counsel of its own selection in connection with any such action in which
Buyer represents the interests of the Company. Buyer shall keep
Sellers informed as to the status of any Action arising under this
Section 7.05.

 



 

(iv) Any dispute as to any matter covered in this Section 7.05 shall be
resolved by the Accounting Referee. The fees and expenses of such accounting
firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers and Buyer.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(f) Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements or Tax distribution
agreements shall be terminated as of the date hereof (other than agreements
among only the Company and its Subsidiaries). After the date hereof, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further rights or
liabilities thereunder. This Agreement shall be the sole Tax sharing
agreement or Tax distribution agreement relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) Neither Buyer, the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall make any
election under Section 338 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local, or foreign income Tax law) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(h) Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Taxes to which Buyer or the
Company and its Subsidiaries become entitled, that relate to Excluded
Liabilities or Shareholder Taxes shall be for the account of Sellers, and
Buyer shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such
credit within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

 



 

(i) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation and filing
of any Tax return, statement, report or form (including any report required
pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder), any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other party's request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

(j) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use all reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated

Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise

breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given
to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time.

 



 

Section 9.02. Indemnification. (a) Effective at and after the Closing,
Sellers hereby jointly and severally indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates and
their respective successors and assignees and, effective at the Closing,
without duplication, the Company, each of its Subsidiaries and their
respective successors and assignees against and agree to hold each of them
harmless from any and all damage, loss, liability and expense (including
reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (including any Tax
audit) whether involving a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") or a
claim solely among the parties hereto) ("Damages"), incurred or suffered by
Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors and assignees, whether in connection with a Third
Party Claim or otherwise, arising out of (without duplication):

 



 

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty (determined, except in the
case of Section 3.09, without regard to any qualification or exception
contained therein relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or any
similar qualification or standard) by a Seller in this Agreement or by a
Seller Entity in any Ancillary Agreement to which such Seller Entity is or is
to be a party or in any certificate or other writing delivered by a Seller
Entity pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
(each such misrepresentation and breach of warranty, a "Warranty Breach");

 



 

(ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by a Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or by a Seller Entity pursuant to any Ancillary
Agreement to which such Seller Entity is or is to be a party (each such
breach, a "Covenant Breach");

 



 

(iii) any Transaction Expenses that are not included in the Transaction
Expenses Amount set forth in the Closing Statement; or

 



 

 

(iv) any Excluded Liabilities;

 

 



 

provided that (A) with respect to indemnification by Sellers for Warranty
Breaches pursuant to clause (i) above (other than breaches of any Specified
Representation or Section 3.24 (any such breach, an "Excluded Warranty

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Breach")), (x) Sellers shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of
Damages with respect to such Warranty Breaches exceeds $5 million (the
"Threshold Amount") (in which case Sellers shall be liable for all such
Damages without regard to the Threshold Amount) and (y) Sellers' maximum
liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $310 million (the
"Cap") and (B) with respect to indemnification by Sellers for Ordinary Course
Taxes and any Indemnified Escheat Payment, Sellers shall not be liable unless
the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such amounts exceeds $300,000
(in which case Sellers shall be liable for all such Damages without regard to
such threshold amount). For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on
indemnification set forth in the foregoing proviso shall not apply to any
indemnification by Sellers for (1) Excluded Warranty Breaches, (2) Covenant
Breaches or (3) Excluded Liabilities (except, in the case of Ordinary Course
Taxes and any Indemnified Escheat Payment subject to the threshold described
in clause (B), to the extent of such threshold), and the amount of any
Damages with respect to Excluded Warranty Breaches, Covenant Breaches and
Excluded Liabilities shall not be included in the calculation of either the
Threshold Amount or the Cap.

 



 

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies each Seller,
his or her heirs and legal representatives, his or her Affiliates and their
respective successors and assignees against and agrees to hold each of them
harmless from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by such Seller, his or
her heirs and legal representatives, any of his or her Affiliates or any of
their respective successors and assignees, whether in connection with a Third
Party Claim or otherwise, arising out of any (i) misrepresentation or breach
of warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, the Seller Notes or any
other Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or is to be a party or in any
certificate or other writing delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto or thereto or
in connection herewith or therewith (each such misrepresentation and breach
of warranty, a "Buyer Warranty Breach"), or (ii) breach of covenant or
agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, the
Seller Notes, or any other Ancillary Agreement to which Buyer is or is to be
a party (each such breach, a "Buyer Covenant Breach"); provided that with
respect to indemnification by Buyer for Buyer Warranty Breaches pursuant to
this Section 9.02 (other than breaches of the representations and warranties
in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04(i) and (ii) and 4.08), (x) Buyer shall not
be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such
Warranty Breaches exceeds the Threshold Amount (in which case Buyer shall be
liable for all such Damages without regard to the Threshold Amount) and (y)
Buyer's maximum liability for all such Buyer Warranty Breaches shall not
exceed the Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations on
indemnification set forth in the foregoing proviso shall not apply to any
indemnification by Buyer for Buyer Covenant Breaches, and the amount of any
Damages with respect to Buyer Covenant Breaches shall not be included in the
calculation of either the Threshold Amount or the Cap.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 9.03. Third Party Claim Procedures. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 9.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give
prompt notice to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of
any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such
Section. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent
such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 9.03, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense; provided that prior to assuming
control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must acknowledge that it
would have an indemnity obligation for the Damages resulting from such
Third Party Claim as provided under this Article 9.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain
control of the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) the Indemnifying
Party does not deliver the acknowledgment referred to in Section 9.03(b)
within 30 days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim pursuant to
Section 9.03(a), (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (iii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse
determination with respect to the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to
the reputation or future business prospects of the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates, (iv) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or
(v) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend
vigorously the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.03, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement of such Third Party Claim,
unless such settlement (i) is limited solely to the payment of cash and (ii)
provides for the full, complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party and its Affiliates.

 



 

(e) In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose, in which case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall
be borne by the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Indemnified Party, provided that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) incurred by the
Indemnified Party prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
the defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) if representation of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create
a conflict of interest.

 



 

(f) Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to
be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(g) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense, the
Indemnified Party may pay, compromise or contest the Third Party Claim at
issue. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof; provided that such
Third Party Claim is subject to indemnification under Section 9.02. Whether
or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party
Claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this Section 9.03 shall not be applicable to any Action
under Section 7.05(e), which Action shall be subject to the procedures set
forth in Section 7.05(e).

 



 

Section 9.04. Direct Claim Procedures. In the event the Indemnified Party
should have a claim for indemnity under Section 9.02 against the Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
give prompt notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. The failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have
materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days
following the receipt of a notice with respect to any such claim that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity obligation to the Indemnified Party
for any Damages with respect to such claim, such Damages shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnified Party the
amount thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its indemnity
obligation for any Damages with respect to such claim, the parties shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation
in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 11.08.

 



 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Section 9.05. Calculation of Damages. The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 9.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall (i) be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for such Damages,
(ii) be reduced by any tax benefit actually realized or other reduction of
the tax liability of the Indemnified Party as a result of the facts and
circumstances giving rise to any Damages hereunder and (iii) not include any
indirect, special, consequential or punitive Damages or Damages for lost
profits, except in the case of Third Party Claims. If the Indemnified Party
receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages or obtains any tax benefit
referred to in Section 9.05(ii), in each case, subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount.

 



 

Section 9.06. Recourse Against Seller Notes. (a) Subject to the limitations
on Sellers' obligations set forth in this Article 9 and the procedures set
forth in Section 9.06(b) and Section 9.06(c) below, any claim by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates against Sellers for Damages payable under this Article 9
may, at Buyer's option, be satisfied by setting off any amounts owed by Buyer
under the Seller Notes (in which case the principal amount of the Seller
Notes shall be reduced by the amount of such Damages, and from and after the
date of the applicable Set-Off Notice no interest would be payable on such
amount).

 



 

(b) Prior to any set-off pursuant to this Section 9.06, Buyer shall send a
notice (a "Set-Off Notice") to the Seller Representative setting forth the
amount of Damages to be set off and applied against the Seller Notes (the
"Set-Off Amount"), together with calculations supporting the computation of
the Set-Off Amount. Seller Representative may, within 30 days after receipt
of any Set-Off Notice, deliver to Buyer a written notice of objection to such
set-off. Buyer shall be permitted to set off and apply the Set-Off Amount set
forth in such Set-Off Notice against the Seller Notes upon the earliest to
occur of (i) the mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller Representative with
respect to the Set-Off Amount, (ii) the failure of Seller Representative to
deliver to Buyer a notice of objection within 30 days after Seller
Representative's receipt of the Set-Off Notice and (iii) the entry of a
final, nonappealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction that Sellers
are liable for the payment of such Damages set forth in the Set-Off Notice
pursuant to this Agreement (in which case the Set-Off Amount shall be
the amount awarded to Buyer or its Affiliates by such court).

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(c) If Buyer delivers a notice of objection with respect to any Set-Off
Notice pursuant to Section 9.06(b), then during the period beginning on the
date of the Set-Off Notice and ending on the date that Buyer becomes entitled
to set off the applicable Set-Off Amount pursuant to Section 9.06(b)(i) or
(iii) above, Buyer shall not be required to pay interest on such Set-Off
Amount under the Seller Notes, and if any principal amount comes due under
the Seller Notes during such period, Buyer may withhold an amount of
principal equal to such Set-Off Amount and with respect to such withheld
principal amount the Maturity Date (as defined in the Seller Notes) shall be
extended until the Final Determination Date. Interest and principal withheld
by Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.06(c) shall not be payable under the
Seller Notes until the earlier to occur of (i) the mutual agreement of Buyer
and Seller Representative regarding the treatment of such interest and
principal and (ii) the entry of a final, nonappealable order by a court of
competent jurisdiction that Sellers are not liable for the payment of Damages
pursuant to this Agreement (or that Sellers are liable for the payment of
Damages pursuant to this Agreement in an amount that is less than the amount
of the interest and principal so withheld, in which case Buyer shall promptly
remit to Sellers any such amounts that are not set off and applied against
the Seller Notes pursuant to Section 9.06(b)(iii) above) (the "Final
Determination Date").

 



 

(d) Any Set-Off Amount set off by Buyer pursuant to this Section 9.06 shall
be applied in the following priority:

 



 

(i) first, against the Seller Note in the original principal amount of
$150,000,000 and with a tenor of five years after the Closing Date, until the
outstanding principal amount under such Seller Note (after giving effect to
all payments on such Seller Note and set-offs pursuant to this Section 9.06)
has been reduced to zero; and

 



 

(ii) thereafter, against the Seller Note in the original principal amount of
$100,000,000 and with a maturity date of December 15, 2010.

 



 

Section 9.07. Remedies Exclusive. From and after the Closing, absent fraud
or intentional misconduct, Article 9 shall provide the sole and exclusive
remedy (x) in the case of Buyer, for any Warranty Breaches or Covenant
Breaches, and (y) in the case of Sellers, for any Buyer Warranty Breaches or
Buyer Covenant Breaches.

60

(b) by Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if the Closing
shall not have been consummated on or before November 15, 2009; provided that
such date shall be automatically extended (but in no event beyond December

under the Commitment Letter is extended to a later date; and provided,
further that the party electing to terminate this Agreement is not in
material breach of this Agreement at the time of such termination; or

 



 

(c) by Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or the Restructuring Transactions

permitted by Section 10.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,

Agreement; provided that if such termination shall result from the (i)
willful failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of
the obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of
this Agreement or (iii) breach by either party hereto of any representation
or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable
for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result
of such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 6.01, 11.07, 11.08 and

the subordination provisions contained in Section 4), the Issuer may, at any
time prior to the Maturity Date and so long as such prepayment is not

        |  

  (i)

4.   Subordination Provisions.

 

 

 

(a) Subordination. Payment of this Note (including, without limitation, under
Section 2 or Section 8 hereof) is and shall be expressly subordinate and
junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Senior
Obligations to the extent and in the manner set forth herein, and this Note
is hereby so subordinated as a claim against the Issuer or any of the assets
of the Issuer, whether such claim be made (i) in the event of any Insolvency
Proceeding, or (ii) other than in connection with an Insolvency Proceeding,
prior to the Senior Obligations being Paid in Full.

without limitation, under Section 2 or Section 8 hereto) in violation of the
terms hereof, it shall hold such payment in trust for the benefit of the
Senior Creditors and forthwith pay it over to the Senior Debt Agent, for
application in accordance with the Senior Debt Documents. In the event that
any payment hereunder shall be due and, at such time, the Issuer shall be
prohibited by the terms of this Note from making such payment to the
Noteholder, the Issuer shall instead, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, make such payment to the Senior Debt Agent to the extent the Senior Debt
Obligations have not been Paid In Full.

 

 

(c) Insolvency Proceedings; Acceleration of Senior Obligations.  (i) In the
event of any Insolvency Proceeding relative to the Issuer or any Guarantor or
its properties or any acceleration of any Senior Obligations, then all of the
Senior Obligations shall first be Paid in Full before the Noteholder may
receive and retain any payment upon this Note, and in any such proceedings
any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash or
property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of
this Note shall be paid or delivered directly to the Senior Debt Agent to the
extent of any unpaid Senior Obligations, unless and until all such Senior
Obligations are Paid in Full, and the Noteholder hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Senior Debt Agent, as attorney-in-fact for such
Noteholder, to prove any claim in such proceedings on this Note, and to
demand, sue for, collect and receive any such payment or distribution, and to
apply such payment or distribution to the payment of the then unpaid Senior
Obligations, and to take such other action (including acceptance or rejection
of any plan of reorganization in any Insolvency Proceeding) in the name of
such Noteholder or of the relevant Senior Creditors as the Senior Debt Agent
may deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of the provisions hereof.
The Noteholder shall execute and deliver such other and further powers of
attorney, assignments, proofs of claim or other instruments as may be
requested by the Senior Debt Agent in order to accomplish the foregoing, but
only with respect to such Noteholder's capacity as a Noteholder hereunder and
not in respect of any other relationship between such Noteholder and the
Issuer.

 

 

(ii) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any such
Insolvency Proceeding, any payment or distribution of the assets of the
Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities,
shall be received by the Noteholder in respect of this Note before all Senior
Obligations are Paid in Full, such payment or distribution shall be held in
trust for the Senior Creditors and shall forthwith be paid over to the Senior
Debt Agent to the extent any Senior Obligations have not been Paid in Full
after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the Senior
Debt Agent.

 

 

(iii) In the event of any Insolvency Proceeding against the Issuer or any
Guarantor or any of their assets, the Noteholder hereby agrees not to contest
and hereby waives any right to object to and expressly consents to (A) any
post-petition financing of or use of cash collateral by Issuer or any
Guarantor, to the extent approved or provided by the Senior Debt Agent, and
the granting by Issuer or any Guarantor to Senior Debt Agent of senior liens
and priorities in connection therewith and (B) any sale or other disposition
of any property securing all of any part of the Senior Obligations free and
clear of security interests, liens or other claims of Noteholder under
Section 363 of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code if the Senior
Debt Agent has approved or consented to such sale or disposition.

 

 

(d) Standstill; Certain Other Agreements. (i) The Noteholder agrees that,
until the earlier to occur of the Maturity Date or the date the Senior
Obligations are Paid in Full (A) if a payment default shall have occurred and
be continuing with respect to any Senior Obligations or a Payment Blockage
Period shall have occurred and be continuing or if an Insolvency Proceeding
shall have commenced, it will not take, demand or receive, or take any action
to accelerate or collect, any payment of all or any part of this Note and (B)
it will not file, join in or facilitate any petition or proceeding seeking
the involuntary bankruptcy of the Issuer or any Guarantor.

 

 

(ii)   The Noteholder further agrees (A) that it shall not request, seek,
obtain or maintain any lien on or security interest in any property, tangible
or intangible, of the Issuer or any Guarantor as security for payment of the
obligation under this Note and that it shall not attach or levy or take any
action against any property, tangible or intangible, of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under any circumstances and (B) that it shall not take, nor consent
to or acquiesce in the taking of, any action to set aside, challenge or
otherwise dispute the existence, validity or priority of the
Senior Obligations or the creation, attachment, validity, perfection,
priority or continuation of any lien or security interest of the Senior Debt
Agent or the Senior Creditors in any property, tangible or intangible, of the
Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries.

 

 

(iii)   The Senior Creditors, or any of them, may, at any time and from time
to time, without the consent of or notice to the Noteholder, without
incurring any responsibility to the Noteholder, and without impairing or
releasing any of the rights of any of the Senior Creditors, or any of the

(ii)   The Issuer hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand, protest and

payable, without notice of default, presentment or demand for payment,
protest or notice of nonpayment or dishonor, or other notices or demands of

outstanding hereunder, including

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13

without notice of default, presentment or demand for payment, protest or
notice of nonpayment or dishonor, or other notices or demands of any kind or

8.  Guaranty.

 

 

 

(a) Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a
guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity,
by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all
times thereafter, of any and all existing and future indebtedness and
liabilities of every kind, nature and character, direct or indirect, absolute
or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, voluntary or involuntary and
whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs,
expenses or otherwise, of the Issuer to the Noteholder under this Note
(including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other
modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by
the Noteholder in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof), and
whether recovery upon such indebtedness and liabilities may be or hereafter
become unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any
proceeding or case commenced by or against any Guarantor or the Issuer under
any Debtor Relief Law, and including interest that accrues after the
commencement by or against the Issuer of any proceeding under any Debtor
Relief Laws (such obligations, the "Guaranteed Obligations" and such
guaranty, the "Guaranty"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of
each Guarantor with respect to its Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to
an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its
obligations under the Guaranty subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of any state law. This Guaranty
shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement
evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence,
validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any
collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the
Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the
obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any
way relating to any or all of the foregoing.

 

 

(b) Rights of Noteholder. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Note. Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Noteholder may, at any
time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting
the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (i) amend, extend,
renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for
payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (ii)
take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or
otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any
Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) apply such security and direct the order or
manner of sale thereof as the Noteholder in its sole discretion may
determine; and (iv) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or
other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or
failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary
the risks of such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate
as a discharge of such Guarantor.

 

 

(c) Certain Waivers. Each Guarantor waives (i) any defense arising by reason
of any disability or other defense of the Issuer or any other guarantor, or
the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of
the Noteholder) of the liability of the Issuer; (ii) any defense based on any
claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than
those of the Issuer; (iii) the benefit of any statute of limitations
affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder; (iv) any right to require the
Noteholder to proceed against the Issuer, proceed against or exhaust any
security for the Indebtedness, or pursue any other remedy in the Noteholder's
power whatsoever; (v) any benefit of and any right to participate in any
security now or hereafter held by the Noteholder; and (vi) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be
derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or
exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives all
setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or
performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of
protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or
nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices
of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of
new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.

 

 

(d) Subrogation. Each Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation,
contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any
payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and
performed in full. If any amounts are paid to such Guarantor in violation of
the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Noteholder and shall forthwith be paid to the Noteholder to
reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured.

 

 

(e) Termination; Reinstatement. (i) This Guaranty is a continuing and
irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing
and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations
and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in
full in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in
full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or
on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor is made, or the Noteholder exercises
its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such
payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Noteholder in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, all
as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and
whether or not the Noteholder is in possession of or has released this
Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination
or reduction. The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall
survive termination of this Guaranty.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 8(e)(i) above, if any Guarantor ceases to be a
co-borrower or a guarantor of the obligations under the Credit Agreement
pursuant to the terms

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereof, such Guarantor shall be automatically released from its Guaranty
without any further action from the Noteholder.

 

 

(f) Additional Guarantors. To the extent that any Subsidiary shall become a
co-borrower or a guarantor of the obligations under the Credit Agreement
pursuant to the terms thereof, the Issuer will cause concurrently such
Subsidiary to execute a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Noteholder, whereupon such Subsidiary shall become a
"Guarantor" as defined herein.

 

 

9.   Set-Off. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree that any Set-Off Amount (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) shall be applied to reduce this Note or the Junior Subordinated Seller Note in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.06(d) of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 

 

10. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Note shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor may assign its rights and obligations under this Note other than pursuant to a Permitted Merger. The Noteholder may at any time assign its rights and obligations under this Note (which assignment shall be in respect of not less than all of its obligations hereunder) to any other Person with the consent of the Issuer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that the Issuer shall have been offered the right of first refusal with respect to such assignment (other than any assignment as collateral security for Indebtedness) for a period of 30 days and the Issuer shall have elected not to exercise such right upon the earlier to occur of such election or the expiry of such 30 day period, and provided further that, in no event shall the Issuer be required to consent to a potential assignee that has been determined by the majority of the directors of the board of directors unaffiliated with the Noteholder to be an "Adverse Person".

(a) Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally
guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a
guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity,
by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all
times thereafter, of any and all existing and future indebtedness and
liabilities of every kind, nature and character, direct or indirect, absolute
or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, voluntary or involuntary and
whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs,
expenses or otherwise, of the Issuer to the Noteholder under this Note
(including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other
modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by
the Noteholder in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof), and
whether recovery upon such indebtedness and liabilities may be or hereafter
become unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any
proceeding or case commenced by or against any Guarantor or the Issuer under
any Debtor Relief Law, and including interest that accrues after the
commencement by or against the Issuer of any proceeding under any Debtor
Relief Laws (such obligations, the "Guaranteed Obligations" and such
guaranty, the "Guaranty"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of
each Guarantor with respect to its Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to
an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its
obligations under the Guaranty subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of any state law. This Guaranty
shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement
evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence,
validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any
collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the
Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the
obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any
way relating to any or all of the foregoing.

 

 

(b) Rights of Noteholder. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Note. Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Noteholder may, at any
time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting
the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (i) amend, extend,
renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for
payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (ii)
take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or
otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any
Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) apply such security and direct the order or
manner of sale thereof as the Noteholder in its sole discretion may
determine; and (iv) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or
other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or
failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary
the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this
provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.

 

 

(c) Certain Waivers. Each Guarantor waives (i) any defense arising by reason
of any disability or other defense of the Issuer or any other guarantor, or
the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of
the Noteholder) of the liability of the Issuer;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed
or are more burdensome than those of the Issuer; (iii) the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder; (iv)
any right to require the Noteholder to proceed against the Issuer, proceed
against or exhaust any security for the Indebtedness, or pursue any other
remedy in the Noteholder's power whatsoever; (v) any benefit of and any right
to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Noteholder; and
(vi) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or
benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the
liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly
waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for
payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests,
notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of
any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and
all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or
incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.

 

 

(d) Subrogation. Each Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation,
contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any
payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and
performed in full. If any amounts are paid to such Guarantor in violation of
the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Noteholder and shall forthwith be paid to the Noteholder to
reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured.

 

 

(e) Termination; Reinstatement. (i) This Guaranty is a continuing and
irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter
existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed
Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are
indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case
may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor is
made, or the Noteholder exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any
part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the Noteholder in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or
such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Noteholder is in
possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any
prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations
of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of
this Guaranty.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 8(e)(i) above, if any Guarantor ceases to be a
co-borrower or a guarantor of the obligations under the Credit Agreement
pursuant to the terms thereof, such Guarantor shall be automatically released
from its Guaranty without any further action from the Noteholder.

 

 

(f) Additional Guarantors. To the extent that any Subsidiary shall become
a co-borrower or a guarantor of the obligations under the Credit
Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof, the Issuer will cause concurrently
such Subsidiary to execute a joinder agreement in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Noteholder, whereupon such
Subsidiary shall become a "Guarantor" as defined herein.

10. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Note shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor may assign its rights and obligations under this Note other than pursuant to a Permitted Merger. The Noteholder may at any time assign its rights and obligations under this Note (which assignment shall be in respect of not less than all of its obligations hereunder) to any other Person with the consent of the Issuer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that the Issuer shall have been offered the right of first refusal with respect to such assignment (other than any assignment as collateral security for Indebtedness) for a period of 30 days and the Issuer shall have elected not to exercise such right upon the earlier to occur of such election or the expiry of such 30 day period, and provided further that, in no event shall the Issuer be required to consent to a potential assignee that has been determined by the majority of the directors of the board of directors unaffiliated with the Noteholder to be an "Adverse Person".
