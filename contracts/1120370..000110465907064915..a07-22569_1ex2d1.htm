 **ARTICLE 2 
 SALE AND TRANSFER OF SHARES; PURCHASE PRICE; SECTION 338(H)(10) ADJUSTMENT**

  

 **2.1 _Shares_**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, Sellers will sell and transfer the Shares to Buyer, and Buyer
will purchase the Shares from Sellers.

  

 **2.2 _Purchase Price_**. The purchase price (the " _ _Purchase Price__ ")
for the Shares is One Hundred Twenty Eight Million Two Hundred Ninety One
Thousand Six Hundred Two and 88/100 Dollars ($128,291,602.88) plus the Final
Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment.

  

 **2.3 _Payment of Purchase Price_**. The Purchase Price shall be paid by
Buyer as follows:

  

(a) _Cash Purchase Price_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Sellers in cash
the sum of Sixty Four Million One Hundred Forty Five Thousand Eight Hundred
One and 44/100 Dollars ($64,145,801.44), (" _ _Cash Purchase Price__ "), Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of which Sellers authorize Buyer to deposit in
the Escrow Account on behalf of Sellers pursuant to Section 2.3(c) below (the
" _ _Cash Escrow Deposit__ "), plus the Estimated Section 338(h)(10)
Adjustment.

  

(b) _Stock Purchase Price_. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.3(c) below, at the Closing Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock

        

equal to the sum of Sixty Four Million One Hundred Forty Five Thousand Eight
Hundred One and 44/100 Dollars ($64,145,801.44) _divided by_ the Price Per
Share, which the parties acknowledge and agree is Four Dollars ($4.00) per
share and shall result in the issuance of Sixteen Million Thirty Six Thousand
Four Hundred Fifty (16,036,450) shares of Buyer Common Stock to Sellers at
Closing, adjusted proportionately for any stock dividends, stock splits,
combination of shares or other change in Buyers capital structure between
the date hereof and the Closing Date. The aggregate value of such Buyer
Common Stock delivered to the Sellers at Closing combined with the aggregate
value of Buyer common stock deposited directly in the Escrow Account is
referred to herein as the " _ _Stock Purchase Price__ ", with such value
being determined by multiplying the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock so
delivered or deposited by the Per Share Price.

  

(c) _Escrow Amount_. To secure and to serve as a fund in respect of the
indemnification obligations of Sellers under this Agreement, Buyer, Sellers
and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Escrow Agent, **** (the " _ _Escrow Agent__
"), at Closing shall enter into an Escrow Agreement substantially in the
form annexed hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _ _Escrow Agreement__ "). At the
Closing, Buyer shall deposit (i) Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) of Buyer
Common Stock (based upon the determination of Price Per Share at Closing
without the application of the 0.80 multiplier), and (ii) the Cash Escrow
Deposit (the " _ _Escrow Amount__ ") with the Escrow Agent to be held in an
account (collectively, the " _ _Escrow Account__ ") pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.  Except with respect to amounts that have been
previously paid from the Escrow Account to Buyer pursuant to the joint
written instruction of Sellers and Buyer, and except with respect to
indemnity claims duly made in accordance with _ARTICLE 11_ on or before the
eighteen (18) month anniversary date of the Closing Date, all amounts in the
Escrow Account (with any interest or other earnings paid thereon) shall be
distributed to Sellers in accordance with the Escrow Agreement within five
(5) business days after the expiration of said eighteen (18) month escrow
period (the " _ _Escrow Period__ ").

  

(d) _Method of Cash Payment_. All cash payments made under this _Section 2.3_
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the recipient.

  

(e) _Each Seller_. As between Sellers, any Purchase Price payable to Sellers,
or payments payable to Sellers from the Escrow Account, shall be paid pro
rata among the Sellers based on such Sellers equity ownership percentage of
the Company immediately prior to the Closing. No fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock will be issued to the Sellers. Sellers shall receive cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which any such Seller
would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to the Contemplated Transactions
at the Price Per Share without the 0.80 multiplier applied.

  

 **2.4 _Code Section 338(h)(10) Election_**. Buyer and Sellers will join in
making, and will take any and all action necessary to effect, a timely and
irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and the Treasury
Regulations and administrative pronouncements thereunder) and any comparable
provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law. Buyer and Seller shall file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) election
and will not take any position contrary thereto.

        

 **2.5 _Payment of Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment_**.

  

(a) _Closing Date Payment_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Sellers
in cash the estimated amount of Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment as of the
Closing Date as calculated in writing by Sellers and delivered to Buyer not
less than two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date (the " _
_Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment__ ").

  

(b) _Post Closing Reconciliation_. As soon as practicable after the Closing,
but in no event more than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer and
Sellers shall mutually determine the final Section 338(h)(10) adjustment (the
" _ _Final Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment__ "). In the event the Final Section
338(h)(10) Adjustment exceeds the Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment,
then Buyer shall pay such excess to Sellers promptly in cash. In the event
the Final Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment is less than the Estimated Section
338(h)(10) Adjustment then Sellers shall pay Buyer the amount by which the
Estimated Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment exceeds the Final Section 338(h)(10)
Adjustment promptly in cash. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to agree to the
amount of the Final Section 338(h)(10) Adjustment within said sixty (60) day
period, such determination shall be made by the Neutral Accountants,
whose determination shall be final and binding upon the parties.

shall not in any manner without the prior written consent of the Sellers

may have at law or in equity, Buyer shall be obligated to provide to Sellers

 **ARTICLE 7 
 POST-CLOSING COVENANTS**

  

 **7.1 _Covenant Not to Compete_**. From and after Closing, Sellers covenant
and agree as follows:

  

(a) _Restricted Period_. As used in this Article 7, the term "
_Restricted Period_ " means the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

(b) _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. In order to allow Buyer to realize
the full benefit of its bargain in connection with the purchase of the
Shares, none of the Sellers will at any time during the Restricted Period,
directly or indirectly, acting alone or

        

as a member of a partnership or as a holder of any security of any class, or
as an employee, consultant to or representative of, any corporation or other
business entity:

  

(i) engage in, continue in or carry on any business which directly competes
with the Business or the businesses conducted by Buyer or its Affiliates as
of the Closing Date, including owning or controlling any financial interest
in any corporation, partnership, firm or other form of business organization
which is so engaged;

  

(ii) solicit any customers of the Company or of Buyer or its Affiliates for
purposes of offering products that are directly competitive with the products
offered by the Business or of Buyer or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date;
 or

  

(iii) hire, offer to hire, or solicit for employment any employee of the
Company, Buyer or its Affiliates, without the prior consent of Buyer, until
such employee has been separated from employment by the Company, Buyer or its
Affiliates for at least one year.

  

(c) _Severability; Reformation; Equitable Relief_. Sellers acknowledge that
if the scope of the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.1_  is deemed to
be too broad in any court proceeding, the court may reduce the scope as it
deems reasonable under the circumstances. Buyer would not have any adequate
remedy at law for the breach or threatened breach by either Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates of the covenants and agreements set forth in this
_Section 7.1_ and, accordingly, Buyer and the Company may, in addition to the
other remedies which may be available to it hereunder, file suit in equity to
enjoin the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates from such breach
or threatened breach and Sellers consent to the issuance of injunctive relief
hereunder. The act of Buyer in entering into this Agreement, and Buyers
covenants and payments hereunder, constitute sufficient consideration for
Sellers to agree not to compete against Buyer or the Company as set out in
this _Section 7.1_.

  

 **7.2 _Certain Tax Matters._**

  

(a) _Income Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all
Income Tax Returns of the Company required to be filed after Closing for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, including all short
taxable years ending on the Closing Date. Buyer shall provide Sellers or
their designees the opportunity to review a substantially completed draft of
each such Income Tax Return at least ten (10) business days prior to the
filing of such Income Tax Return, and reasonable access to the Person(s)
actually responsible for preparing such Income Tax Returns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing rights provided to Sellers or their designee
will in no way affect (whether or not and regardless of the extent to which
Sellers exercise such rights) the nature and scope of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities of Sellers contained
in this Agreement. Sellers shall timely file such Income Tax Returns and pay
(or cause to be paid) all Taxes relating to all periods ending on or before
the Closing Date (including, without limitation, any built-in gain tax that
will be incurred by the Company as a result of the Closing or the Section
338(h)(10) election referenced in _Section 2.4_ ).

        

(b) _Cooperation; Audit_. After the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, including the Company,
to, cooperate in the preparation of all Tax Returns and shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to the requesting party any records or other
information requested by such party in connection therewith as well as access
to, and the cooperation of, the auditors of Buyer and Sellers.  Sellers, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to each
other of any proposed adjustment to Taxes for periods ending on or before the
Closing Date (or beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date).  Promptly upon receipt by either party of any notification or
indication (whether written or oral) from the IRS or any state or other
taxing authority that it intends to investigate or audit any pre-Closing Tax
Return, the party receiving such information shall notify the other party and
convey such information to the other party in writing.  Each party shall
cooperate with the other in connection with any Tax investigation, Tax audit,
or other Tax proceeding. A party shall be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in taking any action requested by the other party or
parties under this _Section 7.2(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not alter any indemnification rights to which Buyer
or Sellers are entitled under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
under  _ARTICLE 11_.

  

(c) _Post Closing Tax Payment_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date Buyer shall pay to Sellers in cash all Taxes for which Sellers are
obligated with respect to their respective net distributable share of the
Companys income for the period commencing July 1, 2007 and ending at the
close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date which is
passed through to the Sellers under Section 1366 of the Code. For purposes of
calculating the Tax payment to be made by Buyer to Sellers under this Section
7.2(c) each Seller shall be deemed to be in the highest marginal tax bracket
for local, state and Federal Tax purposes.

  

 **7.3 _Further Assurances_**. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request
to each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each
other such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as
the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the
intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  

 **7.4 _Litigation Support_**. In the event and for so long as Buyer
or Company is actively contesting or defending against any litigation or
claim in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act or transaction existing or occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date involving the Company or the Business, Sellers will cooperate in
the contest or defense and provide such testimony as may be necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, at the cost and expense of Buyer
(unless and to the extent Buyer is entitled to indemnification therefor
hereunder).

not be satisfied; _provided_ , that if the inaccuracy in Buyers

Materiality Qualifier contained in any representations, warranties or
covenants shall be disregarded when determining the existence of a breach or

 **11.5 _Procedure for Indemnification_**. Subject to the other terms of this
ARTICLE 11:

  

(a) _Notice of Indemnifiable Loss_. In the event that a Person entitled
to indemnification under this _ARTICLE 11_ (the " _ _Indemnified Party__ ")
shall suffer any Adverse Consequences in respect of which indemnification may
be sought under this  _ARTICLE 11_ against the party required to provide
indemnification under this _ARTICLE 11_ (the " _ _Indemnifying Party__ "),
the Indemnified Party must assert a claim for indemnification within the
applicable Survival Period by a written notice which contains reasonably
sufficient detail and information of the Indemnifiable Losses as then known
(the " _ _Notice of Indemnifiable Loss__ ") to the Indemnifying Party. The
Notice of Indemnifiable Loss must be provided to the Indemnifying Party as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the Indemnified
Party acquires knowledge of the basis for the claim for indemnification.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure to provide the
Indemnifying Party with a Notice of Indemnifiable Loss in such a timely
manner shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it
may have to the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE 11_ except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the
Indemnified Partys failure to give such Notice of Indemnifiable Loss in such
a timely manner.

        

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

  

(i) In the event that any third party (including any Governmental Body)
asserts a claim against an Indemnified Party for which such Indemnified Party
intends to seek indemnity from the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand
and the amount thereof, if known, or an estimate thereof, if reasonably
capable of estimation (the " _ _Claim Notice__ "), but any failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that
it may have to the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE 11_ except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the
Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.

  

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) days from Claim Notice to
undertake, conduct and control the defense of such third party claim;
_provided_ , that pending the Indemnifying Partys decision whether to
exercise its right to undertake the conduct and control of the settlement or
defense of any third party claim, the Indemnified Party shall undertake,
conduct and control the settlement or defense thereof, through counsel of its
own choosing if the failure to so act during such period might reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Party, and
_provided_ _further_ that (A) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party, in writing, within such 15 days that the Indemnifying Party will
assume the defense of the third party claim and pay all attorneys fees and
other third party defense costs in connection therewith, (B) the Indemnifying
Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have the financial
resources to defend against the third party claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder, (C) the third party claim involves
only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief,
and (iv) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently.

  

(iii) All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending
such third party claim shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, at its sole
cost and expense. So long as the Indemnifying Party is defending such third
party claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such claim
and any settlement in violation of this restriction shall nullify and make
void and unenforceable the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligation
hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to pay or settle any such third party claim; _provided_ , that
in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the
Indemnifying Party.

  

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
30 days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys Claim Notice that it
elects to undertake the settlement or defense thereof, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to conduct and control the defense thereof and to
contest, settle or

        

compromise the third party claim but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(v) The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise
any third party claim unless: (x) such settlement or judgment includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such
claim to all Indemnified Parties an unconditional release from all Liability
with respect to such claim and (y) the relief provided in connection with
such settlement or judgment effected by the Indemnifying Party is satisfied
entirely by the Indemnifying Party.  To the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall control or participate in the defense or settlement of any third party
claim or demand, the Indemnified Party will give to the Indemnifying Party
and its counsel access to, during normal business hours, the relevant books
and records, and shall permit them to consult with the employees and counsel
of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party, at its sole cost
and expense, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the
defense of all such claims.

  

(vi) With respect to any pending action or proceeding subject to
indemnification under this _ARTICLE 11_ , the parties shall cooperate in such
a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality
of all confidential business records and the attorney-client and work-product
privileges.  In connection therewith, (A) each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, in any action or proceeding in which he or
it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of
confidential business records (consistent with applicable law and rules of
procedure), and (B) all communications between any party hereto and counsel
responsible for or participating in the defense of any action or proceeding
shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to reserve any applicable
attorney-client or work-product privilege.

  

 **11.6 _Additional Agreements Regarding Indemnity_**.

  

(a) _Waivers_. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment
of Adverse Consequences, or other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants, and obligations.

  

(b) _Reliance_. The right to indemnification, payment of Adverse Consequences
or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any Knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation.

        

(c) _Company_. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing, the
Company shall be Buyer Indemnified Persons and shall have no Liability to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to any Adverse Consequences under this
Agreement, and the Sellers shall have sole responsibility for any and all
such Adverse Consequences. Sellers waive any subrogation or other
claims against the Company with respect to Adverse Consequences under this
Agreement.

  

 **11.7 _Effect of Taxes, Insurance and Other Sources of Reimbursement_**.
The amount of any Adverse Consequences for which indemnification is provided
under this Article 11 shall be reduced by (i) the insurance proceeds received
or receivable with respect to any such Adverse Consequence and (ii) any
other amount, if any, recovered from third parties (as a result of
indemnification, contribution, guarantee or otherwise) by the Indemnified
Party (or its Affiliates) with respect to any Adverse Consequences.  If any
Indemnified Party shall have received any indemnification payment pursuant to
this Article 11 with respect to any Adverse Consequence, such Indemnified
Party shall, upon written request by the Indemnifying Party, assign to such
Indemnifying Party (to the extent of the indemnification payment) any claim
which such Indemnified Party may have under any applicable insurance policy
or other Contract which provides coverage for such Adverse Consequence to the
extent of such indemnification payment, net of any increase in premiums or
other costs resulting solely from such payment. Such Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) to collect
under such insurance policy or other Contract. If any Indemnified Party shall
have received any payment pursuant to this Article 11 with respect to any
Adverse Consequence and has or shall subsequently have received insurance
proceeds or other amounts with respect to such Adverse Consequence, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the
amount so recovered (after deducting the amount of the expenses incurred by
it in procuring such recovery and any increase in premiums resulting solely
from such recovery), but not in excess of the amount previously so paid by
the Indemnifying Party. Payments received by any Party pursuant to this
Article 11 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

  

 **11.8 _No Additional Warranties_**. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONTAINED HEREIN ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES GIVEN BY THE
PARTIES. NEITHER SELLERS NOR THE COMPANY HAS MADE NOR HEREBY MAKES ANY
WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WHATSOEVER REGARDING THE FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, QUALITY OR MERCHANTABILITY OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS OR ANY PORTION
THEREOF.

  

 **11.9 _Other Information_**. Buyer agrees that neither Sellers nor any of
their Representatives will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyers use of,
any information, document, or material made available to Buyer or its
Representatives by Sellers, the Company or Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin in
certain "data rooms" (electronic or otherwise) except to the extent set forth
on the Schedules hereto. In connection with Buyers investigation of the
Company and the Business, Buyer may have received from or on behalf of
Sellers or the Company certain projections, including projected statements of
operating revenues and income from operations of the Company. Buyer
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar
with such

        

uncertainties, that Buyer is making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and forecasts), and that Buyer shall have no
claim against Sellers or their Affiliates or Representatives or the Company
with respect thereto. Accordingly, Sellers make no representation or warranty
with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts).

  

 **ARTICLE 12 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

 **12.1 _Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each of the and the Sellers will bear their respective investment
banking, fairness opinion, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses
relating to the Contemplated Transactions. This shall include the fees of
Houlihan Lokey, or any other investment banking firm retained by the Company
or the Sellers in connection with the Contemplated Transactions and all
expenses associated with the audit of the Companys financial statements
required in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, each of which
shall be paid by the Sellers.

  

 **12.2 _Public Announcements_**. Any public announcement or similar
publicity with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions
will be issued, if at all, at such time and in such manner as Buyer
determines. Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative with a draft of
any public announcement with respect to the Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions and a reasonable opportunity to comment on such public
announcement.  Unless consented to by Buyer in advance or required by
Legal Requirements, prior to the Closing Sellers and the Company shall keep
this Agreement strictly confidential and may not make any disclosure of
this Agreement to any Person. Sellers, the Company and Buyer will consult
with each other concerning the means by which the Company employees,
customers, and suppliers and others having dealings with the Company will be
informed of the Contemplated Transactions, and Buyer will have the right to
be present for any such communication.

  

 **12.3 _Confidentiality_**. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, Buyer, Sellers and the Company will maintain in confidence,
and will cause the directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors of
Buyer and the Company to maintain in confidence, any written, oral, or
other information obtained in confidence from another party or the Company
in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, unless
(a) such information is already known to such party or to others not bound by
a duty of confidentiality or such information becomes publicly available
through no fault of such party, (b) the use of such information is necessary
or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, or (c) the
furnishing or use of such information is required by legal proceedings. If
the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated, each party will return or
destroy as much of such written information as the other party may reasonably
request. Whether or not the Closing takes place, Sellers and the Company
waive any cause of action, right, or claim arising out of the access of Buyer
or its representatives to any trade secrets or other confidential information
of the Company except for the intentional competitive misuse by Buyer of such
trade secrets or confidential information.

        

 **12.4 _Notices_**. All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications
under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly
given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b)
sent by telecopier or other electronic transmission (with
written confirmation of receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by
registered mail, return receipt requested, or (c) when received by the
addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service

 **12.5 _Sellers  Representative._**

  

(a) _Appointment_. " _ _Sellers  Representative__" means Mr. Drecoll
_provided,_ that in the event of the death or resignation of him as Sellers
Representative, "Sellers Representative" means Mrs. Joan Drecoll. Each
Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and

        

appoints the Sellers Representative as such Sellers attorney-in-fact and
agent to act in such Sellers name, place and stead in connection with all
matters arising from and under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
acknowledges that such appointment is coupled with an interest.  Sellers
Representative hereby accepts such appointment and authorization.

  

(b) _Authority_. Each Seller agrees to be bound by all notices received or
given by, and all agreements and determinations made by, and all documents
executed and delivered by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement;
authorizes the Sellers Representative to assert claims, make demands and
commence actions on behalf of Sellers under this Agreement, dispute or to
refrain from disputing any claim made by Sellers, negotiate and compromise
any dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising
remedies available to Sellers under, this Agreement, and to sign any releases
or other documents with respect to such dispute or remedy (and to
bind Sellers in so doing), give such instructions and do such other things
and refrain from doing such things as the Sellers Representative shall
deem appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, give any and
all consents and notices under this agreement, and perform all actions,
exercise all powers, and fulfill all duties otherwise assigned to the
Sellers Representative in this Agreement. Each of the Sellers hereby
expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers Representative has the
sole and exclusive authority to act on such Sellers behalf in respect of all
matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement after execution of
this Agreement, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among them, and
that no Seller shall have any authority to act unilaterally or independently
of the Sellers Representative in respect to any such matter. Buyer and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken by the
Sellers Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement without
any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of Sellers. All notices,
counter notices or other instruments or designations delivered by any Sellers
in regard to this Agreement shall not be effective unless, but shall be
effective if, signed by the Sellers Representative, and if not, such
document shall have no force or effect whatsoever and Buyer, the Escrow Agent
and any other person or entity may proceed without regard to any such
document. Buyer, the Escrow Agent and any other person or entity are hereby
expressly authorized to rely on the genuineness of the signature of the
Sellers Representative, and upon receipt of any writing that reasonably
appears to have been signed by the Sellers Representative, they may act upon
the same without any further duty of inquiry as to the genuineness of the
writing. The authorizations of the Sellers Representative shall be
irrevocable and effective until the Sellers Representatives rights and
obligations under this Agreement terminate by virtue of the termination of
all obligations of Sellers to Buyer, and Buyer to Sellers, under this
Agreement. Buyer shall have no liability for any acts or omissions of the
Sellers Representative or otherwise with respect to any claim brought by any
Seller against the other Seller.

  

 **12.6 _Exhibits and Schedules_**.  All Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedules attached hereto and referred to herein are hereby incorporated
herein and made a part of this Agreement for all purposes as if fully set
forth herein. The inclusion of any item on any Disclosure Schedule attached
hereto shall not constitute an admission that such item is material or that a
violation, right of termination, default, liability or other obligation of
any kind exists with respect to such item, but rather is intended only to
qualify certain representations and warranties in this Agreement and to set
forth other information required by the Agreement. The Disclosure Schedules
attached hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to specific
provisions of this

        

Agreement. Summaries of, or references to, actual documents and other
materials in the Disclosure Schedules are qualified in their entirety by the
full text of such documents. Except as expressly set forth on the
attached Disclosure Schedules, the definitions contained in the Agreement
are incorporated therein by reference. The disclosures in the Disclosure
Schedules, and those in any Supplement thereto, must relate only to the
representations and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to which they
expressly relate and not to any other representation or warranty in this
Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the
body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Schedules (other than an
exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules with
respect to a specifically identified representation or warranty), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

  

 **12.7 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_**. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF ILLINOIS OTHER THAN CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF
DIRECTING THE APPLICATION OF ANY LAW OTHER THAN THAT OF ILLINOIS. COURTS
WITHIN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS (LOCATED WITHIN THE CITY OF CHICAGO) WILL HAVE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. THE
PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH
COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES, AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH
DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT
(A) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS;
(B) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYS PROPERTY IS IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS
ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS; OR (C) ANY LITIGATION COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

  

 **12.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_**.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING (WHETHER
BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS
OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

  

 **12.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_**. Nothing herein expressed or implied
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, such
third parties specifically including employees and creditors of the Company.

  

 **12.10 _Waiver_**. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement
are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by
any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement
or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of
such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any
such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise
of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power,
or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no
claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in

        

this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a
waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to
or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of
such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.

  

 **12.11 _Entire Agreement and Modification_**. Except for the Confidentiality
Agreement between Tontine Capital Partners, LP and the Company dated May 16,
2007 and the Confidentiality Agreement between Tower Tech Systems, Inc. and
the Company dated June 14, 2007, each of which shall not be deemed cancelled
and superseded by this Agreement, this Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter (including
the Letter of Intent among Buyer, Sellers and the Company dated July 20,
2007) and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this
Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may
not be amended except by a written instrument signed by Buyer and Sellers.

  

 **12.12 _Assignments and Successors_**. No party may assign any of its rights
under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other parties, except
that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to any
Subsidiary of Buyer; provided, however, that no such assignment by Buyer
shall release or relieve Buyer of any obligation or liability hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding
in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and
permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

  

 **12.13 _Severability_**. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

  

 **12.14 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_**. In this Agreement,
except to the extent otherwise provided or that the context otherwise
requires: (a) when a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Paragraph, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference is to an Article or
Section or Paragraph of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated; the Exhibits and Schedules form part of and shall have
effect as if set out in this Agreement and any reference to this "Agreement"
includes the Exhibits and the Schedules; (b) the table of contents and
headings for this Agreement, are for reference purposes only and do
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement; (c)
whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they are deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(d) the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import,
when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement; (e) all terms defined in this
Agreement have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto, unless otherwise defined therein;
(f) the terms defined in the singular shall have a

        

comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa; (g) references to
a Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns; (h) the use of

(i) the term "Dollars" or "$" shall refer to the currency of the United

 **12.15 _Time of Essence_**. With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
