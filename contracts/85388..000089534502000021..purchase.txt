outstanding  against  Target or any Target  Subsidiary  of which Target has
Knowledge and which would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Target Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.14. Taxes. Except as set forth in Section 3.14 of the Target
Disclosure Letter:

          (a) Target and each Target  Subsidiary  has timely  filed all Tax
Returns  required  to be filed by it (after  giving  effect  to any  filing
extension properly granted by a Governmental  Entity having authority to do
so or otherwise  permitted by Law).  Each such Tax Return is true,  correct
and complete in all material  respects.  Target and each Target  Subsidiary
has paid,  within the time and in the manner  prescribed  by Law, all Taxes
that are due and payable. The most recent financial statements contained in
the Target  Filings and the financial  statements of Hexalon filed prior to
the  date  of  this  Agreement  reflect  an  adequate  reserve  or  accrued
liabilities  or  expenses  for all Taxes due and  payable by Target and the
Target  Subsidiaries  for all taxable periods and portions  thereof through
the date of such financial statements.  Target has established on its books
and records  reserves or accrued  liabilities or expenses that are adequate
for the payment of all Taxes for which Target or any Target  Subsidiary  is
liable but are not yet due and payable. No deficiencies for Taxes have been
asserted or assessed in writing by a Governmental  Entity against Target or
any Target  Subsidiary,  including claims by any  Governmental  Entity in a
jurisdiction  where  Target  or any  Target  Subsidiary  does  not file Tax
Returns  and no  requests  for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes
have been granted and remain in effect or are pending.

          (b)  All  Taxes  which  Target  or the  Target  Subsidiaries  are
required by Law to withhold or collect,  including  Taxes  required to have
been  withheld in  connection  with amounts paid or owing to any  employee,
independent  contractor,  creditor,  stockholder  or other  third party and
sales,  gross receipts and use taxes,  have been duly withheld or collected
and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper Governmental
Entities or are held in separate bank accounts for such purpose.  There are
no Encumbrances for Taxes upon the assets of the Target Subsidiaries except
for statutory Encumbrances for Taxes not yet due.

          (c) The Tax Returns of Target and any Target  Subsidiary have not
been  audited  by any  taxing  authority  and  there  are no  audits by and
contests with any taxing authority currently being conducted with regard to
Taxes or Tax  Returns  of  Target,  any  Target  Subsidiary  and any Target
Non-Purchased  Entity and, to the Knowledge of Target,  there are no audits
pending with or proposed by any taxing  authority with respect to any Taxes
or Tax Returns.

          (d) None of Target or the Target  Subsidiaries have any liability
for the Taxes of any Person  other than  Target or the Target  Subsidiaries
and Target and the Target  Subsidiaries  do not have any  liability for the
Taxes of any Person other than Target or the Target Subsidiaries either (i)
under Treasury  Regulation  Section  1.1502-6 (or any similar  provision of
state,  local or  foreign  Law) or (ii) to the  Knowledge  of  Target  as a
transferee or successor.

          (e)  Each  Target  Subsidiary  that  is a  U.S.  corporation  has
disclosed  to the IRS all  positions  taken on  their  federal  income  Tax
Returns which could give rise to a substantial  understatement of Tax under
Section 6662 of the Code.

          (f) Based on the assumptions as to purchase price  allocations to
specific  assets  provided by the  Purchasers'  and as set forth in the Pro
Forma Tax Returns,  the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement and the  Transaction  Documents will not result in any Taxes
being   payable  by  any  Target,   any  Target   Subsidiary,   any  Target
Non-Purchased  Entity or any Purchaser to any Governmental  Entity,  except
for (i)  Excluded  Taxes,  (ii)  Transfer  and  Gain  Taxes  not  exceeding
$15,000,000  in the aggregate and (iii) other Taxes in an aggregate  amount
not to exceed $3,000,000.

          (g) Target (i) has been  subject to  taxation  as a BI within the
meaning of Article 28 of the Netherlands  Corporate Income Tax Act of 1969,
as amended,  commencing with the first taxable year of its operations,  and
has  satisfied all  requirements  to qualify as a BI for such year and each
year thereafter,  (ii) has operated, and intends to continue to, operate in
such  manner as to qualify as a BI until the Closing and until the time the
proceeds  from  the  proceeds  from the  Purchase  are  distributed  to the
shareholders of Target in accordance with the Protocol.

          (h) Hexalon (i) has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the
meaning of Section 856 of the Code  commencing  with the first taxable year
of its operations,  and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT
for such year and each year thereafter,  (ii) has operated,  and intends to
continue  to  operate,  in such a manner  as to  qualify  as a REIT for the
taxable year ending December 31, 2001, and thereafter until the Closing and
has no liability for taxes under Section 11, 857(b),  860(c) or 4981 of the
Code and (iii) has not taken or  omitted  to take any  action  which  would
reasonably  be  expected  to (A) result in any rents paid by the tenants of
the  Properties  to be  excluded  from the  definition  of "rents from real
property" under Section  856(d)(2)(C) of the Code, or (B) otherwise  result
in a challenge  to its status as a REIT,  and no such  challenge is pending
or, to the Knowledge of Target is  threatened.  Each  Subsidiary of Hexalon
and any Person  Hexalon owns an interest in which is a  partnership,  joint
venture or limited  liability  company (i) has been since its formation and
continues to be treated for federal  income tax  purposes as a  partnership
and not as a corporation  or an  association  taxable as a  corporation  or
ignored  as a separate  entity,  as the case may be, and (ii) has not since
its formation owned any assets (including, without limitation,  securities)
that would cause  Hexalon to violate  Section  856(c)(4) of the Code.  Each
Subsidiary of Hexalon which is a corporation  or treated as an  association
taxable as a corporation  and any Person in which Hexalon owns 10% or more,
by  vote  or by  value,  of  such  Person's  outstanding  securities,  is a
qualified  REIT  subsidiary  under Section  856(i) of the Code or a taxable
REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code.

          (i)  Except  as  set  forth  in  the  Urban  Tax  Indemnification
Agreement,  neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary has entered into or is
subject,  directly or indirectly,  to any "Tax  Protection  Agreements." As
used herein, a Tax Protection  Agreement is an agreement,  oral or written,
(A) that has as one of its  purposes  to  permit a person or entity to take
the position that such person or entity could defer federal  taxable income
that otherwise  might have been  recognized  upon a transfer of property to
the Target  Partnership or any other Target Subsidiary that is treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes,  and (B) that (i) prohibits or
restricts  in any  manner  the  disposition  of any assets of Target or any
Target Subsidiary,  (including, without limitation, requiring Target or any
Target Subsidiary to indemnify any person for any tax liabilities resulting
from any  such  disposition),  (ii)  requires  that  Target  or any  Target
Subsidiary maintain, or put in place, or replace, indebtedness,  whether or
not secured by one or more of the Target Properties, or (iii) requires that
Target or any Target  Subsidiary  offer to any person or entity at any time
the opportunity to guarantee or otherwise  assume,  directly or indirectly,
the risk of loss for federal income tax purposes for  indebtedness or other
liabilities of Target or any Target Subsidiary.

          (j) Neither  Target nor any Target  Subsidiary  is a party to, is
bound  by or has  an  obligation  under  any  Tax  sharing  agreement,  Tax
indemnification  agreement or similar  contract or arrangement  (other than
Urban Tax Indemnification Agreement),  including any agreement, contract or
arrangement  providing  for the sharing or ceding of credits or losses,  or
has a potential  liability or  obligation as a result of or pursuant to any
such agreement,  contract,  arrangement or commitment. No closing agreement
pursuant to section 7121 of the Code (or any predecessor  provision) or any
similar  provision of any state,  local or foreign has been entered into by
or on  behalf of the  Target or any  Subsidiary.  No power of  attorney  or
similar  document which is currently in force has been granted by Target or
any Target Subsidiary with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

     SECTION 3.15. Pension and Benefit Plans; ERISA. Except as set forth in
Section 3.15 of the Target Disclosure Letter:

          (a) All "employee  pension  benefit plans," as defined in Section
3(2) of  ERISA,  maintained  or  contributed  to by  Target or any trade or
business  (whether or not incorporated)  which is under common control,  or
which is treated as a single  employer,  with Target under Section  414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a "Target ERISA Affiliate") or to which Target
or any of the Target Subsidiaries or any Target ERISA Affiliate contributed
or is  obligated  to  contribute  thereunder  within six years prior to the
Closing (the "Target Pension Plans")  intended to qualify under Section 401
of the Code have received a favorable determination letter from the IRS and
such determination has not been modified,  revoked or limited,  and, to the
Knowledge  of Target as of the  Closing  Date,  nothing has  occurred  with
respect to the operation of Target  Pension Plans that could  reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of such  qualification  or the imposition of any
material liability, penalty or Tax under ERISA or the Code.

          (b)  Neither  Target nor any  Target  ERISA  Affiliate  currently
sponsors, contributes to, maintains or has liability (whether contingent or
otherwise)  under  (i)  a  "multiemployer  plan"  (as  defined  in  Section
4001(a)(3)  of  ERISA)  or (ii) an  employee  benefit  plan  that is or was
subject  to Part 3 of  Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA,  Section  412 of the
Code, or Title IV of ERISA.

          (c) To the Knowledge of Target, there is no violation of ERISA or
the Code with respect to (i) the filing of applicable  reports,  documents,
and notices with the  Secretary of Labor and the  Secretary of the Treasury
regarding  all  "employee  benefit  plans," as  defined in Section  3(3) of
ERISA,  and all other employee  compensation  and benefit  arrangements  or
payroll  practices,  including,  without  limitation,  severance  pay, sick
leave,  vacation pay, salary  continuation  for  disability,  consulting or
other compensation  agreements,  retirement,  deferred compensation,  bonus
(including,  without  limitation,  any  retention  bonus  plan),  long-term
incentive,   stock  option,   stock  purchase,   hospitalization,   medical
insurance,  life insurance and scholarship programs maintained by Target or
any of the Target  Subsidiaries  or with  respect to which Target or any of
the Target Subsidiaries has any liability or Target Pension Plans (all such
plans, including Target Pension Plans, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Target  Employee  Benefit Plans") or (ii) the furnishing of such documents
to the participants or beneficiaries of Target Employee Benefit Plans.

          (d) Each Target  Employee  Benefit Plan,  related trust (or other
funding or financing  arrangement) and all amendments thereto are listed in
Section 3.15(d) of the Target Disclosure  Letter,  true and complete copies
of which have been made  available to  Purchasers,  as have the most recent
summary plan descriptions,  administrative  service agreements,  Form 5500s
and,  with  respect to any Target  Employee  Benefit  Plan  intended  to be
qualified   pursuant  to  Section   401(a)  of  the  Code,  a  current  IRS
determination letter.

          (e) Each Target Employee Benefit Plan is, and its  administration
is and has been, in material compliance with, and none of Target nor any of
the Target  Subsidiaries has received any claim, notice or information that
any such Target Employee  Benefit Plan is not in compliance with, its terms
and all  applicable  Laws,  regulations,  rulings and all other  applicable
governmental  Laws,  regulations  and orders,  and  prohibited  transaction
exemptions,  including,  without  limitation,  the  requirements  of ERISA,
bonding  requirements  and the furnishing of documents to the  participants
and  beneficiaries  (and other  individuals  entitled to such documents) of
each such plan.

          (f) To  the  Knowledge  of  Target,  there  is no  liability  for
breaches of  fiduciary  duty in  connection  with Target  Employee  Benefit
Plans, and neither Target nor any of the Target  Subsidiaries or any "party
in interest"  or  "disqualified  person"  with  respect to Target  Employee
Benefit Plans has engaged in a non-exempt  "prohibited  transaction" within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA.

          (g) There are no actions, disputes, suits, claims, arbitration or
legal,  administrative  or other  proceeding or governmental  investigation
pending  (other than routine  claims for  benefits) or, to the Knowledge of
Target, threatened, alleging any breach of the terms of any Target Employee
Benefit  Plan or of any  fiduciary  duties  thereunder  or violation of any
applicable Law with respect to any such Target Employee Benefit Plan.

          (h) Neither the execution and delivery of this  Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby, whether alone, or in
connection with any other event, will (i) result in any payment (including,
but  not  limited  to,  any  retention   bonuses,   parachute  payments  or
noncompetition payments) becoming due to any employee or former employee or
group of  employees  or former  employees  of  Target or any of the  Target
Subsidiaries; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Target
Employee Benefit Plan or any Target Employment  Agreement;  (iii) result in
the  acceleration  of the time of payment or vesting of any such  rights or
benefits;  or (iv) result in the payment of any "excess parachute  payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code with respect to a current or
former employee of Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries.

          (i) There are no severance agreements or policies, noncompetition
agreements or  employment  agreements  between  Target or any of the Target
Subsidiaries and any employee of Target or such Target Subsidiary, and true
and complete copies of all severance agreements and policies and employment
agreements  described in Section  3.15(i) of the Target  Disclosure  Letter
have been provided to Purchasers.

          (j)  Neither  Target nor any of the Target  Subsidiaries  has any
consulting  agreement or  arrangement,  whether  oral or written,  with any
Person involving annual compensation in excess of $100,000.

          (k) All  contributions,  premiums and other payments  required by
Law or any Target Employee Benefit Plan or applicable collective bargaining
agreement have been made under any such plan to any fund,  trust or account
established  thereunder or in connection therewith by the due date thereof,
and  no  amounts  are or  will  be due  to  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty
Corporation  as of the Closing  Date  (except for  premiums in the ordinary
course of  business,  which  will be payable  by  Target);  and any and all
contributions,  premiums and other payments with respect to compensation or
service  before and through the Closing Date, or otherwise  with respect to
periods  before and through the Closing Date, due from any of Target or its
ERISA  Affiliates to, under or on account of each Target  Employee  Benefit
Plan  shall  have been paid  prior to the  Closing  Date or shall have been
fully reserved and provided for or accrued on Target financial statements.

          (l) No stock or other  security  issued  by  Target or any of the
Target  Subsidiaries forms or has formed a part of the assets of any Target
Employee Benefit Plan.

          (m) No Target  Employee  Benefit Plan that is a "welfare  benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA provides for continuing  benefits
or coverage for any  participant or  beneficiary or covered  dependent of a
participant after such participant's  termination of employment,  except to
the extent required by Law.

          (n) All  Target  Employee  Benefit  Plans that  provide  medical,
dental health or long-term disability benefits are fully insured and claims
with  respect to any  participant  or covered  dependent  under such Target
Employee  Benefit  Plan  could  not  reasonably  result  in  any  uninsured
liability to Target, any Target Subsidiary or Purchasers. Target and Target
ERISA   Affiliates  have  complied  in  all  material   respects  with  the
requirements  of Section  4980B of the Code and Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA  regarding  health care coverage under Target  Employee
Benefit Plans.

          (o) No amount  has been  paid by  Target  or any of Target  ERISA
Affiliates, and no amount is expected to be paid by Target or any of Target
ERISA  Affiliates,  which  would be  subject to the  provisions  of Section
162(m) of the Code such  that all or a part of such  payments  would not be
deductible by the payor.

          (p) Without limiting any other provision of this Section 3.15, no
event has  occurred  and no  condition  exists,  with respect to any Target
Employee  Benefit Plan,  that has subjected or could subject  Target or any
Target  ERISA  Affiliate,  or  any  Target  Employee  Benefit  Plan  or any
successor  thereto,  to any Tax, fine,  penalty or other  liability  (other
than, in the case of Target,  a Target ERISA  Affiliate and Target Employee
Benefit  Plans,   a  liability   arising  in  the  normal  course  to  make
contributions  or payments,  as  applicable,  when  ordinarily  due under a
Target  Employee  Benefit  Plan with respect to employees of Target and the
Target  Subsidiaries).  No event has occurred and no condition exists, with
respect to any Target Employee  Benefit Plan that could subject  Purchasers
or any of its  Affiliates,  or any plan  maintained by Purchasers or any of
their  Affiliates  (other than an Affiliate  which becomes such pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) thereof, to any Tax, fine,
penalty or other liability, that would not have been incurred by Purchasers
or any of their  Affiliates,  or any such  plan,  but for the  transactions
contemplated  hereby.  No plan other than a Target Employee Benefit Plan is
or will be directly or  indirectly  binding on  Purchasers by virtue of the
transactions   contemplated   hereby.   Purchasers  and  their  Affiliates,
including  on and after the  Closing  Date,  Target  and any  Target  ERISA
Affiliate,  to the knowledge of Target, shall have no liability for, under,
with respect to or otherwise in connection  with any plan,  which liability
arises  under  ERISA  or the  Code,  by  virtue  of  Target  or any  Target
Subsidiary  being  aggregated in a controlled  group or affiliated  service
group with any Target ERISA  Affiliate for purposes of ERISA or the Code at
any relevant  time prior to the Closing  Date (other than a liability  from
providing benefits arising in the ordinary course of business).

          (q) Each Target Employee Benefit Plan may be unilaterally amended
or  terminated  in its entirety by Target  without  liability  except as to
benefits accrued thereunder prior to amendment or termination.

          (r) All individual employment,  termination, severance, change in
control,   retention,   bonus,   post-employment   and  other  compensation
agreements,  arrangements and plans existing prior to the execution of this
Agreement  or which  will exist  prior to the  Closing,  which are  between
Target or a Target  Subsidiary and any current or former director,  officer
or employee thereof, including the name of such current or former director,
officer or employee,  the type of agreement and the amount of any estimated
severance payment (including estimated gross up) owed thereunder due to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and any subsequent termination
of employment,  are listed in Section 3.15(r) the Target  Disclosure Letter
(collectively, the "Target Employment Agreements").

     SECTION 3.16.  Labor and  Employment  Matters.  Except as set forth in
Section 3.16 of the Target  Disclosure Letter or as would not be reasonably
expected to have a Target Material Adverse Effect:

          (a) Neither Target nor any of the Target  Subsidiaries is a party
to any  collective  bargaining  agreement or other current labor  agreement
with any labor union or  organization,  and there is no question  involving
current  union  representation  of employees of Target or any of the Target
Subsidiaries, nor does Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries know of any
activity  or  proceeding  of  any  labor  organization  (or  representative
thereof) or employee group (or representative thereof) to organize any such
employees.

          (b) There is no unfair labor practice charge or grievance arising
out of a  collective  bargaining  agreement  or other  grievance  procedure
pending,  or, to the Knowledge of Target,  threatened against Target or any
of the Target Subsidiaries.

          (c) There is no complaint,  lawsuit or proceeding in any forum by
or on  behalf  of  any  present  or  former  employee,  any  applicant  for
employment or any classes of the foregoing,  alleging breach of any express
or  implied  contract  of  employment,  any  Law  or  regulation  governing
employment or the termination thereof or other discriminatory,  wrongful or
tortious  conduct in connection with the employment  relationship  pending,
or, to the  Knowledge of Target,  threatened  against  Target or any of the
Target Subsidiaries.

          (d)  There is no  strike,  slowdown,  work  stoppage  or  lockout
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Target,  threatened,  against or involving
Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries.

          (e) The  employees  of Target  and the  Target  Subsidiaries  are
lawfully  authorized  to work in the  United  States  according  to federal
immigration Laws.

          (f) Target and each of the Target  Subsidiaries are in compliance
with all applicable Laws in respect of employment and employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment,  wages,  hours of work and occupational
safety and health.

          (g) As of the date of this  Agreement,  there  is no  proceeding,
claim,  suit,  action  or  governmental  investigation  pending  or, to the
Knowledge  of Target,  threatened,  with  respect  to which any  current or
former director,  officer, employee or agent of Target or any of the Target
Subsidiaries is claiming  indemnification  from Target or any of the Target
Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 3.17.  Contracts

          (a) Section  3.17(a) of the Target  Disclosure  Letter  lists all
Material  Contracts  of Target and all Target  Subsidiaries.  Except as set
forth in Section 3.17(a) of the Target  Disclosure  Letter or in the Target
Filings,  each Material Contract of Target or a Target Subsidiary is valid,
binding and  enforceable  and in full force and effect,  except  where such
failure  to be so valid,  binding  and  enforceable  and in full  force and
effect would not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected
to have a Target  Material  Adverse  Effect,  and there are no  defaults or
violations  thereunder,  nor does there exist any condition  which upon the
passage  of  time or the  giving  of  notice  or both  would  cause  such a
violation of or a default  thereunder,  except those defaults or violations
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Target Material Adverse Effect. Target has made available, or caused
to be made  available,  to  Purchasers  true and  complete  copies  of each
Material Contract and all ancillary documents pertaining thereto.

          (b) All  mortgages,  deeds of  trust,  loan  agreements  or other
documents on any of the Assets are listed in Section  3.17(b) of the Target
Disclosure  Letter.  The  transactions   contemplated  hereby  and  by  the
Transaction  Documents will not trigger any due-on-sale provision on any of
such mortgages, deeds of trust, loan agreements or other documents,  except
as set forth in Section  3.17(b) of the Target  Disclosure  Letter and will
not  require  the consent of any  mortgage  lender,  except as set forth in
Section 3.17(b) of the Target Disclosure Letter.

          (c)  Except  as set  forth  in  Section  3.17(c)  of  the  Target
Disclosure Letter, there is no confidentiality  agreement,  non-competition
agreement  or other  contract or agreement  that  contains  covenants  that
restrict Target's ability to conduct its business in any location.

          (d)  Except  as set  forth  in  Section  3.17(d)  of  the  Target
Disclosure Letter, there are no indemnification  agreements entered into by
and  between  Target  and any  director  or officer of Target or any of the
Target Subsidiaries.

          (e) All joint venture agreements are listed in Section 3.17(e) of
the  Target  Disclosure  Letter.  The  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement and the Transaction  Documents will not trigger any  termination,
buy-sell,  transfer,  option, right of first refusal, right of first offer,
tag-along or any similar right by any party under any of such joint venture
agreements, except as set forth in Section 3.17(e) of the Target Disclosure
Letter  and will not  require  the  consent of any joint  venture  partner,
except as set forth in Section 3.17(e) of the Target Disclosure Letter.

     SECTION 3.18. Intangible Property.  Target and the Target Subsidiaries
own,  possess or have adequate rights to use all  trademarks,  trade names,
patents,  service  marks,  brand  marks,  brand names,  computer  programs,
databases,  industrial designs,  domain names and copyrights currently used
in the  operation  of the  businesses  of each  of  Target  and the  Target
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Target Intangible Property"), except where
the  failure  to  possess  or have  adequate  rights to use such  property,
individually or in the aggregate,  would not reasonably be expected to have
a Target  Material  Adverse Effect.  Section 3.18 of the Target  Disclosure
Letter sets forth a list of all trademarks,  trade names, patents,  service
marks and domain  names  owned by Target or any Target  Subsidiary.  All of
Target  Intangible  Property  is owned or  licensed by Target or the Target
Subsidiaries  free and clear of any and all  Encumbrances,  except as would
not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a
Target  Material  Adverse  Effect,  and neither  Target nor any such Target
Subsidiary has forfeited or otherwise  relinquished  any Target  Intangible
Property. To the Knowledge of Target, the use of Target Intangible Property
by Target or the  Target  Subsidiaries  does not in any  material  respect,
conflict with,  infringe  upon,  violate or interfere with or constitute an
appropriation of any right, title, interest or goodwill, including, without
limitation, any intellectual property right, trademark, trade name, patent,
service  mark,  brand  mark,  brand  name,   computer  program,   database,
industrial design,  copyright or any pending application therefore,  of any
other Person.  Except as set forth in Section 3.18 of the Target Disclosure
Letter,  to the  Knowledge of Target,  there have been no claims made,  and
neither Target nor any of the Target  Subsidiaries  has received any notice
of any claim nor does Target  otherwise  have  Knowledge that any of Target
Intangible Property is invalid or conflicts with the asserted rights of any
other  Person or has not been used or  enforced  or has failed to have been
used  or  enforced  in a  manner  that  would  result  in the  abandonment,
cancellation  or  unenforceability  of any of Target  Intangible  Property,
except  as would  not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be
expected to have a Target Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.19. Insurance.  Section 3.19 of the Target Disclosure Letter
sets forth an insurance  schedule of Target.  Target and each of the Target
Subsidiaries  maintains insurance with financially  responsible insurers in
such  amounts  and  covering  such risks as are in  accordance  with normal
industry practice for companies  engaged in businesses  similar to those of
Target  and each of the  Target  Subsidiaries.  Except as set forth in this
Section  3.19,  neither  Target  nor  any of the  Target  Subsidiaries  has
received any written notice of cancellation or termination  with respect to
any  existing  material  insurance  policy of  Target or any of the  Target
Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 3.20. Brokers. Except for the fees and expenses payable to the
Target Financial Advisor (which fees and the engagement letter with respect
to such Person have been disclosed to  Purchasers),  no broker,  investment

     (2) the  payment  of 2001  annual  bonuses in the  ordinary  course of
     business consistent with past practice (provided,  with respect to any
     employee,  the amount that the bonus  represents  as a  percentage  of

          (b) Target  and the  Target  Subsidiaries  shall  cooperate  with
Purchasers  in taking all action  reasonably  requested by  Purchasers  and
designed to reduce any Assumed Taxes or other  liabilities  arising from or
in connection with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and by
the  Transaction  Documents if and solely to the extent such actions do not
impose  any  material  costs on Target or the Target  Subsidiaries.  Target
shall confer with  Purchasers  regarding  any  actions,  elections or other
steps  relating to Taxes prior to taking any actions  materially  affecting
Taxes.

          (c) On the date hereof Target  obtained,  and on the Closing Date
Target shall obtain a letter from Arthur Andersen, LLP in the form attached
as Exhibit B hereto with respect to all prior federal income tax returns of
Hexalon and the Pro Forma Tax Returns (the "Andersen Letter").

          (d) On the date hereof Target  obtained,  and on the Closing Date
Target shall  obtain,  an opinion of Loyens & Loeff in the form attached as
Exhibit C hereto (the "Loyens Tax Opinion").

          (e) The Target  and the  Target  Subsidiaries  will  execute  and
deliver  written  instructions  to  Arnall,  Golden &  Gregory  and  Arthur

relevant  jurisdictions  reflecting  the  liabilities  of  Target  and  its
Subsidiaries for Taxes (including,  without  limitation,  withholding taxes
under  Section 1445 of the Code) arising from or incident to the closing of
the  transactions  (including  alternatively  (i) a sale of the  shares  of
Hexalon and (ii) a sale of the assets of Hexalon  and from the  liquidation
of Hexalon  thereafter)  as provided in this  Agreement (the "Pro Forma Tax
Returns").  The initial Pro Forma Tax Returns shall assume a closing of the
transactions  as of March 31, 2002 at sale prices  which  Purchasers  shall
provide to Arthur  Andersen,  LLP and the sale  prices used for the Closing
and the final Pro Forma Tax Returns shall be based on the same  assumptions
as to sales prices (subject, however, to any adjustments to sales prices to
reflect any price adjustments provided for in this Agreement and to reflect
the effect on the U.S. dollar  equivalent price for the assets in the event
more,  or fewer,  U.S.  dollar  equivalents  are  payables  for the  assets
relative to the U.S. dollar  equivalents used for the initial Pro Forma Tax
Returns)  except the closing  date shall be the date the  Purchasers  shall
indicate as the approximate date of the Closing.  The Pro Forma Tax Returns
shall disregard the results from operations other than for depreciation and
amortization deductions computed as of the Closing Date.

          (g) The parties hereto shall report for Tax purposes consistently
with the sales prices reflected in the final Pro Forma Tax Returns.

     SECTION 5.3.   Access to Information; Confidentiality.

counsel,  financial  advisors  and  other  representatives   (collectively,
"Purchasers'  Representatives"),  reasonable  access during normal business
hours and upon  reasonable  advance  notice  during the period prior to the
Closing  to  all  its  properties,  for  the  purpose  of  making  surveys,
inspections,  engineering  studies,  environmental  assessments  and  other
tests,  examinations or studies which Purchasers may deem necessary and for
the  purpose  of  inspecting  all of  the  books,  contracts,  commitments,
personnel  and records of Target,  the Target  Subsidiaries  and the Target
Non-Subsidiary  Entities and, during such period,  Target shall,  and shall
cause each of the Target  Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable efforts
to cause each Target  Non-Subsidiary Entity to, furnish reasonably promptly
to Purchasers all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Purchasers  may reasonably  request.  Target and its officers,
employees,    accountants,    counsel,   financial   advisors   and   other
representatives  shall  cooperate  in all  reasonable  respects  with  each
Purchaser  and its  accountants  in  connection  with the  preparation  and
auditing in  accordance  with Dutch GAAP of financial  statements of Target
and its  Subsidiaries  on a consolidated  basis and in connection  with the
preparation and auditing in accordance with United States GAAP of financial
statements  relating  to any of the  Target  Properties,  with  respect  to
periods  preceding  the  Closing  Date if  such  Purchaser  has  reasonably
concluded  that  such  audited   financial   statements  are  necessary  or
appropriate in connection with its reporting  obligations  under the United
States  Securities   Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  or  Australian
securities  laws within four months after the Closing or in connection with
any debt or equity  offering which may be proposed by such Purchaser  after
the date  hereof and within such four month  period.  Each  Purchaser  will
hold,  and  will  cause  its  officers,  employees,  accountants,  counsel,
financial  advisors and other  representatives  and Affiliates to hold, any
nonpublic  information  in  confidence  to the extent  required  by, and in
accordance  with,  the  provisions  of (i) that  certain  letter  agreement
between J.P.  Morgan  Securities,  Inc., on behalf of Target,  and Hoosier,
dated October 15, 2001 (the "Hoosier Confidentiality Agreement"), (ii) that
certain  letter  agreement,  dated  October 18, 2001,  between J.P.  Morgan
Securities, Inc., on behalf of Target, and Terrapin, and (iii) that certain
letter agreement between J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., on behalf of Target,
and Westfield Holdings Limited,  dated January 10, 2002 (collectively,  the
"Confidentiality Agreements").

          (b) In connection with any invasive or destructive testing of any
property  (or any portion  thereof)  of Target,  a Target  Subsidiary  or a
Target  Non-Subsidiary  Entity ("Invasive  Testing"),  Purchasers shall (i)
fully  comply with all laws,  rules and  regulations  applicable  to Target
and/or  the  Invasive  Testing  and  all  other  activities  undertaken  in
connection  therewith,  (ii)  not  interfere  materially  with  the use and
occupancy of the property by Target and the tenants  under the leases,  and
(iii) permit Target to have a  representative  present  during all Invasive
Testing undertaken hereunder. Purchasers hereby agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold  harmless  Target  and  Target's  partners,  and their  respective
officers,  directors,  employees  and agents  from and  against any and all
loss, cost,  expense,  damage,  claim and liability suffered or incurred by
Target  or any of  such  other  entities  or  persons  and  arising  out of
Purchasers' and/or Purchasers'  Representatives Invasive Testing; provided,
however,  that such  indemnity  shall not  apply to the mere  discovery  by
Purchasers  and/or  Purchasers'  Representatives  of  any  matters  if  the
discovery  thereof  imposes  liability  on Target or any other  indemnified
party.

     SECTION 5.4.   Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

          (a) Upon the terms and  subject  to the  conditions  set forth in
this  Agreement,  each Purchaser  Party, on the one hand, and Target on the
other hand agrees to use its  reasonable  best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken,  all  actions  and to do, or cause to be done,  and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,  proper or
advisable to fulfill all  conditions  applicable to such party  pursuant to
this  Agreement  and  to  consummate  and  make  effective,   in  the  most
expeditious  manner  practicable,  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement and the Protocol (including the Distribution),  including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary  actions or  nonactions,  waivers,  consents and
approvals  from  Governmental  Entities  and the  making  of all  necessary
registrations  and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval,  waiver or exemption from any Governmental
Entity; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals, waivers or
exemptions from non-governmental third parties; and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional documents or instruments necessary to consummate
the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and the  Protocol.  In
addition,  each  of the  parties  hereto  agrees  to use  its  commercially
reasonable  efforts to defend any  lawsuits or legal  proceedings,  whether
judicial  or   administrative,   challenging  the  Purchase  or  the  other
transactions  contemplated  hereby.  Target also shall  cooperate  with any
reasonable   request  of   Purchasers  to   consummate   the   transactions
contemplated  hereby  (i)  through  a  conveyance  of other  equity or real
property  interests  of Target or a Target  Subsidiary  in order to acquire
indirectly  the  interests  identified  on  Exhibit  A hereto if and to the
extent  such  alternative   transaction   structure  would  facilitate  the
obtaining of any Necessary  Consent or render the obtaining of such consent
(or any other consent)  unnecessary  and/or (ii) in a tax efficient manner,
including,  without limitation,  where necessary to avoid Dutch withholding
taxes or, when  requested,  the termination of  partnerships,  including an
admission  by  contribution  to  certain  partnerships  of  the  Purchasers
immediately  prior to Closing (with a right to redeem such  contribution if
the Closing does not occur  immediately  thereafter),  and, if requested by
Purchasers  deferred and reverse like kind  exchanges  resulting in cash to
the seller of the asset, which in no event shall reduce the Purchase Price.
Purchasers  shall  cooperate  with any  reasonable  request  by  Target  to
consummate  the  Purchase  through the  conveyance  of other equity or real
property  interests  of Target or a Target  Subsidiary  in order to acquire
indirectly the interests specifically identified on Exhibit A hereto if and
to the extent such alternative  transaction  structure would facilitate the
obtaining of any Necessary  Consent or render the obtaining of such consent
(or  any  other  consent)  unnecessary,   provided  that  such  alternative
transaction  structure would not (i) diminish the economic  benefits to the
Purchasers  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  (ii)  impose  any
material  limitations  or  burdens  on any  Purchaser's  (or any  Purchaser
Designee's)  ownership or operation of any Assets or (iii) adversely affect
either  the tax  consequences  that any  Purchaser  Party  would  have from
acquiring  the  interests  specifically  identified on Exhibit A or the tax
treatment of the Purchaser Parties.

          (b) Target  shall give  prompt  notice to  Purchasers  of (i) the
occurrence,   or  non-occurrence   of  any  event  whose   occurrence,   or
non-occurrence  would be likely to cause any  condition set forth herein to
be unsatisfied in any material  respect at any time from the date hereof to
the  Closing  and  (ii)  any  failure  of  Target  or any of its  officers,
directors,  employees or agents to comply in any material  respect with any
covenant  or  agreement  to be  complied  with by it  hereunder;  provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall
not  limit  or  otherwise  affect  the  remedies  available   hereunder  to
Purchasers.

     SECTION 5.5. Tax Returns. Target and Purchasers shall cooperate in the
preparation,   execution   and  filing  of  all  returns,   questionnaires,
applications  or other  documents  regarding  any  Transfer and Gains Taxes
applicable to the Purchase.  Target hereby assumes full  responsibility for
preparation  and filing,  at Purchasers'  sole expense,  all Tax Returns of
each Target  Non-Purchased  Entity with respect to all Assumed  Taxes which
are required to be filed on or after the Closing Date.  Purchasers shall be
given thirty (30) days to comment on such Tax Returns prior to their filing
and the returns shall be subject to the approval of  Purchasers,  not to be
unreasonably withheld.

     SECTION  5.6.  Section  754 or  Other  Elections.  At the  request  of
Purchasers,  with respect to any  partnership in which a Target  Subsidiary
has a direct  or  indirect  interest  that has not made an  election  under
Section  754 of the Code (a  "Section  754  Election")  or other  election,
Purchasers and Target shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause each
such partnership as designated by Purchasers to file a Section 754 Election
with the  partnership's  federal  income Tax Return for the taxable year of
the partnership that ends on or includes the Closing Date or make any other
tax  elections  under the Code.  At the request of  Purchasers,  Target and
Target  Subsidiaries  will  cooperate  in  making  elective  classification
elections  with respect to any Target  Subsidiary  under the pertinent U.S.
Treasury regulations.

     SECTION 5.7.   Employee Arrangements.

          (a)  Employment  and  Change of Control  Arrangements.  As of the
Closing  Date,  the Parent  Entities  shall  assume,  honor and  perform in
accordance  with their terms all employment,  severance,  change of control
and other such agreements of Target and any Target Subsidiary identified in
Section  5.7(a) of the  Target  Disclosure  Letter.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing,  the Parent Entities shall pay or cause to be paid at Closing to
the  employees  identified on Section 5.7 of the Target  Disclosure  Letter
(the "Key Employees") the amounts due to each such Key Employee pursuant to
the terms of each such Key Employee's employment agreement,  an estimate of
each such  amount  is set forth on  Section  5.7 of the  Target  Disclosure
Letter.  The Parent Entities  further agree that all Non-Covered  Employees
who are terminated without cause within twelve months following the Closing
Date and who execute a general release of claims in a form  satisfactory to
the Parent  Entities  shall be entitled to receive  severance  compensation
equal to the greater of  (subject  to the proviso set forth  below) (i) two
weeks of such  employee's base salary and (ii) the greater of (A) two weeks
of such employee's base salary (the "Severance Base") for each full year of
combined   service  with  Target,  a  Target   Subsidiary   (including  any
predecessor  thereof) and the Parent  Entities and, for any partial year of
such service, a pro rata amount of such employee's  Severance Base based on
the number of whole  months  elapsed in such  partial year divided by 12 or
(B) in the event  that the  Non-Covered  Employee  has at least 15 years of
such service, one year of such employee's base salary;  provided,  however,
that under no  circumstances  will such  employee  be  entitled  to receive
greater  than one  year of such  employee's  base  salary  (the  "Severance
Payment").  It is  understood  and  agreed  that the  Severance  Payment to
Non-Covered  Employees  and the  payments to the  employees  identified  on
Section 5.7 of the Target  Disclosure  Letter shall be in lieu of any other
severance  benefits  (except as required by  applicable  law) that any such
employee is entitled to receive and will be applied  against any  liability
of the Parent  Entities  which may arise  under the Worker  Adjustment  and
Retaining  Notification Act ("WARN"). If the Parent Entities determine that
liability  under WARN could arise as a result of  employment  terminations,
Target will  cooperate  reasonably  with the Parent  Entities in connection
with the  delivery  of WARN  notices  to  affected  employees  prior to the
Closing Date.

          (b) Benefit Plans.  Upon and after the Closing Date,  each Parent
Entity shall allow employees of Target who become  employees of such Parent
Entity to participate in employee benefit plans of such Parent Entity which
are made available generally to similarly situated employees of such Parent
Entity.  With respect to any such plan which is an "employee  benefit plan"
as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other  service  based  benefits
(including  vacations)  in which the  employees of Target may  participate,
solely for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,  vesting and
entitlement to benefits but not for purposes of accrual of benefits (except
in the case of accrued  vacation,  sick or  personal  time),  service  with
Target or any Target  Subsidiary  shall be  treated  as  service  with such
Parent Entity; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized
to the  extent  that such  recognition  would  result in a  duplication  of
benefits  under both a Target  Employee  Benefit Plan and a benefit plan of
such Parent Entity (or is not otherwise  recognized for such purposes under
the benefit plans of such Parent Entity).  Without  limiting the foregoing,
the Parent Entities shall not treat any Target employee as a "new" employee
for purposes of any  pre-existing  condition  exclusions,  waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or similar provision under any health
or other  welfare plan,  and will make  appropriate  arrangements  with its
insurance carrier(s), to the extent applicable, to ensure such result.

          (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Parent Entities,
Target or any Target  Subsidiary  from  terminating  the  employment of any
employee of Target or any Target  Subsidiaries  at any time on or after the
Closing Date.

          (d) Prior to the  Closing  Date,  Target  will  take all  actions
necessary to:

               (i) cause each outstanding stock  appreciation right ("SAR")
     granted  under the Urban  Shopping  Centers  2001  Stock  Appreciation
     Rights Plan (the "2001 SAR Plan") to be cancelled on the Closing Date,
     and in full  satisfaction  of such  cancellation  each holder  thereof
     shall be  entitled to receive on the Closing  Date in  exchange,  with
     respect to each SAR,  an amount  equal to the Per Share  Consideration
     less the Exercise  Price (as defined in the 2001 SAR Plan)  multiplied
     by the number of  Covered  Shares  (as  defined  in the SAR  Agreement
     evidencing the SAR) to which such SAR relates;

               (ii)  cause all  Restricted  Stock (as that term is  defined
     under the Urban  Shopping  Centers 2001  Incentive  Program (the "2001
     Incentive  Program"))  granted  under the 2001  Incentive  Program (it
     being  acknowledged by the parties that the transactions  contemplated
     by  this  Agreement  shall  cause  all  Restricted   Stock  to  become
     immediately  vested in full) to be cancelled on the Closing Date,  and
     in full satisfaction of such cancellation each holder thereof shall be
     entitled  to receive in exchange a cash  payment on the  Closing  Date
     equal  to  the  product  of  his or her  shares  of  Restricted  Stock
     multiplied by the Per Share Consideration;

               (iii) cause each outstanding share of Earned Incentive Stock
     (as that term is defined in the 2001 Incentive  Program) granted under
     the 2001 Incentive Program (it being  acknowledged by the parties that
     all shares of Incentive  Stock  eligible to be earned  during the 2001
     Program  Year  (as  provided  in  Section  4.1 of the  2001  Incentive
     Program) shall be deemed to be Earned Incentive Stock) to be cancelled
     on the Closing Date,  and in full  satisfaction  of such  cancellation
     each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a cash payment on the
     Closing  Date  equal to the  product  of his or her  shares  of Earned
     Incentive Stock multiplied by the Per Share Consideration;

               (iv)  cause all  Incentive  Stock  (as such term is  defined
     under the 2001  Incentive  Program)  granted under the 2001  Incentive
     Program  that is not Earned  Incentive  Stock (i.e.,  Incentive  Stock
     eligible to earned in the 2002, 2003 and 2004 Program Years) or deemed
     to be Earned  Incentive  Stock for  purposes of this  Agreement  to be
     forfeited on the Closing Date; and

               (v) cause  each of the 2001 SAR Plan and the 2001  Incentive
     Plan to be terminated.

     SECTION 5.8. No  Solicitation of Acquisition  Proposals.  Target shall
not,  and it shall  cause its  Subsidiaries  and the  officers,  directors,
employees,  agents  and  representatives  of  Target  and its  Subsidiaries
(collectively,  the  "Target  Representatives")  not  to,  (i)  solicit  or
encourage,  directly or indirectly, the making of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) initiate any discussion or engage in negotiations  with or provide any
information to any entity relating to an Acquisition  Proposal, or take any
other  action to  knowingly  facilitate  the  making of any  proposal  that
constitutes,  or may  reasonably  be expected  to lead to, any  Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) endorse or enter into any Acquisition Proposal or modify
or withdraw  its  recommendation  of the  Purchase.  Except as permitted by
Section 5.8 hereof, Target and the Target  Representatives will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated  any existing  activities,  discussions or
negotiations  with any Third Parties  conducted  heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Target may engage
in discussions or provide  information  with respect to an unsolicited bona
fide written  Acquisition  Proposal if (i) Target and the Supervisory Board
of  Target  conclude  in good  faith  that  such  Acquisition  Proposal  is
reasonably  likely  to  result  in  a  Superior  Proposal  (as  hereinafter
defined),  (ii)  prior  to  providing  any  information  to any  Person  in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, Target receives
from  such  Person  an   executed   confidentiality   agreement   on  terms
substantially similar to, and no less restrictive to such Person than those
contained  in the  Hoosier  Confidentiality  Agreement  and (iii)  prior to
providing any information to any Person or entering into  discussions  with
any  Person,  Target  notifies  Purchasers  promptly  of  such  Acquisition
Proposal  or  negotiations,  including  the  name  of such  Person  and the
material terms and  conditions of such  Acquisition  Proposal  (including a
copy of any written proposal and any written  documentation).  Target shall
notify  Purchasers  promptly,  but in any event  within  24  hours,  of any
Acquisition  Proposal  or  any  inquiry  with  respect  to or  which  could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition  Proposal  received by any
Target or the  Target  Representatives,  the terms and  conditions  of such
proposal  (including  a copy  of  any  written  proposal  and  any  written
documentation)  and the identity of the Person making the proposal or offer
or inquiry.  Target will promptly notify  Purchasers of any material change
in the status and  details of any such  Acquisition  Proposal  or  inquiry.
Target will  promptly  provide to  Purchasers  any  non-public  information
concerning  Target or its  Subsidiaries  provided to any other Person which
was not  previously  provided to  Purchasers.  In addition,  Target and the
Supervisory Board of Target may withdraw or modify their  recommendation of
the  Purchase or approve a Superior  Proposal  and enter into an  agreement
with respect thereto if (x) a Superior Proposal is pending,  (y) Target has
provided  Purchasers  with notice that it has received a Superior  Proposal
which it intends to accept  (specifying  the offeror and the material terms
and conditions of such Superior  Proposal) and (if requested by Purchasers)
has negotiated in good faith with Purchasers  during the three (3) Business
Days following  Purchasers'  receipt of such notice to attempt to make such
adjustments  to this  Agreement as would enable  Target and  Purchasers  to
proceed with the Purchase on such adjusted  terms and (z) this Agreement is
terminated in connection  with such Superior  Proposal and the Break-Up Fee
is  paid.  "Superior  Proposal"  means an  unsolicited  bona  fide  written
proposal by a Third Party to acquire all or substantially all of the Assets
(i) on terms which the  Supervisory  Board  determines in good faith (after
consultation  with its  financial  advisors  and legal  counsel) to be more
favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders of Target than
the terms  contemplated  by this Agreement,  (ii) is not  conditioned  upon
obtaining  financing  not fully  committed  at such time and (iii) which is
reasonably  capable of being  consummated  without  undue delay in the good
faith judgment of the Supervisory Board of Target.  "Acquisition  Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether in writing or otherwise, from
a Third Party to acquire  beneficial  ownership  of all or more than 20% of
the assets of Target and the Target Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or 20%
or more of any  class of  equity  securities  of  Target  or of any  Target
Subsidiary which owns, directly or indirectly,  more than 50% of the Assets
pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination,  sale of
shares of capital stock,  sale of assets,  tender offer,  exchange offer or
similar  transaction  with  respect  to either  Target  or any such  Target
Subsidiary,  including  any single or multi-step  transaction  or series of
related  transactions,  which is  structured  to permit such Third Party to
acquire  beneficial  ownership of more than 20% of the assets of Target and
the Target  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of
equity securities of Target or any Target  Subsidiary which owns,  directly
or indirectly, more than 50% of the Assets.

     SECTION 5.9. Public  Announcements.  Target,  on the one hand, and the
Purchaser Parties, collectively, on the other hand, shall consult with each
other before  issuing any press  release with respect to this  Agreement or
any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue
any such press  release  without  having first  provided a copy of any such
press release to Target, on the one hand, or the Purchaser Parties,  on the
other hand, as the case may be.

     SECTION 5.10. Agreements Regarding the Disposal of Properties.  At the
direction  of  Purchasers,   Target  shall  cause  each  applicable  Target
Subsidiary  to enter into an agreement,  in form and  substance  reasonably
acceptable  to  Purchasers  (each a  "Disposal  Agreement"),  to  sell  the
properties identified in Section 5.10 of the Target Disclosure Letter (each
a  "Disposal  Property")  to one or more  parties as may be  designated  by
Purchasers.  Under each such Disposal  Agreement,  the sale of the Disposal
Property  will be scheduled to close (with "time being of the essence" with
respect to such  closing)  prior to the Closing of the  Purchase or at such
date after the Closing as Purchasers  may agree.  Target  shall,  and shall
cause the applicable  Target  Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable
best efforts to consummate the sale of each Disposal Property in accordance
with  the  terms  and  conditions  of the  applicable  Disposal  Agreement;
provided,  however,  that  the  proceeds  received  by  Target  or a Target
Subsidiary in  consideration  for the disposition of any Disposal  Property
(i) shall not be less than the  minimum  price set forth for such  Disposal
Property in Section 5.10 of the Target  Disclosure Letter and (ii) shall be
used by Target to pay existing indebtedness;  and provided,  further, that,
with respect to the 745  Property,  such Disposal  Agreement  shall provide
that (i) such  applicable  Target  Subsidiary  shall  not be  obligated  to
consummate  such sale unless the Purchase will be  consummated  immediately
thereafter and (ii) in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article VIII such Target  Subsidiary shall have the right to terminate
such Disposal  Agreement  without any cost,  penalty or liability  thereto.
Target shall cooperate with Purchasers in the negotiation and  consummation
of any Disposal  Agreement,  including,  without  limitation,  granting any
potential buyer  permission to conduct usual and customary due diligence in
connection with such sale. Each applicable  Target  Subsidiary  shall enter
into any  Disposal  Agreement  as  Purchasers  shall in good faith  direct.
Purchasers  shall  indemnify  and hold  the  applicable  Target  Subsidiary
harmless from any liability in connection with any such Disposal Agreement.
Neither  Target  nor any  Target  Subsidiary  shall  take any  action it is
entitled to take under,  or relating to, any such  Disposal  Agreement,  or
exercise any remedy in connection with any such Disposal Agreement, without
the prior  written  consent of  Purchasers  and,  upon the  instruction  of
Purchasers,  Target  and any Target  Subsidiary  shall  promptly  take such
action  and/or  exercise any remedy in  connection  with any such  Disposal
Agreement as Purchasers  shall direct  (provided that such action or remedy
is permitted or provided for under the applicable Disposal  Agreement).  At
the closing of the transaction contemplated by a Disposal Agreement, Target
and any Target  Subsidiary  shall deliver to the purchaser  thereunder  all
documents,  agreements,  instruments  and Necessary  Consents  described in
Section 2.5 which are applicable thereto  (including,  without  limitation,
instruments  sufficient  to convey the Target  Tangible  Personal  Property
associated with such Target Property).

     SECTION 5.11.  Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

          (a) It is understood and agreed that,  subject to the limitations
on  indemnification   under  applicable  law,  Hoosier  and  Terrapin  (the
"Indemnifying  Parties")  shall,  to the  fullest  extent  permitted  under
applicable  law,  indemnify  and hold  harmless,  for a period of six years
following the Closing,  (i) each present and former managing or supervisory
director,  officer  and  employee  of the Target or any  Target  Subsidiary
against  any costs or  expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,  liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement  in  connection  with any claim,  action,  suit,  proceeding  or
investigation  (collectively,  "Losses") arising out of any action taken or
omission  occurring  at or prior to the Closing  Date and (ii) each present
and former  managing or supervisory  director,  officer and employee of any
Target Non-Purchased Entity (together with the persons with indemnification
rights  pursuant  to  clause  (i)  above,  collectively,  the  "Indemnified
Parties")  against any Losses  arising out of his or her good faith actions
in  connection  with the  distribution  of the  Purchase  Price to Target's
shareholders  in accordance  with the terms and conditions of the Protocol;
provided,  that  the  Indemnifying  Parties  shall  not be  liable  for any
settlement  effected  without their prior written  consent  (which  consent
shall not be  unreasonably  withheld).  In  connection  therewith,  (A) the
Indemnifying  Parties  shall  promptly pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition  of any  claim,  suit,  proceeding  or  investigation  to  each
Indemnified  Party to the full  extent  permitted  by law,  subject  to the
provision by such  Indemnified  Party of an  undertaking  to reimburse  the
amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by
a court  of  competent  jurisdiction  that  such  Indemnified  Party is not
entitled to such amounts,  and (B) the  Indemnified  Parties may retain one
counsel  satisfactory  to them  (except in case of a conflict  of  interest
among two or more Indemnified  Parties, in which case more than one counsel
may be  retained),  and the  Indemnifying  Parties  shall  promptly pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the  Indemnified  Parties.
Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim  indemnification  under this Section
5.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, demand,  proceeding or
investigation,  shall notify the Indemnifying Parties;  provided,  that the
failure to so notify shall not affect the  obligations of the  Indemnifying
Parties except to the extent such failure to notify  materially  prejudices
such parties.

          (b) For a  period  of six  years  after  the  Closing  Date,  the
Indemnifying  Parties will maintain in effect the existing  directors'  and
officers'  liability  insurance  covering the  Indemnified  Parties who are
currently  covered by Target's  and the Target  Subsidiaries'  officers and
directors  liability insurance policies (copies of which policies have been
provided to Purchasers) on terms not less favorable than those in effect on
the date hereof in terms of coverage and amounts and which provide coverage
as to claims  arising  out of the good faith  actions  of such  Indemnified
Persons  in  connection  with the  distribution  of the  Purchase  Price to
Target's  shareholders  in accordance  with the terms and conditions of the
Protocol; provided, however, that if the aggregate annual premiums for such
insurance  at any time  during  such  period  exceed  the per annum rate of
premium paid by Target for such insurance as of the date of this Agreement,
then the Indemnifying  Parties shall provide the maximum coverage that will
then be available at an annual premium equal to 175% of such per annum rate
as of the date of this Agreement.

          (c) This Section 5.11 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of,
and to grant third party  rights to, the  Indemnified  Parties and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Indemnifying  Parties. Each of
the  Indemnified  Parties  shall  be  entitled  to  enforce  the  covenants
contained in this Section 5.11.

          (d) In the event that any of Purchasers or any of its  successors
or assigns (i) consolidates  with or merges into any other person or entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving  entity of such  consolidation
or merger or (ii)  transfers  or conveys a majority of its  properties  and
assets to any  person  or  entity,  then,  and in each  such  case,  proper
provision shall be made so that the successors,  assigns and transferees of
such  Indemnifying  Party assume the  obligations set forth in this Section
5.11.

          (e) To the extent permitted by law, all rights of indemnification
for the benefit of any  Indemnified  Party shall be  mandatory  rather than
permissive.

          (f) The liabilities and obligations  assumed by the  Indemnifying
Parties under this Section  5.11(a)-(e)  are referred to herein as the "H&T
Assumed Liabilities". Following the Closing, Purchasers shall indemnify and
hold harmless each Target  Non-Purchased  Entity against any claims arising
in respect of the Non-Financial Covenants.

     SECTION 5.12.  Shareholders' Meeting

          (a) Target  shall as  promptly  as  practicable  duly call,  give
notice of and take all other action necessary in accordance with applicable
law to convene,  and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the  "Shareholders
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the  affirmative  vote of holders of
Ordinary Shares of Target casting at least two-thirds of the votes cast and
excluding  all Ordinary  Shares,  if any,  owned by the Voting Trust (i) to
approve the Purchase,  (ii) to approve the  Distribution,  conditioned only
upon the  Closing,  (iii) to appoint at Closing  one person  designated  by
Westfield  Limited (the "Westfield  Designee") to the Board of Liquidators,
provided  that  Target  shall  have the right to  object  to the  Westfield
Designee on a reasonable  basis,  provided,  further,  that if no Westfield
Designee is  appointed to the Board of  Liquidators  at Closing (due to the
failure of the  Westfield  Designee to obtain the required  approval of the
Dutch Central  Bank, as a result of the objection by Target or  otherwise),
the  Board  of  Liquidators  shall  consult  with  Westfield  Limited  on a
reasonable  basis  on  matters  related  to,  or in  connection  with,  the
Distribution,  provided,  further,  that  Target  shall have no  obligation
pursuant to this clause (iii) if  Westfield  Limited  transfers  all of its
equity  ownership in Target to an  unaffiliated  third  party,  and (iv) to
appoint the members of the Management Board as liquidators to carry out the
Distribution  in accordance  with the  Protocol,  and shall take all lawful
action to solicit  the  approval  of such  transactions  by such vote.  The
Management  Board and the Supervisory  Board of Target shall recommend that
holders of Ordinary  Shares vote in favor of such  resolutions.  Subject to
Section 5.8, the Supervisory Board shall not withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Purchasers its recommendation of the resolutions.  Target agrees
that it will not cancel,  postpone or adjourn the date of the  Shareholders
Meeting  or  change  the  items on the  agenda  without  the  agreement  of
Purchasers.

          (b) As promptly as reasonably  practicable after the date of this
Agreement,  Target shall  prepare a  shareholder  circular  relating to the
matters to be submitted to the  shareholders of Target at the  Shareholders
Meeting.  Target shall provide Purchasers with a reasonable  opportunity to
review and comment on the  shareholder  circular,  and on any  amendment or
supplement thereto, and shall not distribute the shareholder  circular,  or
any  amendment or  supplement  thereto,  to its  shareholders  prior to the
approval of such document by the  Purchasers,  which  approval shall not be
unreasonably  withheld or delayed. The shareholder circular shall comply as
to  form  in all  material  respects  with  the  applicable  provisions  of
applicable  law. Each Purchaser  shall furnish all  information  concerning
itself and its  Affiliates  which is required or  customary  for  inclusion
therein.  If at any time prior to the Shareholders  Meeting any information
relating to Target or Purchasers,  or any of their  respective  Affiliates,
officers or directors,  should be discovered by Target or Purchasers  which
should  be set  forth in an  amendment  or  supplement  to the  shareholder
circular so that such  document  would not include  any  misstatement  of a
material  fact or omit to state any  material  fact  necessary  to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they were
made, not  misleading,  the party which  discovers such  information  shall
promptly  notify the other party and, to the extent  required by law, rules
or  regulations,  an appropriate  amendment or supplement  describing  such
information  shall be promptly  and  disseminated  to the  shareholders  of
Target.

     SECTION 5.13. Voting Trust. Target hereby agrees to take all necessary
and appropriate actions to implement the Voting Trust Redemption at Closing
at a price not to exceed  (i) the  original  issue  price of such  Ordinary
Shares plus (ii) accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon  plus (iii)  related
financing and  administrative  costs in an amount not to exceed $7,500,000.
Target shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to procure that the
Agreement  Regarding the  Acquisition of Shares in Target,  dated September
23, 2001, be terminated  at Closing and  thereafter  shall be of no further
force and effect.

     SECTION 5.14.  Funding of Purchase  Price.  The Parent  Entities shall
cause the Purchasers to fulfill their  obligations  hereunder to consummate
the Purchase in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including  by funding the  Purchasers  with an amount of cash  necessary to
permit the payment of the Purchase  Price by the  Purchasers  at Closing in
accordance  with Article II hereof.  For  avoidance of doubt,  this Section
5.14 shall terminate as of the Closing.

     SECTION  5.15.  Officers and  Directors.  Upon the written  request of
Purchasers,  (i) Target shall cause any or all of the directors (or persons
occupying  similar  positions  in any  limited  liability  company or other
entity)  and/or  officers of each direct or indirect  wholly  owned  Target
Subsidiary  (excluding  any  Target  Non-Purchased  Entity) to resign or be
removed or, as to officers, to be terminated,  effective as of the Closing,
and (ii) if  Target  or any of its  affiliated  entities  has the  right to
appoint any director (or person occupying a similar position in any limited
liability  company  or  other  entity)  or  to  cause  the  resignation  or
termination of any officer of any other entity in which Target (directly or
indirectly)  owns an equity  interest  (excluding any Target  Non-Purchased
Entity),  Target shall cause, effective as of the Closing, such director to
resign or to be removed and/or such officer to resign or be terminated.

     SECTION  5.16.  Urban  Retail  Properties.  Target  shall  cause to be
delivered to Purchasers at Closing, directly or indirectly, all outstanding
equity  interests in Urban  Retail  Properties,  Co. Such equity  interests
shall be an Asset hereunder and shall be delivered to the Purchaser Parties
for no  additional  consideration  and shall be  obtained  by Target for no
consideration  other than the  cancellation of the promissory  note,  dated
November  8,  2000,  issued  by  Patrick  Hackett  in  favor  of Novi  Mall
Associates.

                                ARTICLE VI

     SECTION 6.1.  Assumption of Taxes.  Subject to Section 7.1, Purchasers
shall each assume joint and several  liability for all Taxes (whether fixed
or  contingent) of each Target  Non-Purchased  Entity  (including,  without
limitation,  any  liability  for  income  Taxes of any such  party  and any
liability for Transfer and Gains Taxes  resulting from the  consummation of
the  transactions  contemplated  by the Transaction  Documents  incurred or
payable on, before, or after the Closing Date  (collectively,  the "Assumed
Taxes"));  provided,  however,  that no  Purchaser  Party shall  assume (i)
liability  for any Taxes arising from any actions or omissions of Target or
the Target  Non-Purchased  Entities occurring after the Closing Date (other
than for taxes payable to any U.S. taxing  authority in connection with the
liquidation  of Hexalon),  (ii) any liability  that any such party may have
for  another  Person's  Taxes,  other  than the Urban  Tax  Indemnification
Agreement and the Tax Protection  Agreement(s) disclosed in Section 3.14(h)
of the Target  Disclosure  Letter,  or (iii) any Taxes imposed by any Dutch
Governmental  Entity in respect of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  the Protocol or arising  after the Closing  (collectively,  the
"Excluded Taxes").

     SECTION 6.2. Indemnification.  Purchasers shall on a joint and several
basis indemnify and hold harmless each Target  Non-Purchased Entity and any
shareholder,  director,  officer,  or  employee  of a Target Non  Purchased
Entity for all Assumed Taxes.

     SECTION  6.3. Tax  Contests.  Target  hereby  grants  Purchasers  full
authority to assume full and primary  responsibility  to contest,  at their
sole  discretion and expense,  any matter relating to the Assumed Taxes and
shall indemnify each Target  Non-Purchased  Entity,  and all  shareholders,
directors,  officers,  and employees of Target Non-Purchased  Entities from
any costs that such parties may incur in defending or participating in such
contests.

     SECTION 6.4. Tax Refunds.  Purchaser  shall be entitled to all refunds
for Assumed  Taxes  otherwise  payable to Target or a Target  Non-Purchased
Entity.

     SECTION 6.5. Withholding  Certificates.  Neither Purchasers nor any of
their  respective  agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Purchase  Price  otherwise  payable  pursuant to this  Agreement  to Target
and/or any Target Subsidiary and/or any Target Non-Subsidiary Entity and/or
any Target Non-Purchased Entity any amounts under Section 1445 of the Code;
provided,  however,  Target and/or any Target  Subsidiary and/or any Target
Non-Subsidiary  Entity  and/or any Target  Non-Purchased  Entity shall each
apply  for  and  obtain  a  reduced   withholding   certificate  under  the
appropriate  Treasury  Regulations  under Section 1445 of the Code from the
IRS on or before the Closing Date (including, without limitation, a reduced
withholding  certificate in connection with the liquidation of Hexalon) and
to the extent any of them  provides  Purchasers a notice that complies with
Treasury Regulation section 1.1445-1(c)(2)(i)(B),  Purchasers shall not pay
over the withheld amounts to the IRS but will contribute such amounts to an
escrow account established for the benefit of Purchasers in form reasonably
satisfactory to Purchasers,  including such terms as are necessary to allow
Hexalon to  maintain  its REIT status  during the term of the  escrow.  Any
amounts  paid in lieu of the amounts  withheld and paid to the IRS shall be
treated by the parties for all tax reporting purposes as paid to Target for
the Australian Interests. The Purchasers shall be entitled to claim refunds
in respect of any Taxes paid by Purchasers and such refunds shall belong to
Purchasers. Target shall cooperate, and Target shall cause the other Target
Non-Purchased  Entities to cooperate,  with  Purchasers in seeking any such
refunds.

accordance  with the Protocol,  will equal not less than the Target Minimum
Amount;  or (ii) accept such  termination  by giving  written notice to the

action  alleging any breach of such  representations  or warranties) or the
termination of this Agreement  pursuant to Section 8.1, as the case may be.
This  Section 9.1 shall not limit any  covenant or agreement of the parties
which by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing.

     SECTION 9.2.   Expenses.

          (a) Except as  otherwise  specified in this Section 9.2 or agreed
in writing  by the  parties,  all costs and  expenses,  including,  without
limitation,  fees and  disbursements  of counsel,  financial  advisors  and
accountants,   incurred  in   connection   with  this   Agreement  and  the
transactions  contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.

          (b) Target  agrees  that if this  Agreement  shall be  terminated
pursuant  to Section  8.1(b) or (e) or (h) or (k),  then Target will pay to
each Purchaser,  or to such party or parties as directed by such Purchaser,
a cash  amount in Euros  equal to the  Break-Up  Expenses  (as  hereinafter
defined) applicable to such Purchaser.  Target also agrees that (i) if this
Agreement  shall be terminated  pursuant to Section  8.1(j) and the closing
has not occurred prior to the Termination Date due to a failure to obtain a
Necessary  Consent  (provided  that  Purchasers  have complied with Section
5.4(a)),  then  Target  will  pay to each  Purchaser,  or to such  party or
parties as directed by such Purchaser,  a cash amount in Euros equal to the
Reduced  Break-Up  Expenses  applicable to such  Purchaser and (ii) if this
Agreement  shall be terminated  pursuant to Section  8.1(j) and the closing
has not occurred prior to the Termination  Date due to a failure to fulfill
Section  7.1(c)  (provided  that  Purchasers  have  complied  with  Section
5.4(a)),  then  Target  will  pay to each  Purchaser,  or to such  party or
parties as directed by such Purchaser,  a cash amount in Euros equal to the
Break-Up Expenses applicable to such Purchaser.  Target further agrees that
(i) if this  Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or (d), or
(ii) if (A) Purchasers or Target shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) (provided that the basis for such termination is the failure
of Target's shareholders to approve the Purchase) or Section 8.1(j) without
the Shareholders Meeting having occurred, (B) at any time after the date of
this  Agreement  and at or before the time of the event giving rise to such
termination  there  shall exist an  Acquisition  Proposal  with  respect to
Target, and (C) within 12 months of any such termination of this Agreement,
Target or any of its Subsidiaries  shall enter into a definitive  agreement
with any third party with respect to a Majority  Acquisition  Proposal or a
Majority  Acquisition  Proposal is  consummated,  then Target  shall pay to
Purchasers,  or as otherwise  directed by  Purchasers,  an  aggregate  cash
amount  in  Euros  equal  to the  Break-Up  Fee (as  hereinafter  defined);
provided,  however, that any such Break-Up Fee payable in connection with a
termination  pursuant to Section  8.1(j)  shall be reduced by the amount of
any prior  payment  of  Break-Up  Expenses  or Reduced  Break-Up  Expenses.
Payment  of any of such  amounts  by  Target,  and any  allocation  between
Purchasers of such amounts shall be made, as jointly directed by Purchasers
in writing, by prompt wire transfer of immediately  available funds, but in
no event later than the date of termination (or in the case of clause (ii),
if later, the date Target or its Subsidiary enters into such agreement with
respect to or  consummates  such  Majority  Acquisition  Proposal)  by wire
transfer of immediately  available funds. A "Majority Acquisition Proposal"
shall be an  Acquisition  Proposal  to acquire  at least a majority  of the
Assets,  whether  pursuant  to a merger,  consolidation  or other  business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer,
exchange offer or similar  transaction,  including any single or multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions.

          (c) For purposes of this  Agreement,  the "Break-Up Fee" shall be
an aggregate  amount  equal to 2% of the Purchase  Price (with the Purchase
Price  calculated  as if the Closing  Date had  occurred on the date of the
termination giving rise to Target's obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee).

          (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Break-Up Expenses" shall
be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the actual  out-of-pocket  expenses
of Purchasers and any of their respective Affiliates incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated  hereby  (including,
without limitation, all attorneys',  accountants',  investment bankers' and
financing  sources' fees and  expenses)  and (ii) 1% of the Purchase  Price
(with the Purchase Price  calculated as if the Closing Date had occurred on
the date of the termination  giving rise to Target's  obligation to pay the
Break-Up Expenses).  For purposes of this Agreement,  the "Reduced Break-Up
Expenses" shall mean the Break-Up Expenses, except that such expenses shall
be capped at 1/2% (rather than 1%) of the Purchase Price.

          (e) In the event that either  Purchaser  is required to file suit
to seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this Section 9.2, and
Purchasers prevail in such litigation,  Purchasers shall be entitled to all
expenses,  including attorneys' fees and expenses, which it has incurred in
enforcing its rights under this Section 9.2.

          (f)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
each Purchaser expressly  acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any
termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant to Section  8.1 in  circumstances
where the Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance  with Section  9.2(b),  the
payment  of the  Break-Up  Fee shall  constitute  liquidated  damages  with
respect to any claim for damages or any other  claim  which such  Purchaser
would  otherwise  be  entitled  to  assert  against  Target  or any  Target
Subsidiary  or any of their  respective  assets,  or  against  any of their
respective directors,  officers, employees, partners or stockholders,  with
respect  to  this  Agreement  and  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement and shall  constitute the sole and exclusive  remedy available to
such Purchaser. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in
light of the  difficulty  of  accurately  determining  actual  damages with
respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section  8.1  in  circumstances  where  the  Break-Up  Fee  is  payable  in
accordance with Section 9.2(b),  the right to payment under Section 9.2(b):
(i) constitutes a reasonable  estimate of the damages that will be suffered
by reason of any such  proposed  or actual  termination  of this  Agreement
pursuant  to  said  section,  and  (ii)  shall  be  in  full  and  complete
satisfaction  of any and all damages  arising as a result of the foregoing.
Except for  nonpayment  of the  amounts set forth in Section  9.2(b),  each
Purchaser  hereby agrees that,  upon any  termination  of this Agreement in
circumstances  where the  Break-Up  Fee is payable,  in no event shall such
Purchaser or its  affiliated  Parent Entity (A) seek to obtain any recovery
or  judgment  against  Target  or any  Target  Subsidiary  or any of  their
respective assets, or against any of their respective directors,  officers,
employees,  partners or stockholders,  or (B) be entitled to seek or obtain
any  other   damages   of  any   kind,   including,   without   limitation,
consequential, indirect or punitive damages.

          (g) In the event that any Dutch court,  including the  Enterprise
Chamber  determines  that  any term or  provision  of  Section  5.8 or this
Section 9.2 is  unenforceable or unreasonable as a matter of Law, such term
or provision shall automatically be modified to the extent such Dutch court
determines  necessary to conform to applicable Law, and this Agreement and,
as applicable,  the Protocol,  as so modified,  shall thereafter  remain in
full force and effect.  The parties hereto agree that,  upon the occurrence
of such an event as described in the immediately  preceding  sentence,  (i)
the  Dutch  court  shall  have the  power to reduce  the  amount,  scope or
magnitude  of any such  term or  provision,  to  delete  specific  words or
phrases  from  such  term  or  provision,  or to  replace  any  invalid  or
unenforceable  term or  provision  so  implicated  with a modified  term or
provision  that  is  valid  and  enforceable  and  that  comes  closest  to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
(ii) the parties  hereto shall  request that the Dutch court  exercise that
power and (iii)  thereafter  this  Agreement  (and the  Protocol)  shall be
enforceable  as so modified  after the  expiration of the time within which
the judgment or decision may be applied.

          (h) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  in no event shall the amount
paid to any of the  Purchasers  pursuant to this  Agreement in any tax year
exceed the maximum  amount that can be paid to such  Purchaser in such year
without  causing any REIT with which it is  affiliated  to fail to meet the
REIT  requirements  for such  year,  determined  as if the  payment of such
amount did not  constitute  Qualifying  Income as determined by independent
accountants to such Purchaser. If the amount payable for any tax year under
the preceding sentence is less that the amount which Target would otherwise
be obligated to pay to the applicable  Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
(the "Expense  Amount"),  such Purchaser shall so notify Target, and Target
shall (at such  Purchaser's  sole  cost and  expense)  place the  remaining
portion  of the  Expense  Amount  in  escrow  and  shall  not  execute  any
instrumentation  permitting  any  release  of any  portion  thereof  to the
applicable Purchaser, and the applicable Purchaser shall not be entitled to
any such amount,  unless and until Target and escrow holder receive (all at
the applicable  Purchaser's  sole cost and expense)  notice from applicable
Purchaser,   together  with  either  (i)  an  opinion  of  the   applicable
Purchaser's  tax  counsel to the  effect  that such  amount,  if and to the
extent paid,  would not  constitute  gross  income which is not  Qualifying
Income  or  (ii) a  letter  from  the  applicable  Purchaser's  independent
accountants  indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to
the Purchasers (determined as if such payment did not constitute Qualifying
Income)  without  causing any REIT with which it is  affiliated  to fail to
meet the REIT  requirements  for any relevant  taxable year,  together with
either an IRS Ruling issued to such REIT or an opinion of such  Purchaser's
tax  counsel  to the  effect  that such  payment  would not be  treated  as
includible  in the income of such REIT for any prior taxable year, in which
event  escrow  holder shall pay such  maximum  amount.  Target's and escrow
holder's  obligation to pay any unpaid  portion of the Expense Amount shall
terminate  ten (10)  years from the date of this  Agreement,  and upon such
date, escrow holder shall remit any remaining funds in escrow to Target and
Target   shall   have  no   obligation   to  make  any   further   payments
notwithstanding that the entire Expense Amount has not been paid as of such
date.  For  purposes  of the  foregoing,  Qualifying  Income  shall  income
qualifying within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) of the Code.

     SECTION 9.3. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications  hereunder  shall be in  writing  and shall be given or made
(and  shall be  deemed to have been  duly  given or made upon  receipt)  by

     SECTION  9.4.  WAIVER  OF  JURY  TRIAL.  TO THE  EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL  PROCEEDING  ARISING  OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

     SECTION 9.5.  Headings.  The  descriptive  headings  contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     SECTION  9.6.  Severability.  If any term or other  provision  of this
Agreement is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public  policy,  all other terms and  provisions  of this  Agreement  shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect (i) so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions  contemplated hereby is not affected in
any  manner  materially  adverse  to any party or (ii) in  accordance  with
Section 9.2(g). Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2(g) hereof, upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,  illegal or
incapable of being  enforced,  the parties  hereto shall  negotiate in good
faith to modify this  Agreement so as to effect the original  intent of the
parties as closely as  possible in an  acceptable  manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible.

     SECTION 9.7.  Assignment.  The provisions of this  Agreement  shall be
binding  upon and inure to the  benefit  of the  parties  hereto  and their
respective  successors and assigns;  provided,  that neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights,  interests or obligations  hereunder may be assigned
(whether by  operation  of Law or  otherwise)  without the express  written
consent  of the other  parties  hereto  (which  consent  may be  granted or
withheld  in the sole  discretion  of the party  from whom such  consent is
requested)  except that  Purchasers  (or any Purchaser) may assign their or
its rights,  but not their or its respective  obligations (other than their
respective  obligations to purchase the Assets),  to any Purchaser Designee
or Affiliate of either Purchaser  without the consent of Target;  provided,
further,   that  no  such  assignment  shall  relieve  Purchasers  (or  any
Purchaser) of any liability or obligation under this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.8.  Entire  Agreement;  No Third-Party  Beneficiaries.  This
Agreement  and  the  Confidentiality   Agreements   constitute  the  entire
agreement and  supersede  all prior  agreements  and  understandings,  both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this  Agreement,  and,  except for the  Protocol and the Voting and Support
Agreement,  there are no other or additional  agreements between Purchasers
or any of their Affiliates,  on the one hand, Target and its Affiliates, on
the other hand,  relating to,  arising  from or  otherwise  entered into in
connection with this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.
Except for the  provisions of Section  5.11(a)-(e),  this  Agreement is not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or  remedies.  In the event of any  conflict or  inconsistency  between the
terms of this Agreement and the Protocol,  the parties agree that the terms
of this Agreement shall control.

     SECTION 9.9. Amendment.  This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by an instrument  in writing  signed by, or on behalf of, Target and
each Purchaser Party.

     SECTION 9.10.  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, applicable
to contracts  executed in and to be performed  entirely  within that state,
without regard to conflicts of law principles.  All actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement  shall be heard and determined
in any New York state or federal court sitting in the City of New York.

     SECTION 9.11.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or
more  counterparts,  and  by  the  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but  all of  which  taken  together  shall  constitute  one  and  the  same
agreement.

     SECTION  9.12.  Waiver.  Target,  on the  one  hand,  and  Purchasers,
collectively on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the  obligations or other acts of the other party,  (b) waive any
inaccuracies  in the  representations  and  warranties  of the other  party
contained  herein or in any document  delivered by the other party pursuant
hereto or (c) waive  compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other party  contained  herein.  Any such  extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing  signed by the party to
be  bound  thereby.  Any  waiver  of any  term or  condition  shall  not be
construed as a waiver of any  subsequent  breach or a subsequent  waiver of
the same term or condition,  or a waiver of any other term or condition, of
this  Agreement.  The  failure  of any  party to assert  any of its  rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

     SECTION 9.13. Reservation of Rights. If the Closing does not occur and
this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to the terms hereof, the Transaction
Documents and any other discussions,  negotiations or exchanges relating to
the  transactions  contemplated by the Transaction  Documents shall be with
full  reservation of rights and none of the  Transaction  Documents  (other
than the Confidentiality Agreements) or any such discussions,  negotiations
or exchanges shall be regarded as waiving any rights or claims of any party
thereto in any ruling, litigation or any future claims that are or could be
made  relating  to  the   transactions   contemplated  by  the  Transaction
Documents.

     SECTION 9.14.  Enforcement.

          (a) Target  acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled
to seek an injunction or  injunctions  to prevent any Purchaser  Party from
breaching  this  Agreement  or  to  enforce   specifically  the  terms  and
provisions of this  Agreement in any court  located  anywhere in the world.
Target agrees that the Purchaser Parties would suffer irreparable damage in
the event that any of the  provisions of this  Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise  breached.  It is
accordingly  agreed that the Purchasers  shall be entitled to an injunction
or  injunctions  to  prevent  breaches  of this  Agreement  and to  enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the
United  States  located  in the State of New York or in any New York  state
court,  this  being in  addition  to any  other  remedy  to which  they are
entitled at Law or in equity.

          (b) Each of the parties hereto  irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding  with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and
enforcement  of any judgment in respect  hereof  brought by the other party
hereto or its successors or assigns shall only be brought and determined in
any  federal  court  located in the State of New York or any New York state
court  sitting  in the City of New  York,  and each of the  parties  hereto
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect to its property,  generally and  unconditionally,  to
the exclusive  jurisdiction  of the aforesaid  courts.  Each of the parties
hereto  hereby  irrevocably  waives,  and agrees  not to assert,  by way of
motion,  as  a  defense,  counterclaim  or  otherwise,  in  any  action  or
proceeding  with  respect to this  Agreement,  (i) any claim that it is not
personally  subject to the  jurisdiction of the above-named  courts for any
reason  other than the  failure to serve  process in  accordance  with this
Section  9.13,  (ii) that it or its  property  is  exempt  or  immune  from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process  commenced in such
courts (whether  through service of notice,  attachment  prior to judgment,
attachment  in aid of  execution  of  judgment,  execution  of  judgment or
otherwise),  and (iii) to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable  law,
that (A) the suit,  action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient  forum,  (B) the venue of such suit,  action or  proceeding is
improper and (C) this Agreement,  or the subject matter hereof,  may not be
enforced  in or by such  courts.  Each of the parties  further  agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to such  party's  respective  address set forth  herein  shall be effective
service of process  for any  action,  suit or  proceeding  in New York with
respect to any matters to which it has  submitted  to  jurisdiction  as set
forth in this section.

     SECTION 9.15.  Exhibits;  Disclosure  Letter. All Exhibits referred to
herein and in the Target  Disclosure  Letter are  intended to be and hereby
are specifically made a part of this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.16. Joint and Several Obligations.  Subject to the following
proviso,  all  obligations of any Purchaser  Party hereunder shall be joint
and  several  obligations  of  all  of the  Purchasers  Parties;  provided,
however,  that (i) no obligation of a Purchaser under Section 2.3,  Section
5.11(f) or Article VI hereof shall be a joint and several obligation of any
Parent Entity and (ii) no  obligation of Hoosier or Terrapin  under Section
5.11(a)-(e)  shall be a joint and several  obligation  of Wallaby,  Wallaby
Acquisition Sub or any of Wallaby Acquisition Sub's Purchaser Designees.
