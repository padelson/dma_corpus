This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as
of July 10, 2017, is by and between Dynegy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Seller_ "), and Bruce Power, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Purchaser_ " and, together with the Seller, the " _Parties_ ").

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the Seller indirectly owns all of the issued and outstanding limited
liability company interests of Dynegy Gas Generation, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _DGG_ "), and DGG directly owns all of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company interests (collectively, the "
_Interests_ ") of Dynegy Lee II, LLC (the " _Acquired Company_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser
desires to purchase from the Seller, the Interests upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to the Seller to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Rockland Power Partners
III, LP, a Delaware limited partnership and a direct or indirect owner of the
Purchaser (" _Purchaser Parent_ "), has issued and delivered a guaranty, in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Purchaser Parent Guaranty_
"), in favor of the Seller with respect to the obligations of the Purchaser
arising under _Section 2.02(c)_, _Section 2.03_ and _Section 10.02(a)_.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE 1 _ 
Definitions and Rules of Construction_

 



 

SECTION 1.01 _Definitions_. Each capitalized term used in this Agreement has
the meaning given to it in _Exhibit A_.

 



 

SECTION 1.02 _Rules of Construction_.

 



 

(a) Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules shall be deemed references
to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to, this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Terms defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in the plural
and vice versa. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires
otherwise, words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and
neutral genders and vice versa. The terms "includes" and "including" shall
mean "including, without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein," "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
section or article in which such words appear.

      
 

 



 

(c) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. When calculating
the period of time before which, within which, or following which any action
must be taken hereunder, the date that is the reference date in calculating
such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is on a day that
is not a Business Day, then such action may be validly taken by the next day
that is a Business Day.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that each Party and its attorney has reviewed this
Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities
are to be resolved against the drafting Party, or any similar rule operating
against the drafter of an agreement, shall not be applicable to the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall
have the meanings given to them under GAAP.

 



 

(g) The dollar thresholds contained in _Article 9_, including the Deductible
and the Cap, are not an indication of materiality for any purposes under this
Agreement.

 



 

(h) All references to "dollars" or "$" shall be to U.S. dollars.

 



 

(i) References to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of
that Person.

 



 

(j) Prior drafts of this Agreement are not an indication of the PartiesÂ’
intent and shall not be applicable to the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 



 

(k) Any reference in this Agreement, the Schedules or any document delivered
in connection with this Agreement to any Law, Contract or document, or any
section thereof, shall, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
be a reference to such Law, Contract, document or section as amended, modified
or supplemented (including any successor section) and in effect from time to
time.

 



 

(l) An item arising with respect to a specific representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth in" a
balance sheet or a financial statement to the extent any such phrase appears
in such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement if such item and the
amount thereof is reasonably identified on such balance sheet or financial
statement (or the notes thereto).

 



 

(m) Delivery (or providing or making available) of any document or item to the
Purchaser shall be deemed to have occurred only if, prior to 9:00 a.m. central
time on July 10, 2017 (unless any delivery thereafter is expressly
acknowledged by any individual identified as a Knowledge party of the
Purchaser on _Exhibit A_ to the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule), such document
or item has been posted to the "Project LYNX" Intralinks data room maintained
by the Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a

 



      
 

 



 

folder thereof to which the Purchaser or its Representatives have downloading
and printing access.

 



 

ARTICLE 2 _ 
Purchase and Sale_

 



 

SECTION 2.01 _Purchase and Sale of Interests_. At the Closing, the Purchaser
shall purchase, and the Seller shall cause DGG to sell, the Interests, free
and clear of all Liens, in exchange for the Purchase Price.

 



 

SECTION 2.02 _Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the Interests is an amount in cash,
payable as provided in this _Section 2.02_ and _Section 2.05_, equal to the
sum of (i) One Hundred Eighty Million Dollars ($180,000,000) (the " _Base
Purchase Price_ "), _plus_ (ii) the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, _minus_ (iii) the PJM Incremental Capacity Adjustment
Amount (the amount calculated pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) and (iii),
the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 



 

(b) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall prepare and deliver, or shall cause to be prepared and delivered,
to the Purchaser a written notice setting forth (i) the Estimated Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, the Estimated PJM Incremental Capacity Adjustment
Amount and the Estimated Purchase Price, in each case, which shall be
calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions, including the
definitions, set forth in this Agreement, together with reasonable supporting
information and calculations, and (ii) the accounts to which the Estimated
Purchase Price should be delivered (clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Payment
Schedule_ ").

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller or its designees the
Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts set forth in the Payment Schedule.

 



 

(d) Any amount or adjustment taken into account in any component of the
Purchase Price shall not be taken into account in any other component of the
Purchase Price in a manner that would be duplicative.

 



 

SECTION 2.03 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Interests
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (a) at the offices of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 1000 Louisiana, Suite 6800, Houston, Texas 77002,
at 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time on the third (3rd) Business Day following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver of
such conditions) (such third (3rd) Business Day, the " _Closing Reference
Date_ "); _provided_ that the Purchaser shall be entitled to extend such date
up to seven (7) Business Days by delivering written notice of such extension
to the Seller prior to the Closing Reference Date, or (b) at such other time,
date and place as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties (the
date on which the Closing actually occurs being referred to as the " _Closing
Date_ "). The Closing shall be deemed effective for accounting purposes
(including for purposes of the adjustment in _Section 2.05(d)_) as of
12:00:01 a.m.

 



      
 

 



 

(Houston, Texas time) on the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 2.04 _Closing Deliveries_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Purchaser or its designees:

 



 

(i) certificates evidencing the Interests, duly endorsed in blank (or
membership interest powers in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Purchaser, duly executed by DGG);

 



 

(ii) a duly executed certificate pursuant to Section 1445(b)(2) of the Code,
providing that the Person treated as the owner of the assets of the Acquired
Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not a foreign person,
substantially in the form provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B) (the " _FIRPTA Certificate_ "); _provided_ , _however,_
that the PurchaserÂ’s sole right in the event that the Seller fails to deliver
such FIRPTA Certificate, or to cause such FIRPTA Certificate to be delivered,
pursuant to this _Section 2.04(a)(ii)_ shall be to make an appropriate
withholding in accordance with _Section 2.07_ to the extent required by
Section 1445 of the Code;

 



 

(iii) all books and records of, or primarily relating to, the Acquired
Company, to the extent such books and records are not physically located at
the Facility and are in possession of the Seller or its Affiliates; and

 



 

(iv) such other agreements, documents, instruments or writings as are required
to be delivered by the Seller at or prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section
7.02_ or as are otherwise reasonably required in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the Seller or its designees:

 



 

(i) the payment required by _Section 2.02(c)_; and

 



 

(ii) such other agreements, documents, instruments and writings as are
required to be delivered by the Purchaser at or prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to _Section 7.03_ or as are otherwise reasonably required in
connection with this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.05 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, the Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate with
each other and provide each other with such access to their respective books,
records and relevant employees (and those of the Acquired Company) as they may
reasonably request in connection with the matters addressed in this _Section
2.05_; _provided_ that no Party shall be obligated to deliver any accountant
work papers the delivery of which has not been consented to by such accounting
firm. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller a statement (the " _Purchaser Â’s
Statement_") setting forth (i) its calculation of the Purchase Price
(including the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, calculated
in a manner consistent with the Example Calculation, and the PJM

 



      
 

 



 

Incremental Capacity Adjustment Amount) prepared in a manner consistent with
the preparation of the Payment Schedule together with reasonable supporting
information and calculations and (ii) and the PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the
adjustment in _Section 2.05(d)_.

 



 

(b) The Seller shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which the
PurchaserÂ’s Statement is delivered to the Seller (the " _Review Period_ ") to
review the PurchaserÂ’s Statement. Unless the Seller delivers written notice to
the Purchaser on or before the last day of the Review Period that it objects
to any item or items shown or reflected on the PurchaserÂ’s Statement, and
specifying in reasonable detail the item or items to which it objects and
reasons therefor (such item or items, the " _Disputed Items_ " and such
notice, the " _Dispute Notice_ "), then the PurchaserÂ’s Statement shall be
deemed accepted by the Parties and the calculations set forth therein shall be
deemed accepted by the Purchaser and the Seller for all purposes of
determining the payments in _Section 2.05(d)_. In the event of a delivery of
a Dispute Notice by the Seller, senior executives of the Seller, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall attempt to resolve their
differences arising from any Disputed Items, and any resolution agreed by them
in writing shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of
determining the payments in _Section 2.05(d)_. In the event that, for any
reason, such senior executives are unable to amicably resolve all their
differences in writing within fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as the
Purchaser and the Seller may agree in writing) following the receipt of a
Dispute Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), any remaining Disputed Items not
agreed in writing shall be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (" _PWC_ ").
If PWC is unwilling or unable to serve as the Independent Accountant, each of
the Seller and the Purchaser will jointly select and retain a nationally
recognized accounting firm that is not the auditor or independent accounting
firm of any of the Parties who is a certified public accountant and is
independent of the Parties and impartial to serve as the Independent
Accountant (PWC or such other Person engaged to resolve any Disputed Items
pursuant to this _Section 2.05_, the " _Independent Accountant_ "). If after
fifteen (15) days after the date PWC informs the Parties that it is unable or
unwilling to serve as the Independent Accountant, the Seller and the Purchaser
cannot mutually agree on an Independent Accountant, either the Seller or the
Purchaser may request the American Arbitration Association to appoint as the
Independent Accountant, within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request
or as soon as practicable thereafter, a partner in a nationally recognized
accounting firm that is not the auditor or independent accounting firm of any
of the Parties, who is a certified public accountant and who is independent of
the Parties and impartial. If, for any reason, the Purchaser and the Seller
are unable to agree on the Disputed Items within the Resolution Period, each
of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, shall
prepare separate written reports of such Disputed Items and deliver such
reports to the Independent Accountant within twenty (20) days after the later
of the expiration of the Resolution Period and the date the Independent
Accountant is retained. The Parties shall use their respective reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to, acting as an expert, as soon
as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after receiving such
written reports, determine the manner in which the Disputed Items shall be
treated in the PurchaserÂ’s Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the dollar
amount of each item in dispute shall be determined within the range of dollar
amounts proposed by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the
other hand. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the review by and
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be limited to the unresolved
Disputed Items contained in the reports prepared and submitted to the
Independent Accountant by the Purchaser and the Seller and (ii) the
determinations by the Independent Accountant shall be based solely on such
reports submitted by the Purchaser and the

 



      
 

 



 

Seller and the basis for the PurchaserÂ’s and the SellerÂ’s respective
positions. The Parties shall not authorize the Independent Accountant to
modify or amend any term or provision of this Agreement or modify items
previously agreed among the Parties. The Purchaser and the Seller each agree
to enter into an engagement letter with the Independent Accountant containing
customary terms and conditions for this type of engagement. The Purchaser and
the Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
and provide information and documentation, including work papers, to assist
the Independent Accountant. Any such information or documentation provided by
any Party to the Independent Accountant shall be concurrently delivered to the
other Party, subject, in the case of independent accountant work papers, to
such other Party entering into a customary confidentiality and release
agreement with respect thereto. Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall
disclose to the Independent Accountant, and the Independent Accountant shall
not consider for any purposes, any settlement discussions or settlement offers
made by any of the Parties with respect to any Disputed Item. The
determinations by the Independent Accountant as to the Disputed Items shall be
in writing, shall include the Independent AccountantÂ’s basis for such
determinations and shall be an expert determination that is final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes of determining the adjustments in _Section
2.05(d)_, if any, and such determination may be entered and enforced in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each be
liable for and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by the
Independent Accountant.

 



 

(c) No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the
resolution of all Disputed Items (or, if there is no dispute, promptly after
the Parties reach agreement on the PurchaserÂ’s Statement), the Purchaser shall
revise the PurchaserÂ’s Statement to reflect the resolution of any Disputed
Items (as so revised, the " _Final Purchaser Â’s Statement_") and shall deliver
a copy thereof to the Seller. The Seller shall have five (5) Business Days
from the date on which the Final PurchaserÂ’s Statement is delivered to it to
review the Final PurchaserÂ’s Statement solely for purposes of confirming that
such statement accurately reflects the prior resolution of all matters set
forth in the Dispute Notice either by mutual agreement of the Parties or by
the Independent Accountant, as applicable; _provided_ that the Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted the Final PurchaserÂ’s Statement if the Seller does not
object within such five (5) Business Day period. The calculation of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final
PurchaserÂ’s Statement and the amount of any adjustment pursuant to _Section
2.05(d)_, once accepted by the Seller in the manner provided by the preceding
sentence, shall be referred to as the " _Final Statement_."

 



 

(d) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined as provided in _Section
2.05(b)_ and _Section 2.05(c)_ (as agreed between the Parties or as
determined by the Independent Accountant, as applicable, and reflected in the
Final Statement), (i) exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Purchaser
shall pay the Seller an amount equal to the amount of such excess, within five
(5) Business Days after such amounts are finally agreed or determined pursuant
to _Section 2.05(b)_ and _Section 2.05(c)_, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in the Payment Schedule, (ii) is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Seller shall pay the
Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of any such shortfall, within five (5)
Business Days after such amounts are finally agreed or determined pursuant to
_Section 2.05(b)_ and _Section 2.05(c)_, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Purchaser or (iii)
is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, then no payment shall be made
pursuant to this _Section 2.05_.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 2.06 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Within sixty (60) days after the
determination of the final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.05_, the
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a draft of a statement
setting forth a proposed allocation (the " _Allocation_ ") of the Purchase
Price (as well as Liabilities assumed or deemed assumed for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, to the extent relevant) among the assets of the Acquired
Company in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code, together with
reasonable supporting information and calculations. The Seller shall inform
the Purchaser in writing within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of such
draft of any objection by the Seller to the Allocation. To the extent that any
such objection is received, the Purchaser and the Seller shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any dispute within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of
such objection but shall have no obligation to resolve any disagreement. In
the event that the Purchaser and the Seller agree on the Allocation, the
Allocation shall be binding on the Purchaser and the Seller, who shall file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Allocation. If the Purchaser
and the Seller are unable to agree on the Allocation, each of the Purchaser
and the Seller shall be entitled to prepare its own allocation of the Purchase
Price (and liabilities assumed or deemed assumed for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, to the extent relevant) for purposes of filing its Tax Returns.

 



 

SECTION 2.07 _Withholding_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment hereunder to any recipient such amounts as are
required to be withheld under applicable Tax Law; _provided_ that the
Purchaser shall provide prior written notice to the recipient of any intention
to deduct or withhold from any payments with respect to such recipient and
shall permit such recipient to provide any applicable forms or other
information to eliminate or reduce any such deduction or withholding. Withheld
or deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholdings or
deductions were made.

Material Contract, and the Acquired Company has not received from, or given

any Contract with respect to Taxes, enter into any settlement or closing
agreement with respect to Taxes with any Taxing Authority, in each case, to
the extent such change, election, settlement, Contract or agreement could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a material adverse consequence to an
Indemnified Purchaser Entity;

 



 

(xvii) cause the Acquired Company to cease to be treated as a disregarded
entity for federal income tax purposes;

 



 

(xviii) make any changes in financial accounting methods, principles or
practices (or change an annual accounting period), except insofar as may be
required by a change in GAAP or applicable Law;

 



 

(xix) hire any employees;

 



 

(xx) establish any bank accounts; or

 



 

(xxi) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause (i) all Liabilities of the
Acquired Company under each Affiliate Obligation to be terminated, any amount
owed as a result of such termination to be discharged, and the Acquired
Company to have no further Liabilities thereunder and (ii) all Liabilities of
the Acquired Company to the Seller Parties and their Affiliates to be
terminated and discharged, in each case, to be effective as of the Closing. In
the event that, after the Closing, the Acquired Company has any Liabilities
under any Affiliate Obligation, upon the written request of the Purchaser, the
Seller shall promptly cause all such Liabilities to be terminated and
discharged, and the Acquired Company shall have no Liabilities as a result of
such termination or otherwise, irrespective of when such Liabilities arose.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.02(c)_ shall not apply to any
Contract entered into after the Closing or, if specified by the Purchaser
prior to Closing, any Contract entered into prior to the Closing as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, in either case, between the Acquired Company,
on the one hand, and any Seller Party or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.02_ is intended to give the
Purchaser the right to control or direct the operations of the Acquired
Company prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the
Acquired Company shall exercise complete control and supervision over the
Acquired CompanyÂ’s operations subject to the limitations in this _Section
6.02_.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 6.03 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_. The Seller shall be responsible for,
shall cause to be prepared and filed and shall pay all Taxes shown as due on,
all Tax Returns of the Acquired Company with respect to taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall
prepare all such Tax Returns in accordance with past practice (unless
otherwise required by applicable Law). The Seller shall submit any such Tax
Returns that will be filed after the date hereof to the Purchaser no later
than thirty (30) days (or in the case of sales Taxes, such shorter period as
is practicable, but in no event less than ten (10) days) prior to the due date
of such Tax Returns for the PurchaserÂ’s review and comment. The Seller shall
in good faith consider any comments of the Purchaser to such Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_. The Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall cause to
be prepared and filed, the Tax Returns of the Acquired Company with respect to
any Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall prepare
all such Tax Returns in accordance with past practice (unless otherwise
required by applicable Law). The Purchaser shall submit all such Tax Returns
to the Seller no later than thirty (30) days (or in the case of sales Taxes,
such shorter period as is practicable, but in no event less than ten (10)
days) prior to the due date of such Tax Returns for the SellerÂ’s review and
comment. The Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve
any disputes within ten (10) days following the delivery of such Tax Returns
to the Seller. If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to reach such
agreement within ten (10) days, any disputed items shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant and any determination by the Independent Accountant
shall be final; _provided_ that if any disputes between the Seller and the
Purchaser have not been resolved by the due date for filing a Tax Return
(giving effect to all available valid extensions), the Purchaser shall file
any such Tax Return in the manner prepared by the Purchaser, and the Tax
Return will be amended if and to the extent necessary to reflect the
resolution of any disputed items. Unless required by Law, the Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause the Acquired Company not to, amend any Tax Return
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Acquired Company. The Seller shall
pay to the Purchaser the portion of any Taxes shown as due on any Tax Return
prepared pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ that are allocable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period no less than five (5) days prior to the due date for the
filing of such Tax Return.

 



 

(c) _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. With respect to Taxes of or with
respect to, the Acquired Company relating to a Straddle Period, the Seller
shall be liable for the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the close of business on the Closing
Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on
the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based
upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on (and including) the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax
period and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant
Tax period ended on (and included) the Closing Date. For this purpose, any
franchise Tax paid or payable based solely on capital shall be allocated to
the taxable period for which payment of the Tax provides the right to engage
in business, regardless of the taxable

 



      
 

 



 

period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the
base of such Tax is measured. In determining whether a property Tax is
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period (or portion
thereof), any property Tax shall be deemed a property Tax attributable to the
taxable period specified on the relevant property Tax bill.

 



 

(d) _Tax Refunds_. Any refund, rebate, abatement, reduction or other recovery
(whether direct or indirect through a right of set-off or credit) of Taxes
(including any interest thereon) of the Acquired Company that is attributable
to a Pre-Closing Period (determined in accordance with the principles of
_Section 6.03(c)_) shall be the property of the Seller and shall be retained
by the Seller (or promptly paid by the Purchaser to the Seller if any such Tax
Refund is received by the Purchaser or the Acquired Company after the Closing
Date).

 



 

(e) _Cooperation_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate fully, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by any Party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns of the Acquired Company and any Tax contest or other
proceeding with respect to such Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon a PartyÂ’s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax contest or other
proceeding. The requesting Party shall reimburse the cooperating Parties for
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such cooperating Parties.

 



 

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser shall file all Tax Returns required to be
filed to report Transfer Taxes imposed on or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller and the Purchaser shall each be
responsible for the timely payment to and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the other Party from and against, 50% of all Transfer Taxes imposed
on or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify each other upon receipt by such Party of written notice of any
inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes
relating to taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date Pre-Closing
Tax Period for which the Seller may be liable under this Agreement (any such
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Seller Tax Matter_
").

 



 

(ii) The Seller shall have sole control of the conduct of all Seller Tax
Matters. The Purchaser may participate at its own expense with respect to any
Seller Tax Matter. If the Purchaser does not elect to participate in such
Seller Tax Matter, the Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed of all
developments on a timely basis and the Seller shall not resolve such Seller
Tax Matter in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on any Indemnified Purchaser Entity without the PurchaserÂ’s
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall not settle or compromise any Tax Claim
with respect to Straddle Period without SellerÂ’s prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(iii) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of

 



      
 

 



 

this _Section 6.03(g)_ and _Article 9_, the provisions of this _Section
6.03(g)_ shall govern.

 



 

SECTION 6.04 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that all information, documents and other
materials provided or made available to it in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
pursuant to _Section 6.01_, is Confidential Information subject to the terms
of the confidentiality and non-disclosure letter agreement, dated as of March
12, 2017, between the Seller and Rockland Capital, LLC (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate. If, for any reason, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) No Party or its respective Affiliates shall make any public announcement
or issue any public communication regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except any such announcement or communication (i) as may be required
by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable national
securities exchange ( _provided_ that such Party uses its commercially
reasonable efforts to coordinate or communicate such announcement or
communication with the other Party prior to announcement or issuance) or (ii)
is consistent with previous announcements or communications made jointly by
the Parties or other documents mutually approved by the Parties.

 



 

(c) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, the Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their Representatives to,
treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any
Person to) all confidential or proprietary information with respect to the
Facility, the Acquired Company and the business, assets and properties of the
Acquired Company (such information, the " _Facility Confidential Information_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Facility Confidential Information shall
not include any information that (i) was or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller, its Affiliates or its
or their Representatives in breach of this _Section 6.04(c)_, (ii) becomes
available to Seller, its Affiliates or its or their Representatives from a
source not known by Seller, its Affiliates or its or their Representatives to
be bound by an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information,
(iii) is independently developed by Seller, its Affiliates or its or their
Representatives without reference to or use of the Facility Confidential
Information or (iv) is approved for disclosure or release by the Purchaser in
writing. In the event that Seller, its Affiliates or its and their
Representatives are requested or required by law, rule, regulation,
governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory body or legal process (including
by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or other process) or in any legal,
judicial or regulatory proceeding or investigation to disclose any Facility
Confidential Information, the Seller will, to the extent reasonably
practicable and permitted by law, judicial or regulatory authority, give the
Purchaser prompt notice of such request so that the Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion and at its expense, seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy and/or take steps to resist or narrow the scope of the disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

sought by such request or requirement, and the Seller shall reasonably assist
the Purchaser, at the PurchaserÂ’s request and expense, in the PurchaserÂ’s
actions in this regard. It is further agreed that, if the Seller, its
Affiliates or its or their Representatives are nonetheless so required to
disclose any Facility Confidential Information, the Seller may, subject to any
protective order obtained by the Purchaser, disclose such information without
liability hereunder, provided that the Seller shall (i) furnish only that
portion of the Facility Confidential Information which, as advised by counsel,
is required to be disclosed, (ii) reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser (at
the PurchaserÂ’s request and expense) to the extent the Purchaser seeks to
limit such disclosure, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts (at the
PurchaserÂ’s request and expense) to ensure that confidential treatment will be
accorded to all such disclosed Facility Confidential Information.

 



 

SECTION 6.05 _Post-Closing Books and Records; Financial Statements_. For a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing, the Purchaser will give the
Seller, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives access to properties
transferred to the Purchaser, books and records transferred to the Purchaser
(even if such transferred books and records are or become commingled with
books and records of the Purchaser and its Affiliates) and personnel and
Representatives of the Acquired Company, as may be reasonably required by the
Seller, including for any legitimate business purpose or otherwise (a) to the
extent necessary for the preparation of financial statements, regulatory
filings or Tax Returns of the Seller or its Affiliates in respect of periods
ending on or prior to the Closing, (b) to the extent necessary for the Seller
or any of its Affiliates to comply with their respective obligations under
Section 6.2(d) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of August 21,
2014, by and among Duke Energy SAM, LLC, Duke Energy Commercial Enterprises,
Inc. and Dynegy Resource I, LLC, or (c) in connection with any insurance
claims, Tax audits, Claims or any obligations under this Agreement or any
agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be required to provide
any information (i) which the Purchaser reasonably believes it or the Acquired
Company is prohibited from providing to the Seller by reason of applicable
Law, which constitutes or allows access to information protected by
attorneyÂ—client privilege or which the Purchaser or the Acquired Company is
required to keep confidential or prevent access to by reason of any Contract
with a Third Party, or (ii) relating to pricing or other matters, in each
case, arising after the Closing and that are highly sensitive if the exchange
of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by the
PurchaserÂ’s counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for the
Purchaser or its Affiliates; _provided_ that the Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to disclose the information described in
clauses (i) and (ii) (or as much of such information as possible) in a manner
that does not violate applicable Law, result in the loss of attorneyÂ—client
privilege or violate any confidentiality restriction, and shall notify the
Seller of any information that it is not providing pursuant to the limitations
of this sentence. The Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives shall be entitled to make copies of and conduct searches with
respect to or in order to identify, the books and records to which such
Persons are entitled to access pursuant to this _Section 6.05_. Any such
access shall be conducted during regular business hours upon reasonable
advance notice and under reasonable circumstances, and shall be subject to
restrictions under applicable Law and any confidentiality obligations to which
the Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates are bound. The Purchaser agrees
that it shall preserve and keep the books and records held by Purchaser, the
Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates relating to the business of
the Acquired Company prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date. In the
event the Purchaser, the Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates
wishes to destroy any such books and records after that time, the Purchaser
shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the Seller and the
Seller shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written
notice given to the Purchaser within that ninety (90) day period, to take
possession of such books and records within one-hundred and eighty (180) days
after the date of such notice. In exercising its access rights with respect to
books and records pursuant to this _Section 6.05_, the Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
use reasonable care to preserve the condition of, and not to destroy or render
unusable in any manner, such books and records. The Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to (i) keep
all information and books and records accessed pursuant to this _Section
6.05_ confidential, (ii) not publicly disclose such information or books and
records to any other Person (except where such disclosure, upon the advice of
outside counsel, is required by applicable Law and only to the extent required
by applicable Law) and (iii) not use such information or books and records
other than for the express purposes set forth in the first sentence of this
_Section 6.05_. To the extent any books and records of, or relating to, the
Acquired Company were not physically located at the Facility or in the
possession of the Seller and its Affiliates and delivered to the Purchaser as
of the Closing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts from and
after the Closing Date to obtain such books and records and transfer them to
the Purchaser or its designee, at no cost to the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 6.06 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Closing takes place, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such costs and expenses, including any fees,
expenses or other payments incurred or owed by a Party to any brokers,
financial or legal advisors or comparable other persons retained or employed
by such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall be solely responsible,
and the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Company after the
Closing) shall have no liability, for any Transaction Expenses that are not
(a) paid by the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller at or prior to the
Closing or (b) reflected as a current liability in the calculation of the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

 



 

SECTION 6.07 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Offers_. Not later than ninety (90) days after the date of this
Agreement, the Purchaser, one of its Subsidiaries or a third-party operator
(each, a " _Purchaser Employer_ ") shall offer employment, commencing as of
the Closing Date, in the same position and on the terms set forth in _Section
6.07(b)_, to each Company Employee set forth in _Section 4.11(g)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits_. For a one (1) year period
following the Closing, provided that the Continuing Employee is employed by
the Purchaser Employer during such period, the Purchaser shall provide, or
shall cause the Purchaser Employer to provide, to each Continuing Employee (i)
an annual base salary opportunity that has a value no less than the annual
base salary provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits and incentive compensation that are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and incentive compensation
provided to similarly situated

 



      
 

 



 

employees of the Purchaser Employer.

 



 

(c) _Benefit Continuation Waivers for Continuing Employees_. The Purchaser
shall cause the Purchaser Employer to use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive or cause to be waived all limitations as to preexisting conditions or
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Continuing Employee under any employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of the Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof in which
Continuing Employees participate (or are eligible to participate) that are
"welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) to the same
extent that such conditions and waiting periods were satisfied or waived under
the comparable Seller Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing. In
addition, the Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Employer to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide or cause to be provided each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the plan year
commencing immediately prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
co-payments, deductibles or other out-of-pocket requirements under any such
comparable welfare benefit plans for such plan year.

 



 

(d) _Service Credit for Continuing Employees_. The Purchaser shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee credit for all service prior
to the Closing Date, to the same extent as such service was credited under the
comparable Seller Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, under all benefit plans
and arrangements and employment-related entitlements (including severance and
vacation/paid time-off policies) of the Purchaser or its Affiliates for all
purposes, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of
level of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that it results in the duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

 



 

(e) _401(k) Plan_. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall or
shall cause the Purchaser Employer to establish or maintain a defined
contribution plan and trust intended to qualify under Section 401(a) and
Section 501(a) of the Code and to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(k)
of the Code that shall accept a contribution in cash or, to the extent of any
promissory notes representing participant loans, in kind, attributable to any
eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) of the benefit of a Continuing Employee under any Seller Benefit
Plan that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(k) of the
Code; _provided_ that the obligation to accept such a rollover in kind shall
expire twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _Third-Party Rights_. The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ are for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee), other
than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Seller,
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment
or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) _Operator_. The Purchaser may elect to satisfy the requirements of this
_Section 6.07_ directly or by designating an Affiliate or third-party
operator to undertake the actions required hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 6.08 _Further Actions_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and without limiting any of the PartiesÂ’ obligations under this
_Section 6.08_, each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) In furtherance of, and without limiting the PartiesÂ’ obligations under,
_Section 6.08(a)_ or this _Section 6.08(b)_ or the PurchaserÂ’s obligations
under _Section 6.08(d)_, the Parties will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Required Consents, any approvals of parties to Contracts with the Acquired
Company and any Filings or Consents with or from any Governmental Entity,
including by (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable (and, in any
event, within thirty (30) Business Days following the date of this Agreement)
all necessary Filings required to be made with FERC under Section 203 of the
Federal Power Act (the initial application required to be made with FERC under
Section 203 of the Federal Power Act being referred to as the " _FERC
Application_ "), which shall be submitted to FERC in a form mutually
acceptable to the Parties, (ii) preparing and filing with FERC as promptly as
practicable (and, in any event, within thirty (30) Business Days following the
date of this Agreement) the informational filing pursuant to Schedule 2 to

acceptable to the Parties, (iii) preparing, filing and obtaining, as
applicable, as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, for the HSR Act,
within twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this Agreement) all
such other Filings or Consents with or from any Governmental Entity or other
Person that are required to be filed or obtained in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and requesting expedited treatment of such
Filings and Consents, (iv) assuring that all such Filings are in material

relevant Governmental Entity, (vi) subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keeping each other Party apprised
of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
Filings or other communications or correspondence between the Parties, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, and any Governmental Entity (or members of
their respective staffs) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (vii) responding to and complying with, as promptly as practicable, any
request for information or documentary material regarding the transactions

shall share equally any filing fees under the HSR Act, and the Seller shall
bear all fees associated with any

 



      
 

 



 

Filings or Consents with or from any other Third Party (including any
Governmental Entity) in connection with or otherwise related to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to communicating any information to
any Governmental Entity (or members of their respective staffs) in oral or
written form, each Party shall permit counsel for the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to review and provide comments thereon, and consider in good faith
the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed communication to
any Governmental Entity (or members of their respective staffs) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. Each of the Purchaser and the Seller agrees not
to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transaction
unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by applicable Law, gives the other
Party the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and
advisable under the circumstances.

 



 

(c) Neither Party shall, and each Party shall cause its Affiliates not to,
take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the approval of any Governmental Entity of any of the aforementioned
Filings or Consents or the timely receipt thereof, _provided_ , that the
Seller acknowledges and agrees, for all purposes of this Agreement, that the
existence of the matters set forth on _Section 6.08(b)_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, and actions taken in connection therewith (other than
actions related to or in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby), shall not be deemed to violate this _Section 6.08_;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.08_
shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives (other than the Acquired Company) from encouraging,
soliciting, participating in, initiating discussions or negotiations
regarding, providing information with respect to or engaging in any sale,
merger, combination, joint venture or other business combination transaction
of the Seller (" _Company Sale Activities_ ") that would not affect the
obligations of the Seller Parties (or their respective successors) to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of, and
without limiting the PartiesÂ’ obligations under _Section 6.08(a)_ and
_Section 6.08(b)_ each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
avoid or eliminate any impediment under any antitrust, competition, trade
regulation or other Law, and to obtain any Consent, including the Required
Consents, that is necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for Purchaser to own or operate the Acquired
Company and the Facility, that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
(including FERC) or any Third Party so as (i) to enable the Parties to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible and
(ii) to avoid any Claim by any Governmental Entity that would otherwise have
the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (A) to defend through litigation on the merits, including appeals, any
Claim asserted in any court or other proceeding by any Person that seeks to or
could prevent or prohibit or impede, interfere with or delay the Closing and
(B) to have vacated, lifted, dissolved, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect as part of any Claim and that prohibits, prevents
or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Purchaser be required (1) to propose,
negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of
the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Acquired Company or (2) to agree to any
limitation on the conduct of business of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the
Acquired Company (each, a " _FERC Mitigation Requirement_ "). Notwithstanding
any other

 



      
 

 



 

provision to the contrary, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to effect or
accept any FERC Mitigation Requirement and may elect to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(g)_ or, if the Outside Date has
occurred, _Section 10.01(b)_ in the event that FERC requires any FERC
Mitigation Requirements as a condition to granting the FERC Approval.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser further agrees that during the Interim Period, neither it
nor its Affiliates will enter into any other Contract to acquire electric
generation facilities or uncommitted generation capacity in the PJM market if
the proposed acquisition of such additional electric generation facilities or
uncommitted generation capacity in the PJM market would increase the market
power attributable to the Purchaser and its Affiliates in the PJM market in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to approval
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise prevent or
materially interfere with, or materially delay the consummation of the

transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 6.12 _Schedule Updates_. From time to time prior to the Closing, the
Seller may, at its option, deliver to the other Party supplements or
amendments to the Seller Disclosure Schedule solely with respect to any fact,
circumstance, development, event or occurrence first arising after the date of
this Agreement that would make any of the representations or warranties in
_Article 3_ or _Article 4_ inaccurate or incorrect (each, a " _Schedule
Update_ "). Subject to the rights of the Purchaser under _Section 10.01(e)_,
any such Schedule Update shall be deemed to have amended the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, and any fact, circumstance, development, event or occurrence
disclosed in such Schedule Update shall be deemed incorporated into the Seller

development, event or occurrence resulting from any actions permitted by or
taken in accordance with _Section 6.02_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement, and (b) any Schedule Update that reflects any fact,
circumstance, development, event or occurrence that does not give the
Purchaser a right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 10.01(e)_ shall
not be deemed incorporated into the Seller Disclosure Schedule for any
purposes hereof, including for purposes of _Article 7_, _Article 9_ and
_Article 10_, and the Purchaser shall retain all rights set forth herein with
respect to any such fact, circumstance, development, event or occurrence.

 



 

SECTION 6.13 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer and employee of the Acquired Company against Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by such person in connection with any Claim against such person
arising out of or pertaining to such personÂ’s capacity as a director, officer
or employee in respect of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the
fullest extent that the Acquired Company would have been permitted under
applicable Law and its Organizational Documents in effect on the date hereof
to indemnify such person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company (i) to maintain for
a period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing, provisions in its
Organizational Documents concerning the indemnification and exculpation
(including relating to expense advancement) of the Acquired CompanyÂ’s former
and current officers, directors, employees, parents and agents that are no
less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the Organizational
Documents of the Acquired Company, in each case, as of the date hereof and
(ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect
that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each
case, except as required by applicable Law. In addition, the Purchaser shall
cause the Acquired Company to pay any and all legal and other fees, costs and
expenses (including the cost of investigation and preparation) of any
indemnitee under this _Section 6.13_, as incurred and to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Company in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law
and the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Company in effect on the date
hereof. The Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid all fees, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that are incurred by an
indemnitee in enforcing this _Section 6.13_. The Purchaser shall assume, and
be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Acquired Company to
honor, each of the covenants in this _Section 6.13_.

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Acquired Company to, cause coverage to be extended under the directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance maintained, as of immediately prior to the
Closing by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, in respect of those current or
former directors, officers and employees of the Acquired Company covered by
such liability insurance by obtaining a six (6) year "tail" policy containing
terms not less favorable than the terms of such liability insurance with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if any Claim is asserted or made within such
six (6) year period, such insurance coverage under such "tail" policy shall be
continued in respect of such Claim until the final disposition thereof;
_provided_ , _further_ , that each Party shall share equally the premium of
such "tail" policy.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 6.13_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of the Purchaser and the
Acquired Company. In the event that the Purchaser or the Acquired Company or
any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser or
the Acquired Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.13_.

 



 

SECTION 6.14 _Use of Certain Names_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 6.14_, within
forty-five (45) days following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the

expression similar thereto or constituting an abbreviation or extension
thereof and all trademarks, trade names, logos and symbols relating to the
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Company), including those

(collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "), including eliminating the Seller Marks

disposing of any unused stationery and literature of the Acquired Company

_Section 6.14(a)_ and _Section 6.14(b)_ from and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Company and its Affiliates
not to, use the Seller Marks, and the Purchaser acknowledges that it, its
Affiliates and the Acquired Company have no rights whatsoever to use the
Seller Marks. Without limiting the foregoing:

eliminate such Seller Marks from the name of the Acquired Company; and

 



 

(ii) within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, upon written request from
the Seller, the Purchaser shall provide evidence to the Seller, in a format

Company by the Seller from time to time during the use of the Seller Marks in

Purchaser shall take title to the Interests and such assets free of any such
Liens, and (iii) the Acquired Company to be released from any Liabilities
under the Seller Debt Facilities, in each case, pursuant to documents
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, acting in good faith.

 



 

(b) The Seller shall have the right to cause the Acquired Company to pay cash

Company subject to such Events of Loss to a condition reasonably comparable to

Company after the reasonably expected date of Closing as a result of such
Events of Loss, as each such cost or amount is estimated by a qualified firm

of any insurance (whether property damages, business interruption or
otherwise) proceeds actually available to the Purchaser with respect to such
Events of Loss (collectively, " _Restoration Costs_ "), or (ii) one or more

(b) Subject to the termination right set forth in clause (e) below, upon the
occurrence of one or more Events of Loss or Takings involving aggregate
Restoration Costs or Condemnation Value, as applicable, in excess of
$1,500,000 (a " _Major Loss_ "), the Seller may elect, in a written notice
delivered to the Purchaser, to either (i) reduce the amount of the Purchase
Price by the amount of Restoration Costs or Condemnation Value, as applicable,

Taken assets or properties prior to the Closing to a condition reasonably
comparable to their prior condition and reduce the Purchase Price by the

Company that would be reasonably expected to accrue after the Closing Date, as
determined by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the
Seller, as a result of such Events of Loss or Takings. If the Seller elects to
restore, repair or replace the damaged or Taken assets or properties in
accordance with clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence, the Seller will
complete or cause to be completed such repair, replacement or restoration
prior to the Closing, and if requested by the Seller, the Closing Date shall
be postponed for the amount of time reasonably necessary to complete such
restoration, repair or replacement of such property or assets for a period not
to exceed sixty (60) days after the date all other Closing conditions in

satisfied at Closing) or as otherwise reasonably agreed among the Purchaser
and the Seller (including, if necessary, the extension of the Outside Date to
allow further restoration, repair or replacement of such assets or

Purchase Price reduction (net of out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by the Seller and its Affiliates to restore, repair or replace such
property or assets prior to the Closing), and, with respect to the period
after Closing, the Seller and its Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue and collect such insurance proceeds or condemnation
proceeds, and the Seller shall be entitled to all such proceeds to the extent
in excess of the Purchase Price reduction. If the Seller restores, repairs or
replaces the damaged or Taken assets or properties in accordance with the
foregoing clause (ii), then the Seller shall be entitled to all insurance
proceeds or condemnation proceeds, as applicable, applicable thereto, whether
received before or after the Closing.

 



 

(c) Subject to the termination right set forth in clause (e) below, if (i) the
Seller does not make an election under _Section 6.16(b)_ within thirty (30)

(d) To assist the Purchaser in its evaluation of an Event of Loss or Taking,
the Seller shall provide the Purchaser such access to the properties and
assets and such information as the Purchaser may reasonably request in
connection therewith.

 



 

(e) In the event that aggregate Restoration Costs or Condemnation Values, as

excess of 15% of the Base Purchase Price, then the Purchaser and the Seller
each shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by delivery of written
notice to the other Party within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
PurchaserÂ’s receipt of written notice of the estimate of the Restoration Costs
or Condemnation Value, as applicable, determined by the qualified firm

(f) With respect to any Event of Loss incurred by the Acquired Company with
respect to any pre-Closing event that is covered by any occurrence-based

at the PurchaserÂ’s sole cost and expense, the Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue and collect insurance proceeds under any such
occurrence-based insurance policy with respect to such Pre-Closing Claim in
the event that, after Closing, the Seller or any of its Affiliates receives
insurance proceeds with respect to any such Pre-Closing Claim, the Seller
shall pay to the Purchaser or the Acquired Company, within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt thereof an amount equal to such insurance proceeds, _minus_
(i) the SellerÂ’s and its AffiliatesÂ’ out of pocket costs and expenses incurred
in connection with obtaining such insurance proceeds and (ii) any amount of
such proceeds in respect of reimbursement to the Seller and its Affiliates for
pre-Closing out-of-pocket repair costs incurred or pre-Closing business
interruption losses. In addition, the Purchaser and the Acquired Company shall

deductible or retrospective premium with respect to any such Pre-Closing Claim
and shall reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such claims to the
extent not covered by clause (i) above.

with the Financing or any information provided in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the PurchaserÂ’s

precedent to the PurchaserÂ’s obligation to consummate the Closing hereunder

SECTION 8.02 " _As Is" Sale; Release_.

 



 

(a) EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN _ARTICLE 3_
AND _ARTICLE 4_ AND IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, AND EXCEPT FOR THOSE
ITEMS FOR WHICH THE PURCHASER IS EXPRESSLY INDEMNIFIED PURSUANT TO _SECTION
9.01(a)_, (I) THE ACQUIRED COMPANY AND THE INTERESTS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED "AS
IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS," AND (II) PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS
NOT RELIED ON, AND THE SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY, REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION,
VALUE OR QUALITY OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY, THE INTERESTS OR THE PROSPECTS
(FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY

and unconditionally release, acquit and forever discharge, the Seller and its

their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns,
from any and all costs, expenses, damages, debts, or any other obligations,

liability or breach of any fiduciary duty relating to any pre-Closing actions
or failures to act by the Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the Acquired Company prior to the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Purchaser, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby absolutely,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any and all rights and benefits with
respect to any Liabilities and Claims that it now has, or in the future may
have conferred upon it by virtue of any principle under Law which provides
that a general release does not extend to claims which a party does not know
or suspect to exist in its favor at the time of executing the release, if
knowledge of such claims would have materially affected such partyÂ’s
settlement with the obligor, in each case, other than any rights and benefits
expressly set forth in this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the
Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it is aware that factual matters now
unknown to it, the Seller, the Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates may have given, or hereafter may give, rise to Liabilities and
Claims under Law, and the Purchaser further agrees that the releases and other
provisions set forth in this _Section 8.02_ and _Section 8.03_ have been
negotiated and agreed upon in light of that awareness, and the Purchaser, for
itself and its Affiliates, nevertheless hereby intends absolutely, irrevocably

Claims, except, in each case, for the remedies expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault for any matter

Entity is obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Entity hereunder or (ii) lost
profits are taken into account in calculating Restoration Costs or
Condemnation Value; and

SECTION 9.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each,
an " _Indemnified Entity_ ") believes that a Claim or other fact or
circumstance exists that has given or may give rise to a right of
indemnification under this _Article 9_ (whether or not the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable), a Claim for
indemnification by such Indemnified Entity shall be asserted by giving written
notice thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Party from which indemnification
is sought pursuant to _Section 9.01_ or _Section 9.02_, as applicable (the "
_Indemnifying Entity_ "). The Claim Notice shall be given as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Indemnified Entity becomes aware of any fact
or circumstance that it reasonably believes would give rise to a Claim for
indemnity. Each Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of
the Claim, identify the sections of this Agreement that form the basis of such
Claim, attach copies of all material written evidence thereof received from
any Person not a Party or affiliated with any Party (a " _Third Party_ ") to
the date of the Claim Notice and set forth the estimated amount of
Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto to the extent reasonably estimable. The
failure of the Indemnified Entity to notify or a delay in notifying the
Indemnifying Entity, as the case may be, will not relieve the Indemnifying
Entity of its obligations pursuant to this _Article 9_, except to the extent
that such Indemnifying Entity is materially prejudiced as a result thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Entity shall not be liable for
any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Entity in defending or
investigating such Claim during the period in which the Indemnified Entity
failed to give the Claim Notice.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of a
Claim brought by a Third Party, the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Claim by giving notice of its intention to do so to
the Indemnified Entity within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such Claim
Notice. Upon timely delivery of such notice, the Indemnifying Entity shall be
entitled to (i) assume and have sole control over the defense and
investigation of such Claim at its sole cost and expense (subject to the last
sentence of this _Section 9.03(b)_, and with counsel of its own choosing that
is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Entity, and (ii) negotiate a
settlement or compromise of or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect
to, such Claim; _provided_ that if such settlement, compromise or consent (x)
does not include a full and unconditional waiver and release by the Third
Party of all applicable Indemnified Entities for all costs or Liabilities with
respect to such Claim or (y) imposes any Liability (including any admission of
fault) on any Indemnified Entity or its Affiliates, then such settlement,
compromise or consent shall be permitted hereunder only with the written
consent of the Indemnified Entity (whether or not the Indemnified Entity is an
actual or potential party to such Claim),which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If within thirty (30) days of
receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice

 



       
 

 



 

with respect to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Entity (A) advises such
Indemnified Entity in writing that the Indemnifying Entity does not elect to
defend and investigate such Claim, (B) is not entitled to assume and control
the defense or investigation of such Claim or (C) fails to make such an
election in writing, then (1) such Indemnified Entity may, at its option,
defend, investigate, settle or compromise, or consent to an entry of judgment
with respect to, such Claim; _provided_ that any such settlement, compromise
or consent shall be permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the
Indemnifying Entity (whether or not the Indemnifying Entity is an actual or
potential party to such Claim), which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (2) the Indemnifying Entity may
participate in (but not control) any such defense and investigation at its
sole cost and expense. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the
Indemnifying Entity all information available to such Indemnified Entity
relating to such Claim, except as may be prohibited by applicable Law or
privilege, including providing the Indemnifying Entity promptly (but in any
event within five (5) Business Days) after the Indemnified EntityÂ’s receipt
thereof with copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Entity relating to any Claim by a Third Party. In
addition, the Parties shall render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense and
investigation of any such Claim. If the Indemnifying Entity timely elects to
assume control of the defense and investigation of any such Claim in
accordance with the first sentence of this _Section 9.03(b)_ then the
Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) such
defense and investigation with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Entity at such Indemnified EntityÂ’s sole cost and expense;
_provided_ that such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying
Entity if in the opinion of counsel, a conflict of interest between the
Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying Entity may exist in respect of such
Claim or such Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation. In the event the
Indemnifying Entity timely assumes control of the defense and investigation of
any such Claim in accordance with the first sentence of this _Section
9.03(b)_, the Indemnified Entity shall reimburse the Indemnifying Entity for
all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Entity in connection with
such defense and investigation (or negotiation, settlement, compromise or
consent) to the extent, if applicable, that such costs and expenses do not
exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible; _provided_ that such costs and
expenses shall be included in the calculation of the Deductible.

 



 

SECTION 9.04 _Indemnification Generally_.

 



 

(a) The amount of Indemnifiable Losses which the Indemnifying Entity is or may
be required to pay to any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this _Article 9_
shall be (i) reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds
or other amounts received by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity or its
Affiliates related to such Indemnifiable Losses and (ii) shall not include any
Indemnifiable Loss with respect to a matter that was taken into account in the
adjustments contemplated by _Section 2.05_. An Indemnified Entity shall take,
or cause its Affiliates to take, commercially reasonable actions to pursue
payment from any Third Party with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss under any
Contract, arrangement or commitment pursuant to which such Indemnified Entity
or its Affiliates are entitled to reimbursement or indemnification with
respect to such Indemnifiable Loss. If an Indemnified Entity shall have
received the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Entity
in respect of Indemnifiable Losses (including any Purchase Price adjustment
with respect to the circumstances giving rise to

 



      
 

 



 

such payment under this _Article 9_) and shall subsequently receive (or any
of its Affiliates shall subsequently receive) any insurance proceeds or other
amounts in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses, then such Indemnified Entity
shall promptly repay, or cause to be repaid, to the Indemnifying Entity a sum
equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually
received.

 



 

(b) In addition to the requirements of _Section 9.04(a)_, each Indemnified
Entity shall be obligated in connection with any Claim for indemnification
under this _Article 9_ to take commercially reasonable actions to mitigate
Indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming aware of any fact or circumstance
that may give rise to such Indemnifiable Losses.

 



 

(c) Subject to the rights of any Person providing insurance as contemplated by
_Section 9.04(a)_, the Indemnifying Entity shall be subrogated to any right,
defense or Claim that the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person
with respect to any matter giving rise to a Claim for indemnification
hereunder. Such Indemnified Entity shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Entity in a reasonable manner, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Entity, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or Claim.

 



 

(d) The indemnification provided in this _Article 9_ shall be the exclusive
post-Closing remedy available to any Party or its Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except in the case of intentional fraud or willful misconduct.

 



 

(e) All Indemnifiable Losses shall be determined without duplication of
recovery under other provisions of this Agreement or any other document or
agreement delivered in connection with this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the prior sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events
constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of this Agreement that is subject to an indemnification obligation
under this _Article 9_, only one recovery of Indemnifiable Losses shall be
allowed with respect to such set of facts, conditions or events, and in no
event shall there be any indemnification or duplication of payments or
recovery under different provisions of this Agreement arising out of the same
set of facts, conditions or events.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.05_ shall not be considered Indemnifiable Losses for
purposes of this _Article 9_.

 



 

(g) Neither Party shall have any right to off-set or set-off any payment due
pursuant to this _Article 9_.

 



 

(h) The Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by a change in Law occurring after the date hereof, a closing
agreement with an applicable Taxing Authority, or a final non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE 10 _ 
Termination_

 



 

SECTION 10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

 



 

(a) at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written agreement of the
Purchaser and the Seller;

 



 

(b) by either the Purchaser or the Seller by giving written notice to the
other Party if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to one hundred
and eighty (180) days after the date that the FERC Application was filed with
the FERC (as extended pursuant to this _Section 10.01(b)_ or _Section
11.07(b)_, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if as of
the original Outside Date set forth above, all of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Article 7_ have been satisfied or waived, as
applicable, or shall then be capable of being satisfied (except for any
condition set forth in _Section 7.01_), then the Outside Date may be extended
up to two (2) times by either Party by delivering written notice to the other
Party before the then applicable Outside Date; _provided_ that the Outside
Date shall not be extended under this clause (i) by more than thirty (30) days
at a time or by more than sixty (60) days in the aggregate, and (ii) the right
to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.01(b)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date;

 



 

(c) by either the Purchaser or the Seller by giving written notice to the
other Party if the condition to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_ is
not satisfied and the Legal Restraint giving rise to such nonsatisfaction has
become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 10.01(c)_ shall not be available to any Party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of or resulted in, such order, decree, ruling or other action;

 



 

(d) by either the Purchaser or the Seller by giving written notice to the
other Party if there has been a breach by such other Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement (other than involving the PurchaserÂ’s failure to complete the
Closing, which is exclusively addressed in _Section 10.01(h)_) and such
breach (i) would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the
conditions to the Closing of the Party sending such notice (set forth in
_Section 7.01_, _Section 7.02_ or _Section 7.03_, as applicable) and (ii)
has not been cured or is not capable of being cured (to the extent necessary
to avoid a failure of such a condition) prior to the earlier of (A) the
Business Day prior to the Outside Date or (B) the date that is thirty (30)
days from the date that the breaching Party is notified in writing by the
other Party of such breach; _provided_ that (1) the Purchaser shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(d)_ if
the Purchaser is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained herein and such breach would result in
the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions to the Closing set forth
in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.03_ and (2) the Seller shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(d)_ if
the Seller or the Acquired Company are then in breach of any of their
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained herein
and such breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02_;

 



 

(e) by the Purchaser by giving written notice to the Seller after the delivery
by the Seller of a Schedule Update if such Schedule Update discloses a fact,
circumstance,

 



      
 

 



 

development, event or occurrence first arising after the date of this
Agreement, the existence of which, if not included in such Schedule Update,
would have otherwise permitted the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_ (with or without giving effect to any cure
period contained in _Section 10.01(d)_); _provided_ that, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Purchaser shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.01(e)_ as a result of any Schedule Update that
relates to any actions permitted by or taken in accordance with _Section
6.02_;

 



 

(f) by the Seller or the Purchaser pursuant _Section 6.16(e)_;

 



 

(g) by the Purchaser, if, as a condition to granting the FERC Approval, FERC
requires that the Purchaser or its Affiliates effect or accept any FERC
Mitigation Requirement; or

 



 

(h) by the Seller if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_
and _Section 7.02_ have been satisfied (or are then capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) or waived in accordance with this Agreement as of
the date that the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to _Section
2.03_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing), (ii) the Purchaser does not complete the Closing on the day that
the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to _Section 2.03_, (iii)
the Seller has delivered written notice to the Purchaser expressly referencing
this _Section 10.01(h)_, with an irrevocable commitment from the Seller that
it stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing within the
subsequent three (3) Business Days and requesting that the Closing be
consummated, and (iv) the Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing within
three (3) Business Days following its receipt of such notice from the Seller
and clause (i) remains satisfied on such third (3rd) Business Day.

 



 

SECTION 10.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by _Section 10.01_, this
Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or effect and no
Party shall have any liability to the other Party under this Agreement, except
(i) that _Section 6.01(b)_, _Section 6.04_, _Section 6.06_, _Section
8.04_, this _Article 10_ and _Article 11_ (and any definitions set forth on
_Exhibit A_ that are relevant to such provisions) shall survive such
termination and remain in full force and effect and (ii) if this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_, _Section 10.01(e)_ or
_Section 10.01(h)_, then, subject to the limitations in _Section 8.03(b)_
and this _Section 10.02_, the terminating Party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at law or in equity in respect of the action or
breach giving rise to such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein and subject to _Section 11.07_, in no event shall the
liability of the Purchaser or any of its Representatives, on one hand, and the
Seller or any of its Representatives, on the other hand, other than following
the Closing hereunder (which shall be subject to _Article 9_), exceed
Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000) (the " _Termination Damages Cap_ ") in
the aggregate for any and all Indemnifiable Losses suffered or incurred by
such Person in connection with this Agreement or any Other Transaction
Agreement as a result of a termination of this Agreement by the terminating
Party pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_, _Section 10.01(e)_ or _Section
10.01(h)_, and any action or breach giving rise to such termination, and no
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Claim (whether in law or in
equity) against any Party or its

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives arising out of or in connection with any such termination of
this Agreement, or any such action or breach, in excess of the Termination
Damages Cap. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings,
applications and other submissions made to any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Entity to which
they were made to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Until such time as
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 10.01_, nothing in
this _Article 10_, including nothing in this _Section 10.02(a)_, shall
prohibit either Party from seeking specific performance pursuant to, and on
the terms and conditions set forth in, _Section 11.07_, except as otherwise
set forth in _Section 11.07_.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser or the Seller pursuant to
_Section 10.01_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated,
without further action by any Party; _provided_ that upon written request from
the Seller, (i) the Purchaser, at its option, shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to, either (A) redeliver to the Seller all
written Confidential Information (including Confidential Information stored on
electronic, magnetic or similar media) or (B) destroy (and deliver a
certificate, signed by an officer of the Purchaser, to the Seller certifying
such destruction) all written Confidential Information, whether obtained
before or after the execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Purchaser may retain one copy of any written Confidential Information in
addition to any archived copies of Confidential Information stored on
electronic, magnetic or similar media in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (ii) the Purchaser shall continue to treat all Confidential
Information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination hereof.

SECTION 11.02 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable
for any reason shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
provision is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. If any provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be so broad as
to be unenforceable, that provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad
as is enforceable.

 



 

SECTION 11.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall, taken together, be considered one and the same agreement. Delivery of
an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic

counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.04 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended

 



      
 

 



 

except by an instrument in writing signed by the Purchaser and the Seller.
Each Party may, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party,
waive compliance by any other Party with any term or provision of this
Agreement that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform.
No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

 



 

SECTION 11.05 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
(together with the written agreements, Schedules and certificates referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto) constitute the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as
provided in _Section 6.01(b)_, _Section 6.13_, _Section 8.03(a)_ or
_Article 9_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their
permitted assigns and is not intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 11.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether
at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may be based
on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution,
performance or subject matter hereof shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

SECTION 11.07 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or was otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at law or in equity. The Parties hereby waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and the
posting of any bond or other undertaking or security in connection therewith.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
there is adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each Party further agrees
that (i) by seeking any remedy provided in this _Section 11.07_, a Party
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to a Party under this Agreement and (ii) nothing contained in
this _Section 11.07_ shall require any Party to institute any action for (or
limit any PartyÂ’s right to institute any action for) specific performance
under this _Section 11.07_ before exercising any other right under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) If any Party brings any Claim to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such
Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by the time period between the commencement of such
Claim and the date on which such Claim is fully and final

 



      
 

 



 

resolved.

 



 

SECTION 11.08 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Except as
provided in _Section 2.05_, each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York or, if such court disclaims jurisdiction, any state court located in
the Borough of Manhattan in the State of New York, for the purposes of any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. certified mail to
such PartyÂ’s respective address set forth in _Section 11.01_ shall be
effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State
of New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of
the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in (a) the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York or (b) any state court located in the Borough of
Manhattan in the State of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. **EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY**. The
Parties agree that any proceeding arising under this Agreement may be joined
or consolidated with any proceeding arising under the Purchaser Parent
Guaranty relating to the same subject matter.

 



 

SECTION 11.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Party; _provided_ , that the Purchaser may
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole but not in
part, to any Affiliate of the Purchaser (in which case the Purchaser shall be
released from all Liabilities under this Agreement as long as the Purchaser
Parent Guaranty remains in full force and effect for the term thereof and with
respect to all obligations of the assignee under this Agreement) or for
collateral purposes to any Financing Party. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this _Section
11.09_ shall be null and void, _ab initio_.

 



 

SECTION 11.10 _Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, all Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits referred to herein are
intended to be and hereby are made a part of this Agreement. Any disclosure in
the Schedules corresponding to and qualifying a specific section or subsection
hereof shall be deemed to correspond to and qualify any other section or
subsection hereof relating to the Seller or the Acquired Company (in the case
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) or the Purchaser (in the case of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule) only to the extent such disclosure makes the
relevance to such other section or subsection hereof reasonably apparent on
its face. Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included solely
for informational purposes, is not an admission of liability with respect to
the matters covered by the information, and may not be required to be
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion

 



      
 

 



 

of any specific item in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such
amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party
shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion
of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the
Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
In no event will the listing of any matter in the Schedules be deemed or
interpreted to broaden or otherwise amplify the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.11 _Acknowledgement and Waiver_.

 



 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Seller and the Acquired
Company have retained Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (" _Skadden_ ")
to act as their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that Skadden has not acted as counsel for any other Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for conflict of interest
or any other purposes. The Purchaser agrees that any attorneyÂ—client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of SkaddenÂ’s
representation of the Seller and the Acquired Company related to the
preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all communications among Skadden and
Seller, the Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates in preparation
for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect.
Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all communications (and
materials relating thereto) between the Acquired Company, on the one hand, and
Skadden or any other legal counsel or financial advisor, on the other hand,
related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are hereby assigned and
transferred to the Seller, (ii) the Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the
Acquired Company, hereby releases all of their respective rights and interests
to and in such communications and related materials and (iii) the Purchaser,
on behalf of itself and the Acquired Company, hereby releases any right to
assert or waive any privilege related to the communications referenced in this
_Section 11.11_.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Acquired Company by Skadden, Skadden shall be allowed to
represent the Seller or any of its Affiliates in any matters and disputes
adverse to the Purchaser or the Acquired Company that either is existing on
the date hereof or arises in the future and relates to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Purchaser, on behalf of itself and
the Acquired Company, hereby waives any conflicts or claim of privilege that
may arise in connection with such representation. Further, the Purchaser
agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after Closing between the
Purchaser or the Acquired Company and the Seller or any of its Affiliates,
Skadden may represent the Seller or its Affiliate in such dispute even though
the interests of the Seller or its Affiliate may be directly adverse to the
Purchaser or the Acquired Company and even though Skadden may have represented
the Acquired Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with
the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Company) shall
not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely by the Seller
or its Affiliate. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges that each of them have had
the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate

 



      
 

 



 

information concerning the significance and material risks of and reasonable
available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of
this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other than
Skadden.

 **EXHIBIT A**
