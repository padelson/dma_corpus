MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR

CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER

4.1 _Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares
in the Merger_.

(a) _Merger Consideration_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Holdco, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock or the
holders of any capital stock of Merger Sub, (A) each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares (as defined in 
_Section 4.1(c)_) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into the right
to receive under applicable Law and from Holdco, pursuant to _Section 4.2_,
upon the surrender of the certificates evidencing the Company Common
Stock (or evidence of shares in book entry form), (x) the Parent Stock
Consideration, which Parent Stock Consideration shall, for purposes of the
Laws of The Netherlands, be paid up by the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock as described in  _Section 4.1(a)(ii)_ below, and (y) the Cash
Consideration (together, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest
thereon, and such shares of Company Common Stock (or evidence of shares in
book entry form) automatically shall be cancelled and

 



13  extinguished, in accordance with _Section 4.2_ and (B) each holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) shall
be entitled to receive from Parent the Dutch Compensation Amount (as defined
in clause (v) below) to be set off against the obligation to pay up the Parent
Ordinary Shares as described in _Section 4.1(a)(ii)_. Parent shall cause
Holdco to take all applicable actions required under this _Section
4.1(a)(i)_.

(ii) By virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock, each such holder shall be
deemed to have subscribed hereunder for the Parent Ordinary Shares to be
issued to such holder in accordance with this _Article IV_. In accordance
with the Laws of The Netherlands, each such holder, as a result of such deemed
subscription, shall be obligated to pay up such Parent Ordinary Shares in an
amount, determined solely for the purpose of satisfying such obligation, equal
to the Dutch Compensation Amount (as defined below) to which such holder is
entitled by virtue of the Merger. Such obligation shall be satisfied by each
such holder, upon exchange of certificates (or evidence of shares in book
entry form) in accordance with _Section 4.2_, by set off against its right
to receive the Dutch Compensation Amount. In no event shall such obligation
reduce the amount of Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
hereunder.

 

(iii) Holdcos obligation to deliver the Merger Consideration to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Article IV, may be assigned, in whole or in
part, to Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such assignment shall relieve Holdco of its obligations hereunder.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to _Section 7.1(c)_, if prior
to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Ordinary Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend or distribution,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), combination or exchange of shares or other similar
transaction, and, in each such case, the record date for such transaction is
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, then any number or
amount contained herein that is based upon the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Ordinary Shares, as the case may be, will be adjusted
as appropriate to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any stock repurchase by Parent, (B) the
reverse stock split and any other actions associated with the
Parent Synthetic Buyback or any similar transaction, shall not require or
result in any adjustment hereunder. As provided in _Section 4.4_, the right
of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration
shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding under
applicable Tax Law.

 



14 (v) _Definitions_. For purposes hereof, the following terms have
the following respective meanings:

" _Cash Consideration_ " means an amount per share of Company Common Stock
in cash equal to US $20.00.

" _Conversion Ratio_ " shall equal 1.1502.

 

" _Dutch Compensation Amount_ " equals the Euro par value amount required to
satisfy the pay up obligation resulting from the deemed subscription by each
holder of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) of the
amount of whole Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued to such holder in
accordance with this _Article IV_.

 

" _Parent Stock Consideration_ " means an amount of Parent Ordinary Shares
equal to the Conversion Ratio.

 

(b) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional Parent Ordinary Shares shall be
issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Ordinary
Shares shall be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the average of the last reported sales prices
of Parent Ordinary Shares, calculated to two (2) decimal places, as reported
on NASDAQ, on each of the five (5) trading days ending on the third trading
day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Parent Stock Price_ ")
by (B) the fractional Parent Ordinary Shares to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled. The Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of Parent Ordinary Shares without interest, subject to and in
accordance with  _Section 4.2_.

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding and owned by Parent, Holdco, Merger Sub, Merger Sub 2 or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, or held in the treasury of the
Company or owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall
cease to be outstanding, and automatically shall be cancelled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each share of Merger Sub Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a share of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation
Capital Stock_ ").

(e)  _Dissenting Shares_. Pursuant to NRS 92A.390, no dissenters rights or
rights of appraisal will apply in connection with the Merger.

(f) _Conversion of Surviving Corporation Common Stock_. At the effective time
of the Subsequent Merger, and without any action on the part of Parent,
Holdco, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub 2 or any holder of shares or
other equity interests thereof, each share of Surviving Corporation Capital
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one limited liability company interest of the Surviving LLC
and shall constitute the only limited liability company interests of the
Surviving LLC. From

 



15  and after the effective time of the Subsequent Merger, all certificates
representing shares of Surviving Corporation Capital Stock shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of limited liability company interests
of the Surviving LLC into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

4.2 _Exchange of Stock Certificates_. Certificates (or evidence of shares in
book entry form) for shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as exchange agent under this Agreement (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") and who shall serve pursuant to an agreement between Parent, Holdco
and the Exchange Agent, the terms of and conditions of which are reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). Immediately
prior to the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause Holdco to, deliver to the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock an amount in cash equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted in the Merger _plus_
any cash due in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a
form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may specify, subject to the Companys reasonable approval, together with
instructions thereto. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by a certificate, the surrender of such certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive (and
the Exchange Agent shall deliver) (A) certificates (or electronic equivalents)
representing the number of Parent Ordinary Shares into which such shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been converted in the Merger, and (B) a bank
check for an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted plus any cash due in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(b)_.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of
any certificates (or electronic equivalents) for Company Common Stock not
surrendered until such certificates (or electronic equivalents) for Company
Common Stock are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided
in this _Section 4.2_ Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
Person in whose name the Parent Ordinary Shares have been registered, (i) the
amount of all dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date on
or after the Effective Time and previously paid or payable on the date

 



16  of such surrender with respect to such surrendered securities, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
if any, with a record date on or after the Effective Time and prior to
surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such securities.

(d) In no event shall the holder of any surrendered certificates (or evidence
of shares in book entry form) be entitled to receive interest on any of the
Cash Consideration to be received in the Merger. 

(e) If any certificate (or electronic equivalents) for such Parent Ordinary
Shares or check for the Cash Consideration is to be issued in the name of a
Person other than the Person in whose name the certificates (or electronic
equivalents) surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a
condition of the exchange that the certificates (or electronic equivalents)
so surrendered shall be endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of
such check to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificates
(or electronic equivalents) surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(f) If, for any reason (including losses), the Exchange Agent shall not have
sufficient funds or Parent Ordinary Shares to pay the amounts to which
holders of Company Common Stock are entitled under this _Article IV_ , Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall take all steps necessary to promptly deposit
with the Exchange Agent additional cash and Parent Ordinary Shares sufficient
to make all payments required under this _Article IV_. Any funds deposited
with the Exchange Agent (including any interest received with respect thereto)
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and the
Surviving Entity for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_ , in each case without any
interest thereon.

 

(g) If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such certificate, Parent shall direct the
Exchange Agent to issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such certificate, as contemplated by this
_Article IV_.

(h) None of the Company, Parent, Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent
Ordinary Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent, in each case, properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Ordinary Shares and any dividends or distributions remaining unclaimed as of a
date which is 

 



17  immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity free and clear of
any claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any of the funds deposited with the
Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the exchange fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under _Section 4.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent.
No investment of the funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this _Article IV_ , and
following any net losses from any such investment, Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of
the applicable holders of any shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses, which additional funds
shall be deemed to be part of the funds. No investment of the funds shall
have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to
this Agreement.

(j) Except for the right to surrender of the certificate(s) (or evidence of
shares in book entry form) representing the Company Common Stock in exchange
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each share
of Company Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary
Shares, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist at the Effective
Time and each holder of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as
a stockholder of the Company, and no transfer of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. 

4.3 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, at
the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
granted under any equity compensation plan or arrangement of the Company and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Option_ "),
whether or not vested or exercisable, (i) shall, to the extent vested and
exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in respect thereof, a cash
payment equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the sum of (1) the Cash
Consideration and (2) the product of (x) the Parent Stock Price multiplied by
(y) the Conversion Ratio, over (B) the per share exercise price of the Company
Option or (ii) with respect to each other Company Option, shall be assumed by
Parent and shall be converted into a stock option (a " _Parent Stock Option_
") to acquire Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with this _Section 4.3_.
Each Parent Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as

 



18  applied to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that each Parent Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall be for
that number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the related Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per Parent Ordinary Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock of such Company Option by (y) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ , that the exercise price and the number of Parent Ordinary Share
subject to the Parent Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of
Company Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of (i) the Conversion Ratio and
(ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Cash Consideration by (2) the
Parent Stock Price.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, at
the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award granted under any equity
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company RSU_ ") that is not then vested
shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted stock
unit award (a " _Parent RSU_ ") to acquire Parent Ordinary Shares in
accordance with this _Section 4.3_. Each Parent RSU as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that each Parent RSU as so assumed and converted shall be for
that number Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying the related Company RSU multiplied
by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio.

(c) Immediately prior to the Closing, in the case of any outstanding purchase
rights under the Companys 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the
" _ESPP_ "), (i) the then-current purchase period under the ESPP shall
end and each participants accumulated payroll deduction shall be used to
purchase Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, (ii)
such Company Common Stock shall be treated the same as all other shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_ of this Agreement,
and (iii) the ESPP shall terminate immediately after such purchases, and all
rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company providing for the issuance or grant
of any other interest in respect of the Company Common Stock shall be
cancelled and of no further force or effect.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary actions
to effect the measures contemplated by this  _Section 4.3_, including
adoption of any plan amendments, obtaining Company Board approval and/or
obtaining any consents. Not later than the Closing Date, Parent shall file an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with
respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares subject to such Parent Stock Options or
Parent RSUs and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of
the related prospectus or prospectuses) for so long as such Parent Stock
Options and Parent RSUs remain outstanding.

 



19 4.4 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Holdco,
Parent and their respective agents shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration or any other amount otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any
Tax Law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Holdco, Parent or any of
their respective agents, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or
Company RSUs in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity,
Parent or the agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.
The Exchange Agent, the Surviving Entity, Parent or any of their respective
agents, as the case may be, shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts
so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period
required under applicable Law.

4.5  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent not prohibited under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this _Article IV_ by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form, report or document
with the SEC. Each of the Company Reports, as of the respective date of its
filing, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes Oxley Act, and any rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As

or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the
Securities Act)), and including similar collaboration, participation or off-
set arrangements or obligations, where the purpose or effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Company Reports
or the Company Financial Statements.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required
by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such controls and
procedures are reasonably effective to ensure that all material information

Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except for (i)
liabilities disclosed and provided for in the audited balance sheet for the

actions, suits, disputes or claims by or on behalf of any Employee Benefit

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the approval of the
Merger and this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or (iv) the
termination or constructive termination of the employment of such officers
following one of the events set forth in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above and

officer of the Company under Section 280G of the Code.

 

(h) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation

been maintained and operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable Internal Revenue Service
guidance promulgated thereunder so as to avoid any Tax, penalty or interest
under Section 409A of the Code and, as to any such plan in existence prior to
January 1, 2005, has not been "materially modified" (within the meaning of

Plan_ ") that is intended to comply with the requirements of any Tax or
pension Laws in order for contributions thereto or benefits thereunder to
receive intended Tax benefits or favorable Tax treatment complies in all
material respects with such Laws. Each Foreign Plan required to be registered
or approved by a non-U.S. Governmental Entity has been registered or approved
and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities, and no event has occurred since the date of the most
recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Foreign Plan
that could reasonably be expected to materially affect any such approval
relating thereto or increase the costs relating thereto in a manner material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole. Each Foreign Plan is fully
funded or fully insured on an ongoing and termination or solvency basis
(determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions) in compliance with
applicable Law, and the fair market 

 



30  value of the assets held under each Foreign Plan that is a pension plan or
that is funded on an actuarial basis is sufficient so as to permit a
termination of each such Foreign Plan, in full compliance with applicable Law
(to the extent such a fully funded or fully insured Foreign Plan may be
terminated in accordance with applicable Law), immediately after the Closing
Date without Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates being
required to make additional contributions to such Foreign Plan (or related
trust) or to incur any liability with respect to the funding or payment of
benefits under such Foreign Plan.

taxes with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan by the Internal Revenue
Service, the Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity.

(b) No individual is or is part of a unit represented by a labor union, labor

notice in the two (2) years preceding the date hereof from any third Person,
and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims (including in the form of offers or invitations to license) that (A)
assert the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any
Intellectual Property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) pertain
to or challenge the validity, enforceability, priority or registrability of,
or any right, title or interest of Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to, any Company Owned IP or Company Owned Technology. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have, in the two (2) years preceding the

any of its Subsidiaries as presently conducted in order to accommodate a
third Persons Intellectual Property.

 



35 (c) The Company and/or its Subsidiaries have implemented measures to maintain
the confidentiality of trade secrets owned or held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and other proprietary information, which measures are
reasonable in view of confidentiality practices that, to the Knowledge of the
Company, are generally engaged in within the industry in which the Company
operates. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any material disclosure or other
compromise of any confidential or proprietary information of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (including any such information of any other Person disclosed
in confidence to the Company or its Subsidiaries) to any third Person in a
manner that has resulted or is reasonably likely to result in the loss of

Event_ "), make a Board Recommendation Change if the Company Board has
concluded in good faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the
advice of, its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening

fiduciary duties under applicable Law (such Board Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event, an " _Intervening Event Board Recommendation
Change_ ") and terminate the Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.4(iii)_.

9.4(ii)_) in response to an Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof

legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ , that
such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.3_,
and that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make such a Board Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.4(ii)_ would reasonably be expected to
constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties. 

(e) " _Last Look_ ". Further, neither the Company Board nor a Committee shall
make a Board Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal as
permitted by _Section 7.3(d)_ or terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 9.4(ii)_, unless (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in
writing at least four (4) Business Days before taking such action, of its
intention to do so, attaching the most current version of any proposed
agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be consummated
and the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal, and (ii)
within four (4) Business Days after its receipt of such written notification,
Parent has not made an offer that the Company Board determines, in good faith,
after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms

Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.4(iii)_, 

 



55  unless (A) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least four
(4) Business Days before taking such action, of its intention to do so,
attaching a reasonably detailed explanation of the facts underlying the
determination by the Company Board of its need to make a Intervening Event
Board Recommendation Change and (B) within four (4) Business Days after its
receipt of such written notification, Parent has not made an offer that the
Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with, and taking
into account the advice of, its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, would obviate the need for a Intervening Event Board Recommendation
Change. During any such applicable period prior to its effecting a Board
Recommendation Change or an Intervening Event Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to and in compliance with this _Section 7.3_ or terminating
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.4(ii)_ or _Section 9.4(iii)_, the
Company and its representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) complying with any applicable securities Law, rule or
regulation, including Rule 14d-9 and Rule l4e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders required by applicable
Law, rule or regulation or by the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, or (iii)
otherwise making such disclosure to the Companys stockholders or otherwise
that the Company Board or a Committee (after consultation with, and
taking into account the advice of, its outside legal counsel) concludes in
good faith would reasonably be expected to be necessary in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that any such action taken or statement or disclosure made that
relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Board
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board publicly reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following such statement
or disclosure or in connection with such action (except that a mere "stop,
look and listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act or other similar communication shall not constitute a Board
Recommendation Change).

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (with all references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" in the definition thereof deemed to be "fifty percent (50%)"
for purposes of this definition) not solicited or initiated in violation of
this _Section 7.3_ that (i) the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its
outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors) would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, after taking into account any other binding proposal
made by Parent after Parents receipt of notice of an intention to make a
Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.4(ii)_ and the time likely to be required to consummate such
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside
financial advisors and its outside legal counsel) is reasonably capable of
being consummated on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, and for which
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Company Board.

 



56 7.4 _Stockholders Meeting; Proxy Statement; Registration Statement_.

 

(a) The Company shall:

(i) (A) use reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare (with the assistance
of Parent and its representatives) the Proxy Statement, (B) obtain and furnish

reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval (unless,
with respect to this clause (C), prior to such time the Company Board has made
a Board Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Board Recommendation
Change in accordance with _Section 7.3(c)_ or _Section 7.3(d)_);

(ii) include (unless prior to such time the Company Board has made a Board
Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Board Recommendation Change in

practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the

no event shall the Company mail the Proxy Statement to the Companys
stockholders prior to the earlier of (A) one (1) Business Day after the date
on which the closing of the Parent Synthetic Buyback occurs and (B) January 1,
2013; and

(iv) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting, to
be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing of the Registration
Statement, in which the Proxy Statement shall be included, with the SEC and
the completion of the SECs review of the Proxy Statement, and the Company
shall not adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting if there are sufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders
Meeting and the Company believes such shares will be voted in a number
sufficient to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Company may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting to the earliest
practicable date but no later than ten (10) Business Days from such
adjournment or postponement in order to permit the dissemination of any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or other disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if after consultation with, and taking into account the
advice of, its outside legal counsel, the Company Board or a Committee
determines in good faith that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to violate applicable Law, including their fiduciary
duties.

 



57 (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall each cause their respective
representatives to, fully cooperate with the Company in the preparation of
the Proxy Statement, and shall, upon request, furnish the Company with all

promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that is required by the applicable rules and regulations to be
set forth in the Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement.

(f) Except as may be required by Law, no amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the
Company without the approval of the other party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent and the Company each will advise the
other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments
thereon or requests for additional information by the SEC.

and as amended by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 ("

under any Contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries that would be violated
or under which consent otherwise is required as a result of entering into

reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other parties all information
required for any application, notification or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Laws in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company shall give each other reasonable
prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such
applications, notifications or filings or any such transaction. The parties
hereto agree that both Parent and Company shall be represented at all in-

and to the extent that, any Governmental Entity objects to any partys being

the extent that the communication or meeting relates to a national security
risk mitigation agreement between Parent and CFIUS or any of its constituent
agencies. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,

Laws and Exon-Florio.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any action or proceeding, including
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,

59  to take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions as may be necessary

other Person may assert under any Competition Laws with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Competition Laws that may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to the Merger so as
to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in
any event no later than the Termination Date (as such date may be extended
pursuant to _Section 9.2_); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 7.5_ or this Agreement shall require or be deemed to require Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action that would or would
reasonably be expected to result in or be any Burdensome Condition in order to
satisfy the conditions set forth in _Sections_ _8.1(b)_ , _8.1(c)(i)_ or 
_(ii)_. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Burdensome Condition_ " shall

ownership of the business of Parent or (y) requirement on how or where the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries conduct their
respective businesses (including, with respect to, market practices,

sale, divestiture or other disposition of any assets of the Company, Parent or
the Surviving Entity or their Subsidiaries (other than assets acquired or
licensed by Parent or its Subsidiaries from a third party (other than the
Company or its Subsidiaries) on or after September 30, 2012 (collectively, "
_Divestiture Assets_ ")), (B) a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, or (C) a material adverse effect on the benefits that
Parent reasonably expects to be realized or derived from the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the effect of any license,
sale, divestiture or other disposition of any Divestiture Assets shall not be
taken into account in determining whether the result described in clause (B)
or (C) has occurred. If requested by Parent, the Company will agree to any
action contemplated by this _Section 7.5(d)_, provided that such agreement or
action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent shall seek to obtain CFIUS Approval, _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this _Section 7.5_ will require or be deemed to require Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to agree to any terms or conditions, or take any

the Surviving Entity or their Subsidiaries, other than Divestiture
Assets, (ii) relate to Parents or its Subsidiaries assets, businesses or
operations (other than the Surviving Entitys and its Subsidiaries assets,
businesses and operations after the Effective Time or Divestiture Assets),
or (iii) would or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, a Parent Material Adverse

 



60  Effect, or a material adverse effect on the benefits that Parent reasonably
expects to be realized or derived from the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , that the effect of a license, sale, divestiture or other
disposition of any Divestiture Assets shall not be taken into account in
determining whether the result described in clause (iii) has occurred.

 

7.6 _NASDAQ Listing and Delisting_. Prior to Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and submit to NASDAQ a listing application, if required under NASDAQ
rules, covering the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable in the Merger, and shall
use best efforts to obtain approval for the listing of such Parent Ordinary
Shares, subject to official notice of issuance, and the Company
shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to such listing. Each of
the parties hereto agrees to cooperate with each other in taking, or causing
to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Company Common Stock from

representatives of Parent (" _Parent Representatives_ "), reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, representatives, plants, properties, contracts, commitments,
books and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) furnish or make available reasonably promptly to such Parent

_Section 7.7_ shall require the Company to disclose any information that, in
its sole and reasonable judgment, (i) it is not legally permitted to disclose
or the disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or binding
Order, (ii) the disclosure of which would jeopardize any attorney-client or
other legal privilege or (iii) the disclosure of which would conflict with,
violate or cause a default under any existing contract or agreement to which
it is a party; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is restricted in or prohibited from providing any
such access to any documents or data pursuant to any such contract or
agreement for the benefit of any third party, each of the Company and any
such Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
approval, consent or waiver with respect to such contract or agreement that is
necessary to provide such access to such officer, employee or agent. 

 



61  Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, if any of
the information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ includes
materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party
understands and agrees that the parties have a commonality of interest with
respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual
understanding of the parties that the sharing of such material or information
is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way
the confidentiality of such material or information or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information provided by the Company that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense
doctrine.

 

(d) No information received pursuant to an investigation made under this
_Section 7.7_ shall be deemed to (i) qualify, modify, amend or otherwise
affect any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements of the
Company set forth in this Agreement or any certificate or other instrument
delivered to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) amend or otherwise supplement the
information set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, (iii) limit or

out of a breach of this Agreement, or (iv) limit or restrict the ability of
either party to invoke or rely on the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement set
forth in _Article VIII_ hereof. 

7.8 _Publicity_. The parties agree that no press release or public statement
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
issued or made by any party without prior consultation with and consent of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except

agreement with or regulations of any stock exchange, national securities
exchange or automated quotation system, in which case the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party
before issuing any such press releases or making any such public
announcements; _provided_ , that each of Parent and the Company may include
disclosures relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated herein in its periodic filings with the SEC or non-U.S.
authorities or Governmental Entities without seeking approval from, or
consulting with, the other party so long as such disclosures are
substantially similar to the information contained in previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company
(or individually, if approved by the other party), or (ii) each of Parent and
the Company may make any public statement substantially similar to the
information contained in any press release, public disclosures or public
statements made in compliance with this _Section 7.8_, including in response
to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as such
statements are substantially similar to the information contained in press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made in compliance with
this _Section 7.8_.

 



62 7.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving LLC shall contain equivalent
provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses than are set forth in the Company Articles and Company Bylaws on the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required
by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent required by applicable
Law.

(b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and Parent shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless,
each present and former director, officer and employee of the Company and
each Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), in each case, to the extent they were
indemnified under the Company Articles, Company Bylaws and
indemnification contracts in effect as of the date hereof, arising out of or
pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director
or employee, at or prior to the Effective Time, for a period of six (6) years
after the date hereof. 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall and, if the Company is unable to,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Surviving
Entity as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for a single premium
"tail" policy, with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
on the current directors and officers liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any
additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof. If the
Company and the Surviving Entity for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
policy as of the Effective Time, then the Surviving Entity shall maintain for
six (6) years from the Effective Time such current directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided, that the
Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies, issued by an insurer
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time containing terms and conditions that are
not less favorable in the aggregate, including a "tail" policy);  _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to
expend pursuant to this _Section 7.9(c)_ more than an amount per year of
coverage equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company
for such insurance as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such current
policies, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be required to obtain as much
coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such maximum
annual amount in aggregate annual premiums. If any "tail" policy described
above is put in place, then from and after the 

 



63  effectiveness of such "tail" policy, neither Parent, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, shall have any further obligations under this _Section 7.9(c)_.

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity, or at Parents option,
Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.9_.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.9_.

 

(f) Each of the Indemnified Parties is an intended third party beneficiary of
this _Section 7.9_.

 

7.10 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent shall, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), provide to employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing as a group, other than (i) those
represented by a works council and (ii) those whose name is set forth on
_Section 7.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the employees whose names
are so set forth, the " _Change in Control Employees_ "), and who continue
employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates ("
_Continuing Employees_ ") (i) base compensation and incentive compensation
opportunities which are no less favorable, on an aggregate basis, to the base
compensation and incentive compensation (including equity incentive
compensation) opportunities provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing and (ii) pension and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the pension and welfare benefits provided as of
the Closing pursuant to the Employee Benefit Plans set forth on _Section
5.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent intends, for the
Continuation Period, to provide to the Change in Control Employees (i) base
compensation and incentive compensation opportunities which are not materially
less favorable, on an aggregate basis, than the base compensation
and incentive compensation (including equity compensation) opportunities
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and (ii)
pension and welfare benefits that are not materially less favorable in the
aggregate to the pension and welfare benefits provided as of the Closing
pursuant to the Employee Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 5.10(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter. The terms and conditions of employment for the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing, who
are represented by a works council and who continue with the Surviving Entity
or any of its Affiliates (" _Union Continuing Employees_ "), shall be governed
by the applicable collective bargaining or works council agreements.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, to provide to any
Continuing Employee who is laid-off or terminated without cause during the
Continuation Period with severance benefits in an amount that is equal to the
severance benefits (including severance payments and continued health
coverage) that the employee would have been entitled to pursuant to the terms
of the Reduction in Force Separation Benefits Plan.

 



64 (c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Entity, in which any Continuing Employee, Union Continuing Employee
or Change in Control Employee becomes a participant, Parent shall and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its third party insurers to provide
that the Continuing Employees, Union Continuing Employees or Change in Control
Employees shall receive full credit for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
determination of benefits under severance and vacation pay plans, to the same
extent that such service was recognized as of the Closing Date under a
comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which the Continuing Employee or Union
Continuing Employee participated (but not for purposes of benefit accrual and
not to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits).

(d) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its third party insurers to) (i) waive, or
cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employees, Union Continuing Employees or Change in Control Employees (and
their eligible dependents) are eligible to participate from and after the
Closing Date to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods were satisfied
or waived under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which the Continuing
Employees, Union Continuing Employees or Change in Control Employees
participated and (ii) cause any health benefit plan of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees, Union Continuing Employees or
Change in Control Employees participate after the Closing Date to recognize
the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee, Union Continuing Employee or Change in
Control Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying deductible and co-
payment limitations for such year under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Continuing Employee, Union Continuing Employee or Change in
Control Employee (and dependents) participates following the Closing Date.

(e) Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to identify
those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose continuing services
following the Closing are critical to the success of Parent and its

10.9 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement)
constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be assigned by any of
the parties hereto by operation of law or otherwise.

 

10.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. Except for as set forth in _Section 7.9_ and the last sentence
of this _Section 10.10_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, nothing shall
preclude the Company from pursuing equitable remedies pursuant to  _Section
10.7(c)_ or damages (including reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs and the benefit of the bargain lost by the stockholders of the Company,
taking into consideration relevant matters); provided, however, that (a) to
the extent the Company is enforcing or seeking to enforce any rights on behalf
of the stockholders of the Company, such rights may only be enforced and
sought by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion and (b) nothing
in this Agreement shall preclude Parent from contesting any such claims for
equitable remedies or damages. Following the Effective Time, the provisions of
_Article IV_ hereof shall be enforceable by any one or more of the
stockholders of the Company solely to the extent necessary to receive the
Merger Consideration to which each such

 



76  stockholder of the Company is entitled pursuant to _Article IV_ and to cause
the occurrence of the actions described in _Section 2.1(b)_.

 

10.11 _Obligation of Parent_. Whenever this Agreement requires Holdco, Merger
Sub or Merger Sub 2 to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such
action and a guarantee of the performance thereof.

10.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

10.13 _Certain Interpretations_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(a) Unless otherwise specified, all references in this Agreement to Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed to refer to Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement.

(b) Terms defined in the singular shall also include the plural and vice
versa.

(c) The table of contents and the Article, Section and paragraph captions
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof.

 

(d) The words "include," includes" and "including," when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(e) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "herewith," "hereto," and
"hereunder" and words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and references to
"the date hereof" shall mean the date of this Agreement.

(f) A reference in this Agreement to $ or dollars is to U.S. dollars and a
reference to  or EUR is to Euros.

(g) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel
during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive
the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
