Accounting Firm by Parent and the Securityholders Agent) of the disputed
items or amounts within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed

appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive that portion of the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Dissenting Shares as
provided in Section 1.5(a) hereof, but shall instead be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.8(a), if any holder of shares of Capital Stock who demands
appraisal of such holders shares under the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders right to
appraisal, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event, whichever
occurs later, such holders shares of Capital Stock shall automatically be
converted, and shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time,

Capital Stock.

(a) _Payment_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a bank or trust company to

resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property of, and will
be paid to, Parent. Parent shall pay all fees and expenses of the Payment

of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates and Company Warrants shall
pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or Company
Warrants or Lost Certificate Affidavit to the Payment Agent; (B) a general

Stock Certificates, Company Warrants or Lost Certificate Affidavit for the
Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such Capital Stock or
Company Warrant, as applicable. The form and substance of the Letter of
Transmittal shall be subject to the prior review of the Company or its
counsel and Parent shall consider any reasonable comments made thereon by the
Company or such counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company in developing
arrangements for the delivery of the Letter of Transmittal and instructions to
the Company stockholders listed on _Schedule 1.9(b)_ prior to Closing so as to
facilitate payment of the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such
stockholders as soon as practicable following the Closing, but no later than
two Business Days after the Closing. Upon the surrender to the Payment Agent
of a Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant, as applicable (or a Lost
Certificate Affidavit), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal

request, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant, as
applicable (or a Lost Certificate Affidavit), shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, if any,
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5 or Section
1.6, as applicable, at the time of such surrender, and the Company Stock
Certificate or Company Warrant so surrendered, if applicable, shall forthwith
be canceled. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Company Stock
Certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Capital
Stock or Company Warrant shall be deemed to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares
or Company Warrant, as applicable, and (ii) the holder of each such
Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant shall cease to have any rights
with respect to the shares of Capital Stock or Company Warrant, as applicable,
formerly represented thereby.

 

(c) _Payments to Others_. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of
shares of Capital Stock or Company Warrants converted pursuant to Section 1.5
or Section 1.6, as applicable, is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name a surrendered Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant, as
applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
the Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant, as applicable, so
surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment has paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of
the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant, as
applicable, surrendered or has established to the satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further

thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates for shares of Outstanding Capital Stock (" _Company Stock
Certificates_ ") or Company Warrants are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as provided for
in Section 1.5 or Section 1.6, as applicable. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on any Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate or Company Warrant, as applicable.

representing shares of Outstanding Capital Stock or Company Warrant shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to

Certificate or Company Warrant, as applicable, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant, as
applicable, to provide an appropriate affidavit (a " _Lost Certificate
Affidavit_ ") and to deliver a bond (in such amount, in such form and with
such surety as is customary for transactions of this nature, in the reasonable
discretion of Parent) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliated party
with respect to such Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant, as
applicable.

 

(f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to Non-Dissenting Stockholders or holders of Company
Warrants as of the date that is 365 days after the Closing Date shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and Non-Dissenting Stockholders or holders of
Company Warrants who have not theretofore surrendered their Company
Stock Certificates, Company Warrants or Lost Certificate Affidavits, as
applicable, in accordance with this Section 1.9 shall thereafter look only to
Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration payable
with respect to the shares of Capital Stock previously represented by such
Company Stock Certificates or Company Warrants, as applicable, without any
interest thereon.

neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any Non-Dissenting
Equityholder or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal
Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amounts remaining unclaimed
by Non-Dissenting Equityholders as of a date that is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of Parent free and clear of any Lien.

(h) _Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any

former securityholder of the Company such amounts as Parent determines in good
faith are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection
therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law
or under any other Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

(The financial statements referred to in the first sentence of this Section

since January 1, 2014, no Acquired Company has changed its methods of
accounting, accounting principles, accounting practices, collection practices,

(c) _Accounts Receivable_. All of the accounts receivable of the Acquired
Companies arose in the ordinary course of business, are carried on the
records of the Acquired Companies at values

 



22 determined in accordance with GAAP and are bona fide. No Person has any Lien

the "liabilities" column of the balance sheet included in the Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements; (ii) current liabilities incurred subsequent to
the date of the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practices; (iii) obligations that exist
under Company Contracts and that are expressly set forth in and identifiable
by reference to the text of such Company Contracts; and (iv) de minimis
Liabilities in the aggregate amount of $10,000 or less. The liabilities and

of Company Indebtedness, no Acquired Company is in default and no payments
are past due. No Acquired Company has received any notice of a default,
alleged failure to perform or any offset or counterclaim with respect to any
item of Company Indebtedness. Neither the consummation of any of
the Contemplated Transactions nor the execution, delivery or performance of
any Company Transaction Document will cause a material default, material
breach or a material acceleration, automatic or otherwise, of any conditions,
covenants or other terms of any Company Indebtedness. None of the Acquired
Companies has guaranteed or is responsible for any Indebtedness of any other
Person and none of the Acquired Companies has guaranteed any other obligation

enforceable in each applicable jurisdiction. All currently due maintenance
fees for issued Patents or renewal fees for registered Trademarks of the
Acquired Companies have been paid, and all necessary documents and
certificates in connection with the Company Registered Intellectual Property
have been filed with the relevant patent, trademark or other authorities in
the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the

and desist" letter, written, or to the Knowledge of the Company, oral
invitation to license or like correspondence or any written, or to the

operation of the business of any Acquired Company is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property

Property of any Person, and has not constituted or does not constitute unfair
competition or trade practices.

written or electronic communication or correspondence that has been sent
or otherwise delivered by or on the behalf of any Acquired Company regarding
any actual, alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation, dilution or

any material Company Owned Intellectual Property have executed agreements in
substantially the same form or forms Made Available to Parent and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, none of such employees, contractors or agents are,
or have been in, breach of such agreements. To the Knowledge of the Company,
no current or former employee, contractor or agent of any Acquired Company is
bound by any Contract restricting such employee, contractor or agent
from performing such employees, contractors or agents duties for the
applicable Acquired Company or in breach of any provision of any Contract with
any former employer or other Person concerning Intellectual Property or
confidentiality due to such employees, contractors or agents activities as

Acquired Company has suffered any material data loss, business interruption or
other harm as a result of, any "back door," "time bomb," "Trojan horse,"

material respects in accordance with its terms and with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Legal Requirements. The

(ii) increase any compensation or benefits otherwise payable by any Acquired
Company; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of

or knowingly encourage or facilitate the initiation or submission of any
expression of interest, inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other

inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request for non-public
information relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction that is received
by any Acquired Company during the Pre-Closing Period. Such notice shall

respective Representatives, to immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any and all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any Person

4.5 Termination of Certain Company Benefit Plans. The Company shall take (or
cause to be taken) all actions necessary and appropriate to terminate (a) all
Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code

Stock Plans, with such terminations to be effective on the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan to be
terminated as described in this Section 4.5, the Company shall deliver to
Parent, no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
evidence that the Companys board of directors (or, as applicable, the board
of directors of the appropriate Acquired Company) has adopted resolutions to
terminate such Company Benefit Plan (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and written evidence of any consent required to give
effect to such termination (including all required employee consents). For the
avoidance of any doubt, the termination of any Company Benefit Plans pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall be effected without any payment (or giving
rights to any payment) thereunder. In connection with the termination of the
401(k) Plans, Parent shall (i) permit each Continuing Employee to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance 

 



47  distributed to each such Continuing Employee from the applicable 401(k) Plan
to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) of Parent or any of its Affiliates (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") and
(ii) cause the loans of each Continuing Employee under the 401(k) Plans to
remain outstanding (and not go into default). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event will the Parent 401(k) Plan permit the eligible roll-over
distributions amounts from Roth IRA accounts or loan amounts borrowed from
such Roth IRA accounts as Parents 401(k) Plan does not permit Roth IRA
contributions, loans or accounts and eligible roll-over distributions and
loans must be made in accordance with Parents 401(k). As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, Parent shall permit the Continuing Employees who
participated in the 401(k) Plans to become participants in a Parent 401(k)
Plan.

has delivered to the Internal Revenue Service the notification required under
Section 1.8972(h)(2) of the Treasury Regulations (the " _FIRPTA

provides an accurate and complete breakdown of all amounts owed to any
Acquired Company by any Company Employee or stockholder of the Company.

 

4.9 Communications with Employees. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall not, and the Company shall ensure that no other Acquired Company and no
Representative of any Acquired Company shall, make promises or other
commitments to any Company Employees with respect to any matters regarding

the Company and Parent prior to the date of this Agreement without the prior
written approval of Parent.

deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Closing, the resignation (in form and
substance satisfactory to Parent) of each officer and director of each
Acquired Company from his or her corporate offices (but not his or her
employment) with such Acquired Company, effective as of the Effective Time

attached hereto as _Exhibit F_.

4.11 Closing Balance Sheet. At least five Business Days prior to the Closing

consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of immediately prior

Company as to the accuracy of such information). At least three Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall

 



48  deliver to Parent an estimated Merger Consideration Spreadsheet setting
forth the information required by Section 6.6(g). The Company shall be
responsible for making any payments required to effect any termination,
novation, amendment, consent or similar action required with respect to any
Contract and shall reflect such payment or other consideration incurred by any

4.13 Directors and Officers Indemnification; Tail Insurance.  

(a) During the period ending six years after the Effective Time, Parent will
ensure that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall fulfill the
obligations of the Company to the Companys present and former directors and
officers pursuant to the terms of the certificate of incorporation and/or
Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement, pursuant to
the DGCL, and as provided in any indemnification agreement in place between
the Company and any of the Companys present and former directors and officers
as of the date of this Agreement solely to the extent set forth in Item
4.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, in each case for events that occurred and
matters that arose prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in
no event shall Parent have any obligations pursuant to this sentence: (i) in
excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate; (ii) related to claims brought,
asserted or commenced by such present or former directors or officers or any
of their respective Affiliates; (iii) unless the DandO Tail policy has been
fully exhausted, and thereafter, unless the Surviving Corporation shall then
be unable to fully comply with its obligations under this sentence; and (iv)
after six years following the Effective Time. During such six-year
period referred to in the first sentence of this Section 4.13, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
provisions for indemnification, reimbursement, contribution or advancement of
expenses in the certificate of incorporation and/or Bylaws of the Company or
indemnification agreements referred to in Item 4.13(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule applicable to the Companys present and former directors and officers
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of such individuals in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), unless such modification is required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase (a) an extended
reporting period endorsement under each of the Acquired Companies existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage, including coverage for
fiduciary liability and employment practices liability (the " _D andO Tail_"),
for the Acquired Companies current and former directors and officers, which
shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years
following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and
have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons (other
than by virtue of being "tail" policies) than, the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage, including coverage for fiduciary liability and
employment practices liability, presently maintained by the Acquired
Companies and (b) a "tail" insurance policy that shall provide coverage not
less than the existing coverage for errors and omissions, with coverage for
three years following the Effective Time, and which shall have other terms
not materially less favorable to the insured person (other than by virtue of
being a "tail" policy) than the coverage presently maintained by such Acquired
Company (the " _E andO Tail_"). Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain the DandO Tail policy in full force and effect during
such six year period, and continue to honor all obligations thereunder for six
years following the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay any

 



49  amounts following the Effective Time with respect to the DandO Tail, including
any amounts to maintain the DandO Tail. For avoidance of doubt, the full cost
and all premiums associated with the DandO Tail and the EandO Tail shall be paid
in a lump sum by the Company prior to the Closing Date and shall be included
as a Company Transaction Expense if such premiums remain unpaid as of the
Closing.

be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 4.13 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained herein).

(i) Each Acquired Company shall timely prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed any Tax Returns that are required to be prepared and/or
filed prior to the Effective Time and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns within the time and in the manner required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on
such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of each
Acquired Company with respect to such items, except as required by applicable
Legal Requirements. Each Acquired Company shall deliver a draft of all such
Tax Returns at least 10 days prior to the due date (taking into account any
extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns to Parent for Parents review.
Each Acquired Company shall consider in good faith any reasonable comment that
Parent submits to each Acquired Company no less than five Business Days prior
to the due date of such Tax Returns.

(ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns (A) in respect of each Acquired Company that
relate to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date but that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date and (B) required to be filed by
each Acquired Company for a Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
past practices of each Acquired Company with respect to such items, except as
required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent shall deliver a draft of
all such Tax Returns at least 30 days prior to the due date (taking into
account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns to Securityholders
Agent for Securityholders Agents review and approval, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the expiration of the General
Representation Expiration Date, Parent shall have the right to withdraw from
the Escrow Fund the amount of Taxes reported on any such Tax Return for which
Parent reasonably determines that it (or another Indemnitee) is entitled to be
indemnified, held harmless, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to Section 9\.
The Securityholders Agent shall have the right to dispute any amount so
withdrawn (and claim that Parent must contribute all or a portion of such
amount back to the Escrow Fund). For the avoidance of doubt, Parents failure
to withdraw any amounts from the Escrow Fund under this Section 4.14(a) shall
not in any way limit Parents right to indemnification pursuant to Section 9\.

 

(b) _Termination of Powers of Attorney_. The Company shall cause each power of
attorney with respect to any Tax matters granted by or on behalf of any of
the Acquired Companies to be terminated as of the day prior to the Closing

for, such power of attorney to remain in effect thereafter.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. Parent and Securityholders Agent, and each of their
Affiliates, agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon

access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all
Tax Returns by Parent or the Acquired Companies, the making of any election
relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority and
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any
Tax.

 

(d) _Tax Contests_. Parent shall promptly notify Securityholders Agent in
writing upon receipt of a written notice of any Tax audits or assessments for
which Parent would be entitled to indemnification under Section 9 hereof ("
_Tax Contest Claims_ "); provided that failure to provide such notice shall
not affect Parents right to seek indemnification hereunder unless
Securityholders Agents ability to contest such Tax Contest Claim is
precluded by such failure. Such notice shall include a copy of the relevant
portion of any correspondence received from the relevant Governmental Entity
and shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of such Tax Contest Claim
to the extent known by Parent. Parent and Securityholders Agent shall
cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim.
Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of any issues in any Tax
Contest Claim. The Securityholders Agent shall have the right to participate,
at the expense of the Non-Dissenting Equityholders, in any Tax Contest Claim
if the Tax Contest Claim could result in a claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9 hereof (any such claim, a " _Securityholder Tax Contest Claim_
"); provided that Parent shall not compromise or settle any Securityholder Tax
Contest Claim without obtaining the Securityholders Agents prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne 50% by
Parent and 50% by the Non-Dissenting Equityholders (or from the Escrow Fund
if the Non-Dissenting Equityholders are unable to fund their obligations).
Parent and the Company (and, after the Closing, the Securityholders Agent)
agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. Any payments made to any party
pursuant to Section 9 hereof shall constitute an adjustment of the Merger
Consideration for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the parties on
their Tax Returns to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

(g) _Coordination_. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the
provisions of this Section 4.14 and Section 9, the provisions of this Section
4.14 shall control.

(h) _Certain Actions_. Unless required by Law or as otherwise expressly
provided for in this Agreement, Parent and its Affiliates shall not amend any
Tax Return of, or make or change any Tax election with respect to (including,
without limitation, any election under Code section 338), or initiate any
voluntary disclosure or similar process with respect to, each Acquired
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or take any action that could reasonably
be expected to increase any Tax liability of the Companys securityholders or
any of their Affiliates, including for this purpose, each Acquired Company,
in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the Securityholders Agents
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

4.15 Intellectual Property Matters. On or before the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent an accurate and complete list as of the Closing Date
of all actions that must be taken by the Acquired Companies within 120 days

applications or certificates) for purposes of maintaining, perfecting,
preserving or renewing any Company Registered Intellectual Property.

4.16 Stockholder Approval; Waiver of Dissenters Rights. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of its stockholders to vote
for, consent to and raise no objections against and to waive any dissenters
rights, appraisal rights or similar rights with respect to, the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions.

_Exhibit E_ from each holder of a Company Option and each holder of a Company

of the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee, but also without duplication
of any Damages actually recovered by the Surviving Corporation as an
Indemnitee), Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the
stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Damages as a result of
and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach.

9.3 Limitations.

 

(a) _De Minimis Claims_. No Non-Dissenting Equityholder shall be required to
make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) for any
Damages arising from any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement (or group of related Damages that result from
substantially the same or substantially related circumstances) pursuant to
this Section 9 if the aggregate amount of such Damages or group of related
Damages (as opposed to a Non-Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share thereof)
is less than $25,000 (the " _De Minimis Threshold_ "); if less than the De
Minimis Threshold, then such Damages shall not be subject to indemnity
hereunder and if greater or equal to the De Minimis Threshold, the entire
amount (subject to the other limitations set forth in this Section 9,
including Section 9.3(b)) shall be eligible for indemnity.

(b) _Threshold_. Subject to Section 9.3(c), the Non-Dissenting Equityholders
shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to either
Section 9.2(a)(i) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement or Section 9.2(a)(iii) for inaccuracy in
or failure to calculate properly the items referred to therein until such
time as the total amount of all Damages (including the Damages arising from
such inaccuracy, breach or failure and all other Damages 

 



66  arising from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any representations or
warranties or inaccuracies in or failures to calculate properly, without
duplication) that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by
any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the
Indemnitees has or have otherwise directly or indirectly become subject,
exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") in the aggregate. If the
total amount of such Damages exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the
Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and
reimbursed for the entire amount of such Damages, and not merely the portion
of such Damages exceeding the Threshold Amount.

(c) _Applicability of Threshold_. The limitation set forth in Section
9.3(b) shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other
obligations of any Non-Dissenting Equityholder, subject to the limitations
contained in Sections 9.1 and 9.3 of this Agreement) to Damages resulting
from: (i) any inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the Specified
Representations or (ii) any of the matters referred to in Section 9.2(a)(ii)
and Sections 9.2(a)(iv) through and including 9.2(a)(ix) hereof.

 

(d) _Cap of Escrow Amount; Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to Sections
9.1(d), 9.3(e) and 9.3(f), (i) the Non-Dissenting Equityholders shall not be
liable for Damages resulting from the matters referred to in Section 9.2(a)(i)
or Section 9.2(a)(iii) in excess of the Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ ") and (ii)
the right of the Indemnitees to obtain indemnification from, and only from,
the Escrow Funds pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Section 9
shall be the Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy against any and all Non-
Dissenting Equityholders arising out of this Agreement.

(e) _Applicability of Liability Cap_. The limitations set forth in Section
9.3(d) shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other
obligations of any Non-Dissenting Equityholders, subject to the limitations
contained in Sections 9.1 and 9.3 of this Agreement): (i) to inaccuracies in
or breaches of any of the Specified Representations or (ii) to the matters
referred to in Section 9.2(a)(ii) and Sections 9.2(a)(iv) through and
including 9.2(a)(ix), inclusive; _provided, however_ , that, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Damages resulting from any of the matters referred to in
clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this sentence shall nevertheless count toward the
Cap.

 

(f) _IP Representations Cap_. Subject to Section 10.3, in the absence of
intentional misrepresentation or fraud, (i) prior to the General
Representation Expiration Date, the Non-Dissenting Equityholders shall not be
liable for Damages arising under, relating to or resulting from, directly or
indirectly, any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of, or default
in connection with, any of the IP Representations in excess of the Cap, and
(ii) following the General Representation Expiration Date but prior to the IP
Representation Expiration Date, the maximum liability of any Non-Dissenting
Equityholder under this Agreement for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in
or breach of, or default in connection with, any of the IP Representations
shall not exceed such Non-Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share of such
Damages of an aggregate amount which would equal, in addition to any portion
of the Escrow Amount paid to or subject to a claim by the Indemnitees for a
breach of or default in connection with any of the IP Representations during
the period ending on the General Representation Expiration Date, an
additional twelve and one half percent (12.5%) of the aggregate Merger
Consideration such Non-Dissenting Equityholder received (before deduction of
any applicable Taxes) pursuant to Section 1 (the " _Additional IP Cap_ ");
_provided, however_ , that an Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover Damages
representing all or a portion of the Additional IP Cap resulting from the
misrepresentation or breach of, or default in connection with, any of the
IP Representations only in connection with claims or Legal Proceedings that
arise following the General Representation Expiration Date but prior to the IP
Representation Expiration Date.

 

(g) _Additional Cap_. Subject to Section 10.3, in the absence of intentional
misrepresentation or fraud, the maximum liability of any Non-Dissenting
Equityholder under this Agreement shall not exceed the aggregate Merger
Consideration actually paid to such Non-Dissenting

 



67  Equityholder (before deduction of any applicable Taxes) pursuant to Section
1 (it being understood that there shall be no such limitation on the liability
of any Non-Dissenting Equityholder in the case of any intentional
misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the Non-Dissenting Equityholder
against whom liability is being asserted).

 

(h) _Adjustments for Insurance; Other Limitations_.

 

(i) For purposes of this Section 9, all Damages will be measured net of any
amounts actually recovered (after deducting related costs and expenses) by
the Indemnitee for the Damages for which such indemnification payment is
payable under any insurance policy, warranty or indemnity from any third
party.

 

(ii) No Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover under this Section 9 for lost
profits, indirect, exemplary, special, consequential or punitive damages
unless such Damages are (a) actually awarded, (b) determined by express
written agreement of the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent to be
recoverable under this Section 9, (c) are related to, directly or indirectly,
any Intellectual Property matter, (d) are related to, directly or indirectly,
Sections 9.2(a)(v), (vii), (viii) or (ix) or (e) are related to a breach or
inaccuracy in one or more representations and warranties in Section 2.3.

(i) _No Multiple Claims_. Any Damages for which any Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 9 shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Damages
constituting (i) a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or (ii) a matter for which indemnification is available under
more than one provision of this Agreement.

(j) _Order of Recovery_. All Damages shall be paid, first, out of the Escrow
Funds (based on each Non-Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share) until such
funds are fully exhausted or reserved for pending claims, and second, by the
Non-Dissenting Equityholders, severally (based on each such holders Pro Rata
Share) and not jointly, but only if the Non-Dissenting Equityholders are
obligated to pay for such Damages pursuant to the terms of this Section 9
(including after giving effect to the limitations set forth in Sections 9.1
and 9.3 hereof). The Indemnitees shall be entitled to bring an indemnification
claim directly against one or more of the Non-Dissenting Equityholders to
recover Damages if and to the extent that (i) the Escrow Fund is no longer
available or has been reserved for pending claims and (ii) the Non-Dissenting
Equityholders are obligated to pay for such Damages pursuant to the terms of
this Section 9, including after giving effect to the limitations set forth
in Sections 9.1 and 9.3 hereof; _provided, however_ , that the liability of
any Non-Dissenting Equityholder in such case shall be limited to such Non-
Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share of such Damages.

 

(k) _Effect of Indemnification Payments_. To the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Section 9 shall be treated by all parties as adjustments to the aggregate
consideration paid in the Merger.

9.4 No Contribution. Each Non-Dissenting Equityholder, solely in his, her or
its capacity as such, waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Non-
Dissenting Equityholder shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity
or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against the Surviving
Corporation or any Acquired Company in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other liability to which such Non-Dissenting Equityholder
may become subject pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Effective as of
the Closing, the Securityholders Agent, on behalf of itself and each Non-
Dissenting Equityholder, expressly waives and releases any and all such
rights of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other
claim against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company.
Subject to Section

 



68  9.2(a)(viii), no Non-Dissenting Equityholder waives or releases, and the
Securityholders Agent shall not be deemed to have waived or released, any
rights such Non-Dissenting Equityholder may have in his or her capacity as a
present or former director or officer of the Company, including, without
limitation, any rights arising under Section 4.13 of this Agreement.

 

9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims.

 

(a) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any third party of any
claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against the Surviving Corporation, any
Acquired Company, Parent or any other Person) (each claim and/or Legal
Proceeding, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") with respect to which any Non-
Dissenting Equityholder may become obligated to hold harmless,
indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9
(such Non-Dissenting Equityholder for purposes of this Section 9.5, an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnitee shall with reasonable promptness
notify the Securityholders Agent of such Third Party Claim; _provided,
however,_ that the failure so to notify the Securityholders Agent shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Parties of their obligations under this Agreement,
except to the extent the Securityholders Agent demonstrates that the defense
of such claim or demand is materially prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Securityholders Agent shall have 30 days from receipt of the above
notice from the Indemnitee (as used in this Section 9.5, the " _Notice Period_
") to notify the Indemnitee whether or not the Securityholders
Agent desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, and subject
to the Indemnifying Partys written agreement to accept full responsibility
for indemnification and payment of any Damages with respect to such Third
Party Claim, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, if it is
entitled to assume such defense; _provided_ , that the Indemnitee is hereby
authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or
other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the assumption of defense of any such matters by the Securityholders Agent
shall relate solely to the claim, liability or expense that is subject or
potentially subject to indemnification hereunder; _provided, further_ , that
the option to assume the defense shall not be available to the
Securityholders Agent for Third Party Claims (A) involving criminal or
quasi-criminal allegations, (B) involving the Indemnifying Party or its
Affiliates as a party if counsel to the Indemnitee determines in good faith
that joint representation would give rise to a conflict of interest, (C) in
which matters involving Intellectual Property or Taxes are the subjects of
dispute in such Third Party Claim, (D) where non-monetary relief is sought
that is not merely incidental to monetary relief that is sought, (E) involving
a customer of Parent or any of its Affiliates or (F) that could reasonably be
for an amount in excess of one and one-half (1.5) times the Indemnitees right
to recover from the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Section 9, in each
case for which defense shall be assumed by the Indemnitee with the right to
retain counsel of its choice (at the Indemnifying Partys expense). If the
Securityholders Agent elects to assume the defense of any such Third Party
Claim for which it is entitled to assume the defense, the Indemnitee shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense
thereof. If the Securityholders Agent is prohibited from assuming, or is not
entitled to assume or otherwise elects not to assume, the defense of such
Third Party Claim (or fails to give timely notice to the Indemnitee during the
Notice Period), the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume the defense of such
claim or demand with counsel of its own choice, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. If the Securityholders Agent elects to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected
by the Securityholders Agent without the Indemnitees prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party, the settlement does not include any admission of
liability and each Indemnitee is fully released from all liabilities relating
to such claim or demand. The Indemnifying Party may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such claim or demand in which the Indemnifying
Party receives a release from all liabilities relating to such claim or
demand in connection with a compromise or settlement,

 



69  unless such release also applies to each Indemnitee.

(c) In connection with any Third Party Claim:

(i) all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by or on behalf of an Indemnitee
relating to the defense of such Third Party Claim shall be borne and paid
exclusively by the Indemnifying Parties (if requested by the Indemnitee) if
and to the extent there remain funds available in the Escrow Fund, with such
fees and expenses to be withdrawn exclusively from the Escrow Fund;
_provided, however_ , that the amount of all such fees and expenses so borne
and paid shall be promptly returned to and held in the Escrow Fund pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (or, except as set forth
in Section 9.5(e), distributed directly to the Indemnifying Parties if the
Escrow Fund is no longer available pursuant to the terms hereof and thereof)
within two Business Days after the earlier to occur of (i) the
General Representation Expiration Date, if the Indemnitee has not submitted a
Notice of Claim in accordance with Section 9.6 with respect to such Third
Party Claim by such date, and (ii) the date on which such Third Party Claim is
ultimately determined to not be subject to indemnification by the
Indemnifying Parties under this Section 9; and _provided, further_ , that the
limitations set forth in this Section 9.5(c)(i) shall not apply if and to the
extent that such fees and expenses constitute Damages pursuant to the other
provisions of this Section 9;

(ii) if an Indemnitee is defending such Third Party Claim, each Indemnifying
Party shall make available to Parent or any other Indemnitee any documents and
materials in such Indemnifying Partys possession or control that may be
necessary to the defense of such Third Party Claim; 

(iii) the party defending such Third Party Claim shall keep the
Securityholders Agent or Parent, as applicable, reasonably apprised of the
status of the Third Party Claim and any resulting suit, proceeding or
enforcement action and (ii) shall furnish the Securityholders Agent or
Parent, as applicable with all documents and information that such Person
shall reasonably request and shall consult with such Person prior to acting
on major matters, including settlement discussions; and

(iv) if an Indemnitee is defending such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee
shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that if the Indemnitee settles, adjusts or compromises any
such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Securityholders
Agent, such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall neither be conclusive
evidence of an Indemnifying Partys (including any Non-Dissenting
Equityholders) obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9
hereof for Damages incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Third
Party Claim nor conclusive evidence of the amount of Damages incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Claim.

(d) With respect to any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 9,
the parties shall cooperate in such a manner and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve in full the confidentiality of all confidential
information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection
therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use commercially reasonable
efforts, in respect of any Third Party Claim in which it has assumed or has
participated in the defense, to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law and rules of procedure) and (ii) it will use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all communications between any
parties hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of
any Third Party Claim are effected and/or conducted so as to preserve any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.

(e) Indemnitee shall have the right to withhold and deduct from any Non-
Dissenting Equityholder any sum that is owed to any Indemnitee under this
Section 9 from any amount otherwise

 



70  payable by any Indemnitee to such Non-Dissenting Equityholder pursuant to
the terms of Section 9.5(c)(i).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or in the Escrow
Agreement, in connection with any Third Party Claim, if any Indemnitee
requests that all fees and expenses reasonably incurred by or on behalf of
such Indemnitee relating to the defense of such Third Party Claim be borne and
paid by the Indemnifying Parties, then such Indemnitee shall deliver a notice
(an " _Expense Notice_ ") to the Securityholders Agent and the Escrow Agent.
After delivery of an Expense Notice, the Indemnitees may, in good faith,
submit written notices to the Escrow Agent requesting that any fees and
expenses reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such Indemnitees relating to
the defense of such Third Party Claim be promptly disbursed from the Escrow
Fund to the Indemnitees, and the Escrow Agent shall promptly make such
disbursements. At any time that an Indemnitee is entitled to disbursements
pursuant to one or more Expense Notices, Parent shall confer with the
Securityholders Agent on a quarterly basis with respect to the status of such
Third Party Claim, the fees and expenses that have been disbursed from the
Escrow Fund and Parents good faith estimates of fees and expenses to be
incurred in the following quarter.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
Closing, the Company shall resolve any unpaid Illinois, New Jersey or New York
sales and use Tax liabilities with the appropriate taxing authority in such
State and any and all actions of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection therewith shall not have
any impact on the Non-Dissenting Equityholders indemnification obligations
under this Agreement (which shall remain in full force and effect).

9.6 Indemnification Claim Procedure. Subject to Sections 9.5(c), 9.5(f) and
10.9(c), any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
pursuant to this Section 9 shall be brought and resolved exclusively as
follows:

 

(a) If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or
suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for
which it is or may be entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated
or reimbursed under Section 9 or for which it is or may be entitled to a
monetary remedy (including in the case of a claim based on
intentional misrepresentation or fraud), such Indemnitee may deliver a notice
of claim (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") to the Securityholders Agent or Non-
Dissenting Equityholder. Each Notice of Claim shall: (i) state that such
Indemnitee believes in good faith that such Indemnitee is or may be entitled
to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 or is or may
otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy; (ii) contain a brief description
of the facts and circumstances supporting such Indemnitees claim; and (iii)
if practicable, contain a non-binding, preliminary estimate of the aggregate
amount of the actual and potential Damages that the Indemnitee believes have
arisen and may arise as a result of such facts and circumstances (the
aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by such Indemnitee
from time to time, being referred to as the " _Claimed Amount_ ").

 

(b) During the 30-day period commencing upon delivery by an Indemnitee to the
Securityholders Agent or a Non-Dissenting Equityholder of a Notice of Claim
(the " _Dispute Period_ "), the Securityholders Agent may deliver to the
Indemnitee who delivered the Notice of Claim a written response (the "
_Response Notice_ ") in which the Securityholders Agent: (i) agrees that the
full Claimed Amount is owed to such Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part, but not
all, of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") is owed to the
Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to
such Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause
"(ii)" or "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, such Response Notice shall
also contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting
the Securityholders Agents claim that only a portion or no part of the
Claimed

 



71  Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, as the case may be. Any part of the
Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the
Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Securityholders Agent
asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to
the Indemnitee) is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Contested Amount_ "
(it being understood that the Contested Amount shall be subject to
modification from time to time to reflect any modifications by the Indemnitee
to the Claimed Amount). If a Response Notice is not received by the Indemnitee
prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Securityholders
Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that the full Claimed Amount
is owed to the Indemnitee.

(c) If (i) the Securityholders Agent delivers a Response Notice to the
Indemnitee agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee or
(ii) the Securityholders Agent does not deliver a Response Notice to
the Indemnitee during the Dispute Period, then: (A) if cash remains in the
Escrow Fund (that is not subject to a pending claim), Parent and the
Securityholders Agent shall, within three Business Days following the earlier
of the delivery date of such Response Notice and the expiration date of the
Dispute Period, jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written
notice instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund and (B) if the amount available in the Escrow
Fund (that is not subject to a pending claim) is insufficient for whatever
reason to cover the full Claimed Amount, then, subject to the limitations
provided for in Section 9.3, each Non-Dissenting Equityholder shall, within
10 Business Days following receipt of notice by such Non-Dissenting
Equityholder, pay such Non-Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such shortfall to the Indemnitee (with such payment being made in
substantial compliance with the payment instructions set forth in such
notice).

(d) If the Securityholders Agent delivers a Response Notice to the
Indemnitee during the Dispute Period agreeing that less than the full Claimed
Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, then: (i) if cash remains in the Escrow Fund
(that is not subject to a pending claim), Parent and the Securityholders
Agent shall, within three Business Days following the receipt of such Response
Notice, jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Agreed Amount to the Indemnitee from
the Escrow Fund and (ii) if the amount available in the Escrow Fund (that is
not subject to a pending claim) is insufficient for whatever reason to cover
the full Agreed Amount, then, subject to the limitations provided for
in Section 9.3, each Non-Dissenting Equityholder shall, within 10 Business
Days following receipt of notice by such Non-Dissenting Equityholder, pay such
Non-Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share of the amount of such shortfall
to the Indemnitee (with such payment being made in substantial compliance
with the payment instructions set forth in such notice).

(e) If the Securityholders Agent delivers a Response Notice to the
Indemnitee during the Dispute Period indicating that there is a Contested
Amount, the Securityholders Agent and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good
faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount within 30 days
after the date on which the Securityholders Agent delivers such Response
Notice (or such longer period as the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent
may mutually agree in writing). If the Indemnitee and the Securityholders
Agent resolve such dispute during such period, then their resolution of such
dispute shall be binding on the Securityholders Agent, the Non-Dissenting
Equityholders and such Indemnitee and a settlement agreement stipulating the
amount owed to the Indemnitee (the " _Stipulated Amount_ ") shall be signed by
the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent. If cash remains in the Escrow
Fund (that is not subject to a pending claim), Parent and the
Securityholders Agent shall, within three Business Days following the
execution of such settlement agreement (or such shorter period of time as may
be set forth in the settlement agreement), jointly execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the
Stipulated Amount to the Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund. If the amount
available in the Escrow Fund (that is not subject to a pending claim) is
insufficient for whatever reason to cover the full Stipulated Amount, then,
subject to the limitations

 



72  provided for in Section 9.3, each Non-Dissenting Equityholder shall, within
10 Business Days following the receipt of notice of the execution of such
settlement agreement, pay such Non-Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share
of the amount of such shortfall to the Indemnitee (with such payment being
made in substantial compliance with the payment instructions set forth in such
notice).

 

(f) In the event that the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent fail to
reach a resolution on a Notice of Claim or Contested Amount that is the
subject of a Response Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by either (i) a
written settlement agreement executed by Parent and the Securityholders Agent
within 30 days after the date on which the Securityholders Agent delivers
such Response Notice indicating there is a Contested Amount (or such longer
period as the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent may mutually agree in
writing) (whether it is a matter between the Indemnitee, on the one hand, and
the Securityholders Agent, on the other hand, or it is a matter that is
subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or commenced by a third party
brought against the Indemnitee or any Acquired Company) or (ii) in the absence
of such a written settlement agreement within 30 days following delivery of
the Response Notice by the Securityholders Agent, by litigation between
Parent and the Securityholders Agent or one or more Non-Dissenting
Equityholders in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Section
9.6(f). During the 30-day period following the Response Notice indicating
there is a Contested Amount, the Securityholders Agent and Parent shall act
in good faith to resolve the Contested Amount. Either Parent or the
Securityholders Agent may bring suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware to resolve a Contested Amount to the extent the Securityholders
Agent and Parent are unable to resolve such Contested Amount during the
30-day period contemplated by this Section 9.6(f). The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to act in accordance with any non-appealable decision by a court with
applicable jurisdiction or with the written consent of the Parent and the
Securityholders Agent and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Amount
in accordance therewith. Any Person shall pay its own expenses incurred in
connection with any such suit. Following the delivery of a Notice of
Claim, the Securityholders Agent and its representatives and agents shall be
given all such reasonable access (including electronic access, to the extent
available) as they may reasonably require to the books and records of the
Surviving Corporation and access to such personnel or representatives of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, including but not limited to the individuals
responsible for the matters that are the subject of the Notice of Claim, as
they may reasonably require for the purposes of investigating or resolving
any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries raised in the Notice of
Claim.

(g) Promptly after the General Representation Expiration Date, Parent shall
notify the Securityholders Agent in writing of the amount that Parent
determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all claims made by an
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9.2 that have been asserted, but not resolved
prior to the General Representation Expiration Date (each such claim an "
_Unresolved Claim_ " and such amount, the " _Retained Escrow Amount_ ").
Within 10 Business Days after the General Representation Expiration Date,
Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall, subject to Section 9.6(i),
jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing
the Escrow Agent to release from the balance of the Escrow Fund to (i) the
Payment Agent, for distribution to each Non-Dissenting Stockholder and each
former holder of a Company Warrant, an amount equal to such holders Pro Rata
Share of the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount remaining in the
Escrow Fund as of the General Representation Expiration Date _exceeds_ the
Retained Escrow Amount and (ii) the Surviving Corporation, for distribution to
each former holder of a Company Option or Company RSU, an amount (reduced by
the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable Legal
Requirements with respect to such payments) equal to such holders Pro Rata
Share of the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount remaining in the
Escrow Fund as of the General Escrow Expiration Date _exceeds_ the Retained
Escrow Amount.

(h) Following the General Representation Expiration Date, if any Unresolved
Claim

 



73  is finally resolved, then Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall,
subject to Section 9.6(i), jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
within three Business Days after the final resolution of such Unresolved
Claim and the delivery to the Indemnitee of the amount to be delivered to the
Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 9, a written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund to (i) the
Payment Agent, for distribution to each Non-Dissenting Stockholder and each
former holder of a Company Warrant, an amount equal to such holders Pro Rata
Share of the amount (if any) by which the aggregate amount held in the Escrow
Fund as of the time of such disbursement exceeds the amounts that Parent
determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all remaining Unresolved
Claims (which amounts will continue to be held in the Escrow Fund pursuant to
the terms hereof) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation, for distribution to
each former holder of a Company Option or Company RSU, an amount (reduced by
the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable Legal
Requirements with respect to such payments) equal to such holders Pro Rata
Share of the amount, if any, by which the aggregate the amount (if any) by
which the aggregate amount held in the Escrow Fund as of the time of such
disbursement exceeds the amounts that Parent determines in good faith to be
necessary to satisfy all remaining Unresolved Claims (which amounts will
continue to be held in the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms hereof).

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any amount is due to be released to a particular Non-Dissenting Equityholder
from the Escrow Fund prior to the Payment Compliance Date for such Non-
Dissenting Equityholder, if applicable, Parent and the Securityholders Agent
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Parent the amount that would
otherwise be distributed to such Non-Dissenting Equityholder, Parent shall
retain such amount until the Payment Compliance Date for such Non-Dissenting
Equityholder and Parent shall distribute (or cause the Payment Agent to
distribute) such amount to such Non-Dissenting Equityholder promptly
following such Payment Compliance Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Payment Compliance Date_ " for a particular Non-Dissenting Stockholder or
holder of a Company Warrant means the first date upon which such Non-
Dissenting Equityholder has validly surrendered all Company Stock Certificates
formerly evidencing the Capital Stock held by such Non-Dissenting Stockholder
or all Company Warrants held by such Non-Dissenting Equityholder (or a Lost
Certificate Affidavit relating to the same) in accordance with Section 1.9.



   10. | MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
---|--- 

10.1 Securityholders Agent.

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement in
exchange for Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, the Non-
Dissenting Equityholders irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the agent and true and lawful
attorney in fact of the equityholders (the " _Securityholders  Agent_"),
with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the
Non-Dissenting Equityholders for purposes of executing any documents and
taking any actions that the Securityholders Agent may, in the
Securityholders Agents sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable
or appropriate in connection with any claim for indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement under Section 9\. Shareholder Representative Services LLC
hereby accepts its appointment as Securityholders Agent.

(b) _Authority_. The Non-Dissenting Equityholders grant to the
Securityholders Agent full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge,
certify and file on behalf of such Non-Dissenting Equityholders (in the name
of any or all of the Non-Dissenting Equityholders or otherwise) any and all
documents that the Securityholders Agent may, in his sole discretion,
determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and
containing such provisions as the Securityholders Agent may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as
contemplated by Section

 



74  10.1(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or in any other agreement executed in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby: (i) each Indemnitee shall be entitled to
deal exclusively with the Securityholders Agent on all matters relating to
any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9
and (ii) each Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Non-Dissenting Equityholder by the
Securityholders Agent, and on any other action taken or purported to
be taken on behalf of any Non-Dissenting Equityholder by the Securityholders
Agent, as fully binding upon such Non-Dissenting Equityholder.

 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Non-Dissenting Equityholders recognize and intend
that the power of attorney granted in Section 10.1(a): (i) is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Securityholders
Agent; and (iii) shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of each of the Non-Dissenting Equityholders.

(d) _Replacement_. If the Securityholders Agent shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder,
the Non-Dissenting Equityholders shall (by consent of those Persons entitled
to at least a majority of the Merger Consideration), within 10 days after such
death, resignation, disability or inability, appoint a successor to the
Securityholders Agent (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and
immediately thereafter notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor shall succeed the Securityholders Agent as Securityholders
Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholders Agent at any
time, all references herein to the Securityholders Agent shall be deemed to
refer to the Non-Dissenting Equityholders.

(e) _Expense Fund_. Each Non-Dissenting Equityholder hereby authorizes the
Payment Agent to withhold $400,000 (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ ") from the
amounts otherwise payable by the Payment Agent to the Non-Dissenting
Equityholders pursuant to Section 1.9, with the Payment Agent to withhold from
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each Non-Dissenting
Equityholder and distribute to the Securityholders Agent an amount equal to
each Non-Dissenting Equityholders Pro Rata Share of the Expense Fund Amount.
The Non-Dissenting Equityholders shall hold harmless and indemnify the
Indemnitees from and against any Damages relating to the withholding of the
Expense Fund Amount. The Expense Fund Amount shall be retained by the
Securityholders Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and
obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and any amounts
remaining from the Expense Fund Amount shall be paid by the Securityholders
Agent to the Payment Agent for distribution to the Non-
Dissenting Equityholders (subject to Section 9.6(i)), in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares, at such time as the Securityholders Agent
determines to be appropriate, except that any payment made under this Section
10.(1)(e) with respect to Vested Company Options or Company RSUs shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall pay such
amount (reduced by the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under
applicable Legal Requirements with respect to such payments) to the former
holder thereof. The Non-Dissenting Equityholders shall not receive interest or
other earnings on the Expense Fund Amount and the Non-Dissenting Equityholders
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Securityholders Agent any ownership
right that they may have in any interest that may accrue on the Expense Fund
Amount. The Non-Dissenting Equityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders
Agent is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice.
The Securityholders Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any
loss of principal of the Expense Fund Amount other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund
Amount shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Non-Dissenting Equityholders at the time of Closing. The parties agree
that the Securityholders Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or in
any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund Amount. Any portion
of the Expense Fund Amount that remains undeliverable or unclaimed after six
months of the initial delivery attempt shall promptly be paid to Parent and
handled in the same manner as other unclaimed funds as provided in

 



75  this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

(f) The Securityholders Agent will incur no liability of any kind with
respect to any action or omission by the Securityholders Agent in connection
with the Securityholders Agents services pursuant to this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Securityholders Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders Agent shall be entitled to consult with
counsel and shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the
advice of counsel. The Non-Dissenting Equityholders will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Securityholders Agent from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Securityholders Agents execution and performance of this Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholders Agent, the
Securityholders Agent will reimburse the Non-Dissenting Equityholders the
amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to
such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Securityholders Agent by the Non-Dissenting Equityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholders Agent from (i)
the funds in the Expense Fund and (ii) subject to the prior rights and claims
of the Indemnitees, the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining
unclaimed amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Non-Dissenting
Equityholders; _provided_ , that while this section allows the
Securityholders Agent to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds,
this does not relieve the Non-Dissenting Equityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Securityholders Agent from seeking any remedies
available to it against the Non-Dissenting Equityholders at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Securityholders Agent be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Non-Dissenting Equityholders or otherwise. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the limitations on liability of the Non-Dissenting
Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provide to the Securityholders Agent under this
Section 10.1(f). The Non-Dissenting Equityholders acknowledge and agree that
the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

 

10.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents,
and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

10.3 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Intentional Misrepresentation or Fraud.
The liability of any Person under Section 9 will be in addition to, and not
exclusive of, any other liability that such Person may have at law or in
equity based on such Persons intentional misrepresentation or fraud.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none
of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions set
forth in Section 9, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of
any right or remedy which such party may have at law or in equity based on any
other Persons intentional misrepresentation or fraud, nor will any such
provisions limit, or be deemed to limit: (a) the amounts of recovery sought or
awarded in any such claim for intentional misrepresentation or fraud; (b) the
time period during which a claim for intentional misrepresentation or fraud
may be brought; or (c) the recourse which any such party may seek against
another Person with respect to a claim for intentional misrepresentation or
fraud.

 



76 10.4 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Sections 1.5, 9 and 10.1, each party to
this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees, costs and expenses that have been
incurred or that are incurred in the future by such party in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees, costs and expenses incurred
by such party in connection with or by virtue of: (a) the negotiation,
preparation and review of this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule)
and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents
delivered or to be delivered in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions; (b) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice
required to be made or given in connection with any of the Contemplated
Transactions, and the obtaining of any Consent required to be obtained
in connection with any of such transactions; and (c) the consummation of the
Merger.

10.5 Attorneys Fees. If any action, suit or other legal proceeding relating
to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is
brought against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to
any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received: (a) if delivered by hand, when

jurisdiction of such court, that such action, suit or legal proceeding has

legal proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of
this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court.

 

(c) _Indemnification Claims_. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or

any claim based upon

 



78  intentional misrepresentation or fraud relating to this Agreement or the

doubt and without limiting any portion of Section 10.9(b): (i) at the option

accordance with Section 9.6 and (ii) nothing in this Section 10.9(c) or

approval shall be void and without legal effect; provided that prior to the
Closing, Parent or Merger Sub may assign all or any of its rights
and obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, provided that

any such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related
action or Legal Proceeding.

10.12 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived

remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.

10.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

10.14 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered: (a) prior to the Closing Date, on behalf of the Company, Parent,

behalf of Parent and the Securityholders Agent (acting exclusively for and
on behalf of all of the Non-Dissenting Equityholders).

 



79 10.15 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to
be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or
otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

 

10.16 Parties in Interest. Except for the provisions of Section 4.13 and
Sections 9 and 10, none of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to

assigns (if any).

 

10.17 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however_ , that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of (a) the
Effective Time or (b) the date on which such Confidentiality Agreement is
terminated or expires in accordance with its terms.

10.18 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule is intended only to qualify
the representations and warranties of the Acquired Companies contained in
Section 2 of the Agreement, and will not be deemed to expand in any way the
scope or effect of any of such representations or warranties. The Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered
and lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement, and the
information disclosed in any numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to
relate to and to qualify only the particular representation or warranty set
forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered section or subsection of this
Agreement, except to the extent that such information is cross-referenced in
another part of the Disclosure Schedule, and elsewhere in the Disclosure
Schedule if it is reasonably clear, upon a reading of such disclosure alone
(without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the
matter disclosed and without any reference to any agreement or document
disclosed), that the disclosure is applicable to such other section(s) or
subsection(s). The mere listing of a document or other item in, or attachment
of a copy thereof to, the Disclosure Schedule will not be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made in this Agreement
(unless the representation or warranty pertains directly to the existence of
the document or other item itself). Certain information set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule is included solely for informational purposes and may not
be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The disclosure of any
information shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such
information is required to be disclosed in connection with the representations
and warranties made by the Acquired Companies in this Agreement or that such
information is material, nor shall such information be deemed to establish a
standard of materiality, nor shall it be deemed an admission of any liability
of, or concession as to any defense available to, any Acquired Company.

10.19 No Tax Advice. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that it has
not received and is not relying upon Tax advice from any other party hereto,
and that it has and will continue to consult its own advisors with respect to
Taxes.

 

10.20 Provisions Respecting Legal Representation. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
members, partners, officers and employees, that Latham and Watkins LLP may serve
as counsel to each and any Person that is a securityholder of the Company as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (individually and collectively,
the " _Holder Group_ "), or the Securityholders Agent, on the one hand, and
the Company, on

 



80  the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Existing Representation_ "), and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Latham and Watkins LLP (or
any successor) may serve as counsel to the Holder Group or any director,
member, partner, officer or employee of the Holder Group, in connection with
any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
the Existing Representation, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents
thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom.

10.21 Construction.

 

(a) _Gender; Etc_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context
requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders.

 

(b) _Ambiguities_. The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to
the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party
shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) _Including_. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."
