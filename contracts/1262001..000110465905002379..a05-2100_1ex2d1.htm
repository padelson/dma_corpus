 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 19, 2005 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among iStar Financial Inc., a Maryland corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Flash Acquisition Company LLC, a Maryland limited liability
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Subsidiary_ "), and
Falcon Financial Investment Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust
(the " _Company_ ").

  



  

 **BACKGROUND**

  

 ** **

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Subsidiary and the
board of trustees of the Company have approved, and deemed advisable and in
the best interests of its respective shareholders or members, the acquisition
of the Company by Parent upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent, Subsidiary and the
Company have proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Subsidiary shall commence an offer (as amended or
supplemented in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase
for cash all of the outstanding common shares of beneficial interest, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company, including restricted shares (the "
_Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $7.50 (subject to any applicable
withholding), net to the seller in cash (such price, or such higher price per
Share as may be paid in the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Subsidiary and the
board of trustees of the Company have each approved this Agreement and the
merger of Subsidiary with and into the Company following the consummation of
the Offer (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, whereby each Share outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2), other than the Shares
owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Subsidiary and Dissenting Shares,
will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price;

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of trustees of the Company has granted Parent and
Subsidiary an exception to the Ownership Limit as defined in the Companys
Articles of Amendment and Restatement of Declaration of Trust, as on file
with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "
_SDAT_ ") on the date of this Agreement (the " _Declaration of Trust_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of trustees of the Company has resolved to recommend that
the holders of Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and has
approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger; and

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to Parents and Subsidiarys willingness to
enter into this Agreement, (a) Parent, Subsidiary and certain trustees and
officers of the Company have entered into an agreement (the " _Shareholders
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which those persons have agreed to tender their
Shares in response to the Offer and to vote their Shares in favor of the
Merger and against any competing transaction, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Shareholders Agreement, and certain of those
persons have agreed to resign as trustees of the Company upon request of
Parent following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, (b) certain of
the Companys executives have entered into employment agreements with Parent
which will become effective upon Subsidiarys acquisition of more than 50% of
the outstanding Shares (on a fully diluted basis, excluding any Shares
issuable pursuant to the Share Option Agreement), (c) Parent, Subsidiary and
the Company have entered into a Share Option Agreement (the " _Share Option
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which the Company has granted Subsidiary an option
to purchase authorized but unissued Shares, subject to certain conditions,
and (d) Parent and

  

   

     
   

  



  

Company have entered into an amendment to the Warehouse Line which was a
material inducement to the Companys obligation to enter into this Agreement
(the " _Warehouse Amendment_ ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I**

  



  

 **THE OFFER**

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and so long as none of the
events or circumstances set forth in subsections (a) through (e) of _Annex A_
hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Parent shall cause Subsidiary
as promptly as practicable (and in any event on or before January 31, 2005)
to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) the Offer at the Offer Price. The obligations of Subsidiary to accept
for payment and to pay for Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be subject solely to
those conditions set forth in _Annex A_. It is agreed that the conditions to
the Offer set forth on _Annex A_ are for the benefit of Subsidiary and may be
asserted only by Subsidiary and Subsidiary expressly reserves the right, in
its sole discretion, to waive any such condition; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that without the prior consent of the Company, Subsidiary shall not waive
the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Annex A_ ). The initial expiration date
of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") shall be the 20th business
day following the commencement of the Offer.

  



  

(b) Subsidiary expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
modify the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without the prior consent of the Company, no modification or change may be
made which (i) decreases the Offer Price (except as permitted by this
Agreement); (ii) changes the form of consideration payable in the Offer
(other than by adding consideration); (iii) changes the Minimum Condition;
(iv) reduces or limits the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer; (v)
changes the conditions to the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the
Shares; (vi) imposes additional conditions to the Offer, (vii) extends the
Offer except as provided in the next sentence, or (viii) makes any other
change which is adverse to the holders of the Shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Subsidiary may, without the consent of the Company, (i) if at the
then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions
to Subsidiarys obligations to accept for payment and pay for Shares shall
not be satisfied or waived, extend and re-extend the Offer on one or more
occasions for such period as is reasonably necessary to permit such
conditions to be satisfied; (ii) extend and re-extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer; and (iii) extend and re-extend the Offer on one or
more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than 20 business days
beyond the latest Expiration Date that would otherwise be permitted under
clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence if, as of such date, the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied but less than 90% of the outstanding Shares (on
a fully diluted basis, excluding any Shares issuable pursuant to the Share
Option Agreement) have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn;
_provided_ that Parent and Subsidiary irrevocably waive (A) the conditions to
the Offer set forth in subsections (b), (e) and (f) of Annex A and agree not
to assert such conditions as a basis for not consummating the Offer and (B)
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(i), (iii)
and (iv).  Subject to the terms and the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, as soon as practicable after expiration of the Offer, Subsidiary
shall accept for payment and pay for, and Parent shall cause Subsidiary to
accept for payment and pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subsidiary may in its
sole discretion elect to provide for a subsequent offering period pursuant

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

to, and on the terms required by, Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (" _Exchange Act_ ").

  



  

(c) At the request of the Company, Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause
Subsidiary to, extend the Offer until such date as the conditions set forth
in Annex I have been satisfied; _provided_ that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied before the Outside Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
require Subsidiary to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

  



  

(d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Subsidiary shall
file with the SEC with respect to the Offer a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and
including all exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") which will on the date
filed with the SEC and the date first published, sent or given to the
Companys shareholders comply in all material respects with the provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and any other
applicable U.S. federal securities laws, and will contain the offer
to purchase relating to the Offer and form of the related letter of
transmittal (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to
which the Offer shall be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto and including the exhibits thereto, are referred to herein
collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "). Subsidiary shall cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by the U.S. federal securities laws. Parent shall deliver copies of
the proposed forms of the Offer Documents to the Company in advance of filing
with the SEC and the commencement of the Offer and shall provide a reasonable
opportunity for review and comment by the Company and its counsel. The Offer
Documents shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.  To the
extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, the Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any amendments and
supplements to the initial Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC
or dissemination to the Companys shareholders. Parent shall promptly provide
the Company and its counsel any comments, written or oral, that Subsidiary,
Parent or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of any such comments, and provide
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
preparation of responses to SEC comments. Each of Parent, Subsidiary and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and Parent and Subsidiary further agree to take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the
other Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to the shareholders
of the Company, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.
S. federal securities laws.

under Title 8 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated

Law (the " _MGCL_ ") or any provisions of the Companys Declaration of Trust
(other than Section 7.2.1(a)(iv) of the

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

Companys Declaration of Trust), that might otherwise apply to the Offer or
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Shareholders Agreement and (vii) adopted resolutions providing an
exception for Parent and Subsidiary to the Ownership Limit as defined in
Section 7.1 of the Declaration of Trust. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendations of the Companys
board of trustees described in this Section 1.2(a).

  



  

(b) The Company shall file with the SEC on the date of the commencement of
the Offer a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") which will on the date filed with the SEC
and the date first published, sent or given to the Companys shareholders
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and any other applicable U.S. federal
securities laws, and that, subject to Section 6.2(b), will contain the
recommendations of the Companys board of trustees referred to in subsection
(a) above, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the Companys
shareholders as and to the extent required by the federal securities laws.
The Company shall deliver the proposed forms of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent
and its counsel in advance of the commencement of the Offer for review and
comment by Parent and its counsel prior to the commencement of the Offer. The
Schedule 14D-9 shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any amendments and supplements to the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
their filing with the SEC or dissemination to the Companys shareholders. The
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel any comments that the Company or
its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of any such comments. Each of the
Company, Parent and Subsidiary shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause such Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Companys shareholders, in each case, as and
to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Shareholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the
Company shall promptly furnish to, or cause to be furnished to, Parent and
Subsidiary mailing labels, security position listings, a list of non-
objecting beneficial owners and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of
a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date (to the extent available), together with all other relevant information
in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of
Shares and shall furnish Parent and Subsidiary with such additional
information and assistance as Parent, Subsidiary or their respective agents
may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and
beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable law,
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger
(including, without limitation, the solicitation of shareholder
votes), Parent and Subsidiary shall, and shall cause each of their agents to,
hold the information contained in any of such labels and lists in confidence,
use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and,
if this Agreement is terminated, will, upon request, deliver, and will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver to the
Company or destroy, all copies of such information or extracts therefrom then
in their possession or under their control.

  



  

Section 1.4 _Trustees; Section 14(f)_.

  



  

(a) Effective upon Subsidiarys purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of trustees as determined
by Parent, rounded up to the next whole number, for election or appointment
to the board of trustees of the Company as will give Parent representation on
the board of trustees of the Company equal to the product of (i) the total
number of

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

trustees on the board of trustees of the Company (giving effect to the
increase in the size of such board pursuant to this Section 1.4) and (ii) a
fraction equal to the number of Shares beneficially owned by Subsidiary and
Parent (including Shares so accepted for payment) divided by the number of
Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, upon request of Parent, the
Company shall take all action reasonably requested by Parent to cause such
designees of Parent and Subsidiary to be so elected or appointed at such
time, including increasing the size of the board and seeking resignations of
incumbent trustees. At such time, the Company shall, if reasonably requested
by Parent, cause persons designated by Parent to constitute at least the same
percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Companys board
of trustees of (i) each committee of the Companys board of trustees; (ii)
each board of directors (or similar body) of each subsidiary of the Company;
and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case
only to the extent permitted by the rules of The Nasdaq National Market ("
_Nasdaq_ ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective upon Subsidiarys
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, and prior to the time that any
designee of Parent becomes a trustee on the Companys board of trustees, the
Company shall, if requested by Parent, permit up to three individuals
designated by Parent (the " _Parent Observers_ ") to attend and observe all
meetings of the Companys board of trustees or any committee of the Companys
board of trustees, subject to a Parent Observers execution of a reasonable
confidentiality agreement regarding confidential information of the Company.
 The Company shall give the Parent Observers notice of all such meetings at
the same time notice is provided or delivered to members of the
Companys board of trustees. Any materials that are sent to the Companys
trustees prior to a meeting of the Companys board of trustees shall be sent
simultaneously by the Company to the Parent Observers. The Parent Observers
shall have no right to vote or exercise any other rights of a trustee at any
meeting attended pursuant to this Section 1.4(a).

  



  

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Companys
board of trustees shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its officers and trustees and Parents designees,
as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis the information with respect to
Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that, if Parents designees are elected to the
board of trustees of the Company, such board of trustees shall have, at all
times prior to the Effective Time, at least two trustees who are trustees on
the date of this Agreement and who are not officers, employees or affiliates
of the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries (it being
understood that for purposes of this sentence, a trustee or director of the
Company or Parent shall not be deemed an affiliate of the Company solely as a

Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of any stock or other equity ownership interest of Parent, Subsidiary
or the Company:

  



  

(a) Each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except as
otherwise provided in this Section 3.1 and in Section 3.7 hereof and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price. All such Shares, when so converted, no longer shall be outstanding and
automatically shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate evidencing any such Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Offer Price
per share therefor, without interest and subject to applicable withholding
tax, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.3.

  



  

(b) Each Share, if any, owned by Parent, Subsidiary or any of their
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Each outstanding membership interest of Subsidiary shall be converted
into one common share of beneficial interest of the Surviving Company.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Surrender and Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) No later than two business days prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Company
to deposit with the Paying Agent cash in amounts and at the times necessary
for the

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

payment of the merger consideration as provided in Section 3.1 upon surrender
of certificates formerly evidencing Shares in the manner provided in Section
3.2. Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent (it being understood that any and all interest or
income earned on funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be turned over to Parent).

  



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Shares (the "
_Company Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price pursuant to Section 3.1 (i) a letter of transmittal
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Company Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and

transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent shall reasonably
require, the holder of such Company Certificates shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Offer Price for each Share formerly evidenced
thereby, in accordance with Section 3.1(a), and the Company Certificates so
surrendered shall be canceled.  Until surrendered as provided in this Section
3.2, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Offer
Price for each Share evidenced thereby. No interest will be paid or accrue
on any amounts payable upon surrender of any Company Certificate.

  



  

(c) Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash and any documents in its
possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the
Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Company
Certificate may surrender such Company Certificate to the Surviving Company
or Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Offer Price, payable upon due
surrender of their Company Certificates without any interest thereon.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent and Surviving Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Shares such
amounts as Parent or Surviving Company is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other provision of federal, state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or Surviving Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Certificates shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, except for the right to receive
the Offer Price pursuant to Section 3.1, without interest. All cash paid upon
the surrender of the Company Certificates in accordance with this Article III
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly evidenced by such Company Certificates. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and no transfer of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective
Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company
Certificates formerly evidencing Shares are presented to the Surviving
Company, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Offer Price in
accordance with this Article III.

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

Section 3.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates_. If any Company
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond or other surety in such amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such Company
Certificate, and subject to such other reasonable conditions as Parent may
impose, the Paying Agent shall deliver the Offer Price pursuant to
Section 3.1 in respect of the Shares evidenced by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificate.

  



  

Section 3.6 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Subsidiary, the Company,
the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Company Certificates
shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any of the merger
consideration would otherwise escheat or become the property of
any Governmental Authority), any amounts payable in respect thereof shall, to
the extent permitted by law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest on any person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Transferred Company Certificates_. If any payment under this
Article III is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
applicable Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Company
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of such Company Certificate surrendered or such
person shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Restricted Shares_. The Company has taken all necessary
action, including obtaining any required consents or amendments to the
Companys Equity Incentive Plan, to permit holders of outstanding restricted
common shares of beneficial interest issued pursuant to the Companys Equity
Incentive Plan to participate in the Offer and be treated in the Merger on
the same terms and conditions as all other holders of unrestricted Shares.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that appraisal rights are available under the REIT Law and the MGCL,
any outstanding Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") held by a Dissenting
Shareholder shall not be converted into the Offer Price but shall become the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the REIT Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a Dissenting Shareholder who, after the Effective Time, withdraws his
demand or fails to perfect or otherwise loses his right of appraisal,
pursuant to the REIT Law, shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest. As used in
this Agreement, " _Dissenting Shareholder_ " means any record holder or
beneficial owner of Shares who is entitled to demand and receive payment of
the fair value of such holders shares pursuant to Section 8.501.1(j) of the
REIT Law and Section 3-202 of the MGCL and who does not vote for the Merger
and complies with all provisions of the MGCL (including all provisions of
Section 3-203 of the MGCL) concerning the right of holders of Shares to
dissent from the Merger and obtain fair value for their shares.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal pursuant to the applicable provisions of the REIT Law and the MGCL
received by the Company, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the REIT Law and

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

the MGCL and received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and direct the conduct of all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the REIT Law and
the MGCL.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, or
settle, or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such demands for
appraisal.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute
and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Subsidiary, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

(nor, to the knowledge of the Company does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice would result in a violation
or breach of, or constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation, acceleration or loss of benefits, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries) under any contract to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for
violations, breaches or defaults that would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

  



  

Section 4.11 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension
granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so).  Each such Tax
Return is accurate and complete in all material respects. The Company and
each of its subsidiaries has paid (or the Company has paid on its behalf),
all Taxes shown on such returns as required to be paid.  All Taxes which the
Company or its subsidiaries are required by law to withhold or collect,
including Taxes required to have been withheld in connection with amounts
paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder
or other third party and sales, gross receipts and use taxes, have been duly
withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the
proper governmental entities within the time period prescribed by law. The
most recent audited financial statements contained in the Company Filed SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by the
Company and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements. The Company and each of its
subsidiaries has established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to
establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves that are adequate
for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and payable. Since December
31, 2003, the Company has incurred no liability for any material Taxes, other
than Taxes that it has paid, under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the
Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5, or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6 including, without limitation, any material Tax
arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the
Code, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business
and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales
of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a risk that any material Tax described in the preceding
sentences will be imposed upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is the subject of any audit,
examination, or other proceeding in respect of Taxes; to the knowledge of the
Company, no audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of Taxes
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries is being considered by any
Tax authority; and no audit, examination or proceeding in respect of Taxes
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries has occurred.
No deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or
to the knowledge of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, proposed) against
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing
authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its subsidiaries does
not file Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be subject to
taxation and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any Taxes have
been granted and remain in effect or are

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

pending. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or its
subsidiaries except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due.

  



  

(b) The Company (A) for each taxable year beginning with its taxable year
ended on December 31, 2003 and ending at the time immediately prior to the
Effective Time, has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment
trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of the Code and has satisfied the
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (B) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, consistent with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective Time and (C) has
not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to
result in the loss of its qualification as a REIT, and no challenge to the
Companys qualification as a REIT is pending or to the Companys knowledge is
or has been threatened. Each, direct or indirect, subsidiary of the Company
which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has since
its acquisition by the Company (A) (i) been classified for federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an
association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded
partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is
treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes under Section
7704(a) of the Code, or (ii) has elected to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes and has elected with
the Company to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company
pursuant to Section 856(l) of the Code, and (B) not owned any assets
(including, without limitation, securities) that would cause the Company to
violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each subsidiary of the Company which is
a corporation, and each other issuer of securities in which the Company
holds securities (within the meaning of Section 856(c) of the Code but
excluding securities of issuers as described in Section 856(m) of the Code)
having a value of more than 10 percent of the total value of the outstanding
securities of such issuer, has since its acquisition by the Company been a
REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a
taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code or otherwise
qualified as a "real estate asset" within the meaning of Section 856(c)(5)(B)
of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries holds any asset
the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of
the Code as announced in IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-5 or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6.

  



  

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company does not have any earnings
and profits attributable to it or any other corporation in any non-REIT year
within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.

  



  

(d) To the Companys knowledge, as of the date hereof, the Company (i) is a
"domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the
Code and (ii) is not nor has it been at any time during the specified period
in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code a "United States Real Property
Holding Corporation" as that term is defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code.

  



  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any Tax
allocation or sharing agreement. None of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries has distributed stock of any other person or has had its stock
distributed by another person in a transaction that was purported or intended
to be governed by Section 355 of the Code.

  



  

(f) The Company does not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other
than the Company and its subsidiaries and the Companys subsidiaries do not
have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than the Company and
its subsidiaries (A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (B) as a transferee or
successor, (C) by contract or (D) otherwise.

  



  

(g) The Company and its subsidiaries have disclosed to the IRS all positions
taken on their federal income Tax Returns which could give rise to a
substantial understatement of Tax under

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

Section 6662 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or are parties to an
agreement that could obligate them to make any payments that would not be
deductible under Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

  



  

(h) To the knowledge of the Company as of the Closing Date, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any understanding or
arrangement described in Section 6111(c), Section 6111(d) or Section
6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the Code, or has "participated in a potentially abusive
tax transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4.

local or foreign income, gross receipts, property, recording, stamp, sales,
use, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll, withholding,
alternative or add on minimum, ad valorem, environmental, transfer or excise
tax, or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or other
like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever, together with any
interest, penalty, additions thereto, whether disputed or not, or additional
amount imposed by any governmental authority or any obligation to pay Taxes
imposed on any entity for which a party to this Agreement is liable as a
result of any indemnification provision or other contractual obligation, and
(ii) " _Tax Return_ " means any return, declaration, report or similar
statement required to be filed with respect to any Tax (including any

Code has been the subject of a determination letter from the Internal Revenue

ERISA. Each Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without material

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, trustees, directors, employees, representatives and
agents to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties
that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and request the
return or destruction of all confidential information regarding the Company
and its subsidiaries provided to any such persons on or prior to the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreements or
otherwise.  The Company shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and
its and their respective officers, trustees, directors, employees,
representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or take
any other action designed or reasonably likely to facilitate or encourage,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations (including by way of furnishing information)
regarding any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any
time prior to the Control Date, a majority of the board of trustees of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and
the Company Financial Advisor or other financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation selected by the Company, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal

  



  



  

26   

     
   

  



  

the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal that was not solicited
subsequent to the date hereof, and subject to compliance with this Section
6.2, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a
confidentiality and standstill agreement no less restrictive on the other
party than the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in discussions
or negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.2, neither the board of trustees of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify, the approval or recommendation by
such board of trustees or such committee of the Offer or the Merger of this
Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend or take no position with respect to, or

any Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any agreement

6.2(a)).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the Control Date the
board of trustees of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel and the Company Financial Advisor or other financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation selected by the Company, that
such a Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of
trustees of the Company may, if such Superior Proposal was not solicited
subsequent to the date hereof, (x) withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Offer or the Merger or this Agreement or (y) subject to
the provisions of Section 8.1(d) hereof, terminate this Agreement, but in
each such case only at a time that is after the fifth business day following
delivery of written notice to Parent advising Parent that the board of
trustees of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
person making such Superior Proposal, and only if the Company is in
compliance with this Section 6.2.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal, offer or expression of interest by any third party
relating to a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or any purchase of more than
20% of the consolidated assets of the Company (including the shares and
assets of its subsidiaries) or the Shares or the issuance of any securities
(or rights to acquire securities) of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company, or any similar transaction, or any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Any material modification of a Takeover Proposal (including any
modification of the economic terms) shall constitute a new Takeover Proposal.
For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide
Takeover Proposal for a transaction in which all of the shares or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company would be acquired by a third
party, including by merger, consolidation or other business combination on
terms that a majority of the board of trustees of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and the Company Financial
Advisor or other financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
selected by the Company) would be more favorable to the Companys
shareholders, from a financial point of view, than the Offer and the Merger
(taking into account any changes to the Offer and the Merger proposed by
Parent in response to the receipt by the Company of such Superior Proposal)
and which is not subject to any material contingency, including any
contingency related to financing, unless, the board of trustees of the
Company determines in good faith that such contingency is reasonably capable
of being satisfied, and that is otherwise reasonably capable of
being consummated in a timely fashion.

  



  

(d) The Company shall immediately advise Parent orally and in writing of any
request for information or of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal and the identity of the
person making such request or Takeover Proposal. The Company will promptly
(but in any event within 24 hours) inform Parent of any material change in
the details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request
or Takeover Proposal.

  



  

27   

     
   

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the board of trustees of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor its board of trustees
nor any committee thereof shall, except as specifically permitted by Section
6.2(b), withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify, its
position with respect to the Offer and the Merger or this Agreement or
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, a Takeover
Proposal.

  



  

(f) The Company agrees that the Company, its subsidiaries and any of the
officers, directors, and trustees of the Company or its subsidiaries shall,

employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of the Company Subsidiaries) to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, promptly request each person that
has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration
of a possible Takeover Proposal to return (or, if required under the
provisions of the confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
confidential information previously furnished to such person. The Company
will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, promptly inform its and their
trustees, directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2.

accountants, financial advisors, consultants and other
representatives (together, its " _Representatives_ ") with full access, upon

accountants, properties (including for the purpose of environmental testing
to the extent permitted by applicable leases) and facilities, of the Company
and its subsidiaries and the books and records relating to the Company and
its subsidiaries and (ii) furnish Parent and its Representatives with all
such information and data (including copies of contracts and other books
and records) concerning the Company and its subsidiaries and operations of
the Company and its subsidiaries as Parent or any of such
Representatives reasonably may request in connection with such investigation.
All such information shall be kept confidential by Parent and its
Representatives in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of December 9, 2004, between Parent and the Company (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

Section 6.4 _Notice Obligations_. From time to time prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall notify Parent in writing with respect to any matter
hereafter arising or any information obtained after the date hereof that, if
existing, occurring or known at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or that is necessary to complete or correct any information in such
schedule or in any representation and warranty of the Company that has been
rendered inaccurate thereby or that would cause a condition to the
closing hereof not to be satisfied, _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of Parent
under this Agreement. The Company shall promptly inform Parent of (i) any
claim by a third party that a contract has been breached, is in default, may
not be renewed or that a consent would be required as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any debt asset of the
Company, including, to the knowledge of the Company, any debt asset
contributed or sold by the Company or a subsidiary to the securitization
vehicle, that becomes more than 60 days past due or delinquent and any debt
asset held in any of the Companys securitizations which the Company is
required to re-acquire on account of default, breach of representations or
otherwise and (iii) any notice by a rating agency that any of the

  



  

28   

     
   

  



  

Companys securitizations have been downgraded or placed on credit watch for
possible downgrade. The Company will consult with Parent a reasonable time
prior to making publicly available its financial results or filing any
document with the SEC.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. The Company and Parent each shall comply as promptly as
practicable with any other laws of any Governmental Authority that are

other person in connection with such transactions is necessary.  The Company

with any such inquiry or request (and, unless precluded by law, provide
copies of any such communications that are in writing).

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall

promptly as practicable, including by defending against any lawsuits, actions
or proceedings, judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or

any preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, stay or other
legal restraint or prohibition entered or imposed by any court or other
Governmental Authority that is not yet final and nonappealable vacated or
reversed.

  



  

(c) The Company and Parent will cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, approvals and waivers required by third persons so that all Company
Permits and contracts of the Company and its subsidiaries will remain in full
force and effect after the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) At any time after Subsidiary shall have accepted for payment and paid for
all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to comply
with the provisions of Sections 856(a)(5) and 856(b) of the Code.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any of their respective
businesses or assets (including, following the Effective Time, any of the
businesses or assets of the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries), or to

the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries), (ii) neither any party hereto
nor their respective subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that
would, or could reasonably be expected to, substantially impair the benefits
expected, as of the date of this Agreement, to be realized by Parent from
consummation of the Merger and (iii) no party to

  



  

29   

     
   

  



  

this Agreement shall be required to waive any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article VII as they apply to such party to this Agreement,
except as provided in Section 1.1.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Subsidiary agree that all rights to indemnification for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former trustees, directors or officers (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") of the Company and its subsidiaries as provided in their
respective declarations of trust, certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
similar organizational documents), shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  



  

(b) (i) In addition to the rights provided in Section 6(a) above, in the
event that any officer, director or trustee of the Company or any of the
Companys subsidiaries (the " _Indemnification Parties_ ") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including without
limitation, actions by or on behalf of securityholders, (each, a "
_Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer,
employee, director or trustee of the Company or any of the Companys
subsidiaries or any action or omission by such individual in his capacity as
such (including any action or omission occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), Parent and Subsidiary and their respective successors
and assigns (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, from and after the
Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent
permitted by applicable law, each Indemnification Party against any losses,
claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable documented attorneys
fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
accordance herewith in connection with any such Proceeding.

  



  

(ii) Any Indemnification Party proposing to assert the right to be
indemnified under this Section 6(b) shall, promptly after receipt of notice
of commencement of any action against such Indemnification Party in respect
of which a claim is to be made under this Section 6(b) against the
Indemnifying Parties, notify the Indemnifying Parties of the commencement of
such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of
the Indemnifying Parties except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability to defend such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation; and _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that, in the case of any Proceeding pending, to the knowledge of
the Company, at the Control Time or Effective Time, the Company shall notify
Parent pursuant to this Section 6(b) prior to the Control Time or Effective
Time, as the case may be.

  



  

(iii) If any such action is brought against any of the Indemnification
Parties and such Indemnification Parties notify the Indemnifying Parties of
its commencement, the Indemnifying Parties will be entitled to participate in
and, to the extent that they elect by delivering written notice to such
Indemnification Parties promptly after receiving notice of the commencement
of the action from the Indemnification Parties, to assume the defense of the
action and after notice from the Indemnifying Parties to the Indemnification
Parties of their election to assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties
will not be liable to the Indemnification Parties for any legal or other
expenses of their counsel except as provided below. If the Indemnifying
Parties assume the defense, the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to
settle such action without the consent of the Indemnification Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnifying Parties, in the defense of any
such action shall, except with the consent of the Indemnification Parties,
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (A) does
not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnification Parties of a full, unconditional release
from all liability with respect to such action, or (B) contains obligations
of such Indemnification Party other than with respect to the payment of
money.

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

(iv) The Indemnification Parties will have the right to employ their own
counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such
counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnification Parties unless (A) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnification Parties has been authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (B) the Indemnification Parties have
reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel to the Indemnification
Parties) that there may be legal defenses available to them that are
different from or in addition to and inconsistent with those available to the
Indemnifying Parties, (C) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on
advice of counsel to the Indemnification Parties) between the Indemnification
Parties and the Indemnifying Parties (in which case the Indemnifying Parties
will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the
Indemnification Parties) or (D) the Indemnifying Parties have not in fact
employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable
time (not to exceed 30 days) after receiving notice of the commencement of
the action from the Indemnification Parties, in each of which cases, the
reasonable documented fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will
be at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties and shall promptly be paid by
each Indemnifying Party within 20 days of receipt by the Indemnifying Parties
of notice and documentation that such fees and expenses are due and payable.

  



  

(v) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.6 to the contrary,
the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to advance any expenses or
costs prior to receipt of (A) an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnification Party to repay any expenses advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that the Indemnification Party is not entitled to be
indemnified against such expense pursuant to the last sentence of this
Section 6(b) and (B) such other representations as may be required by law. It
is understood that the Indemnifying Parties shall not, in connection with any
Proceeding or Proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the
reasonable documented fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one
separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for
all such Indemnification Parties unless (x) the employment of more than one
counsel has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Parties, (y) any
of the Indemnification Parties have reasonably concluded (based on advice of
counsel to the Indemnification Parties) that there may be legal defenses
available to them that are different from or in addition to and inconsistent
with those available to other Indemnification Parties or (z) a conflict or
potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the Indemnification
Parties) between any of the Indemnification Parties and the other
Indemnification Parties, in each case of which the Indemnifying Parties shall
be obligated to pay the reasonable documented fees and expenses of such
additional counsel or counsels on the same basis as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Indemnifying Parties (A) shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without their prior written consent and (B) shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnification Party to the extent that a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law. In the event of a
final and non-appealable determination by a court that any payment of
expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the Indemnification Parties shall
promptly refund to the Indemnifying Parties the amount of all such expenses
theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

  



  

(vii) In no event shall the Indemnifying Parties be responsible for any
losses, claims, liabilities, expenses, judgments, fines or amounts paid in
settlement of (A) any Proceedings arising due to violations of Section 16
under the Exchange Act or (B) for which the Indemnification Party has
previously been reimbursed from other sources.

  



  

(c) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering
those trustees, directors and officers who are currently covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (the " _Company
Insured Parties_ ") (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent)
(or, in lieu of

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

maintaining such insurance, cause coverage to be provided under any policy
maintained for the benefit of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise
obtained by Parent, so long as the terms thereof are no less advantageous to
the intended beneficiaries thereof than those of the Companys policy);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend
in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance, and; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may purchase six-year "tail"
coverage covering acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time on
substantially similar terms to the existing policy of the Company.

  



  

(d) This Section 6.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company. If Parent or
Subsidiary or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case the successors and assigns of such entity
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6, which obligations
are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each director, trustee and officer covered hereby.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Publicity_. The initial press release to be issued with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be in the form agreed
to by the parties prior to the execution of this Agreement.  Except as
otherwise required by law, court process or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange or national quotation system or as contemplated or
provided elsewhere herein, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue any
press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without prior consultation
with the other and without providing the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon such press release.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefits_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, include all employees of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time who remain employees of the Surviving Company in the benefit
programs of Parent applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company acknowledges and agrees that this
obligation shall not be construed to include equity-based awards or grants as
such awards or grants are solely within the discretion of the board of
directors of Parent.  At all times following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause, or shall cause the Surviving Company to cause, each of the employee
benefit plans and programs covering individuals who were employees of the
Company before the Effective Time to recognize service (solely for
eligibility and vesting purposes performed as an employee of the Company
prior to the Effective Time) but such recognition of service will not be
required to result in any duplication of benefits.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Recommendation of the Company s Board of Trustees; Shareholder
Approval; Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

  



  

(a) If the Company Shareholders Approval is required by law to consummate the
Merger, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable law and its
Declaration of Trust and Bylaws, as promptly as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose
of obtaining such approval. The record date for determining eligibility to
vote at the Shareholders Meeting shall be after the date on which
Subsidiary shall have purchased and paid for, and been recognized by the
Company as the record owner of, the Shares duly tendered in, and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration of, the Offer. Subject to the duties of
the Companys board of trustees under applicable law, the Company shall,
through its board of trustees, advise the Merger and recommend to
its shareholders that the Company

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

Shareholders Approval be given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent
and Subsidiary in the aggregate shall acquire 90% or more of the
then outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties shall
take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause the Merger, pursuant to
the terms thereof, to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable
after such acquisition without a meeting of the shareholders of the Company
and otherwise in accordance with Section 8-501.1 of the REIT Law and the LLC
Act (including, without limitation, filing of articles of merger with the
SDAT in accordance with the REIT Law and the LLC Act and consistent with the
terms of the Merger).

  



  

(b) If the Company Shareholders Approval is required by law to consummate the
Merger, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the expiration of
the Offer, prepare and file a preliminary proxy statement (as amended
and supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") with the SEC and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC or its staff, and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all
such comments to the satisfaction of the staff. If at any time prior to the
Shareholders Meeting there shall occur any event that, in the judgment of the
Company after consultation with its legal advisors, should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement. Parent
shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto and shall furnish the Company with all
information required to be included therein with respect to Parent or
Subsidiary. The Company shall not use any proxy material (including, without
limitation, the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto) in
connection with the Shareholders Meeting without prior consultation with
Parent which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(c) Parent agrees to cause all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all
other Shares owned by Parent or Subsidiary to be voted in favor of the
Merger.

  



  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties
shall correct promptly any information provided by it to be used specifically
in the Proxy Statement, if required, that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps necessary to file
with the SEC and have declared effective or cleared by the SEC any amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause
the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company, in each case to the extent required by applicable law.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and its trustees relating to the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement until the
consummation of the Offer, and thereafter, Parent shall direct the defense of
such litigation and shall give the Company and its directors an opportunity
to participate in such litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
settlement, other than a settlement permitted to be made under Section
6.1(i), shall be agreed to prior to the consummation of the Offer without
Parents consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no settlement requiring a payment
or an admission of any wrongdoing by a trustee shall be agreed to without
such trustees consent.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Takeover Statute; Ownership Limitation_. If any Takeover
Statute, or any provision under applicable law or the Declaration of Trust
restricting the ability of Parent or Subsidiary to enjoy full voting and
economic rights of Shares to be acquired in the Offer, shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent,
Subsidiary and the Company and the members of their respective boards of
directors or trustees, as the case may be, shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise shall act to eliminate or

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

minimize the effects of any such provision, statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ _that_ such approval or such
action will not affect the status of the Company as a REIT.

  



  

Section 6.12 _FIRPTA Certification_. Within two days prior to the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall provide to the Parent and
Subsidiary a certification in accordance with Sections 1.897-2(h) and
1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Treasury regulations to the effect that Company is not,
nor has it been at any time during the specified period in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii), a "United States Real Property Holding Corporation" as that
term is defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

  



  

Section 6.13 _Officer s Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate, dated the date of the consummation of the Offer and duly
executed by an officer of the Company in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, certifying that (i) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, disregarding
all qualifications and exceptions contained therein relating to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification (except
for the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.6(i), for which
such qualifiers shall not be disregarded), shall be true and correct at the
date hereof and as of the date of the consummation of the Offer with the same
effect as if made at and as of such time (other than representations and
warranties that specifically relate to an earlier date or changes resulting
from actions permitted under Section 6.1 of this Agreement, in which cases
such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date), with only such exceptions as, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the Company has
performed and complied in all material respects with its covenants and
obligations contained in the Agreement; and (iii) there has not occurred a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

Section 6.14 _Protective TRS Election_. On the date of the purchase of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall make a protective election
jointly with Parent for the Company to be a "taxable REIT subsidiary" (a
"TRS"), as defined in Section 856(l)(1) of the Code, of Parent by executing
an Internal Revenue Service Form 8875 (or any successor form), effective as
of the date of the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, which election
shall state that it is to be effective only if the Company does not qualify
as a REIT for any period covered by such election.

_provided, however_ , if such failure to be true and correct is curable on or

Agreement shall forthwith become void except as specifically provided herein
and, except as provided in this Section 8.2 and in Sections 6.3 and 8.3(b)

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, including without limitation Section
8.3(b), each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the

means the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of any advisors, counsel and
accountants, incurred by the party or on its behalf in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and the out-of-pocket
expenses of the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement and the solicitation of Company Shareholder Approval.

  



  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) Section 8.1(b)(iii) by
Parent and such termination was the result of a breach of a representation or
warranty of the Company (x) made as of the date of this Agreement or (y) made
after the date of this Agreement and that was the result of any action or
inaction by the Company or any event, circumstance or occurrence that was
within the control of the Company, (ii) Section 8.1(b)(iv) by Parent, (iii)
Section 8.1(c) (i)(x) or (y) or 8.1(c)(ii) by Parent with regard to an action
contemplated by 8.1(c)(i)(x) or (y), (iv) Section 8.1(d) by the Company, (v)
Section 8.1(c)(i)(z) or 8.1(c)(ii) by Parent with regard to an action
contemplated by 8.1(c)(i)(z) and prior to or within 12 months following such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive written agreement with
respect to or consummates a Takeover Proposal or (vi) or Section 8.1(b)(i) by
the Company and prior to the time of such termination pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i), the Company has received a Takeover Proposal that is still
outstanding and prior to or within 12 months following such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive written agreement with respect to or
consummates such Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent a
fee (the " _Break Fee_ ") equal to the lesser of (1) of $4,500,000 (the "
_Base Amount_ ") and (2) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid
to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the REIT requirements determined
as if the payment of such amount did

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

not constitute income described in Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
("Qualifying Income"), as determined by independent accountants to Parent and
(B) in the event Parent receives a tax opinion indicating that either (x)
Parents receipt of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income
or would be excluded from Parents gross income for purposes of Section
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (y) in outside counsels opinion the receipt
by Parent of the Base Amount should not cause Parent to fail to qualify as a
REIT, the Base Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above.  In
the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Base Amount, the
Company shall place the unpaid amount ( _i.e._ , the difference between the
Base Amount and the amount determined under this Section 8.3(b)) in escrow
and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and until the
Company receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter(s)
from Parents outside counsel or independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent
to fail to meet the requirements of a REIT for any relevant taxable year,
together with an IRS ruling or opinion of tax counsel to the effect that such
payment would not be treated as included in income for any prior
taxable year, in which event such maximum amount shall be paid to Parent, or
(ii) a tax opinion indicating that Parents receipt of the Base Amount in
whole or in part would not cause Parent to fail to qualify as a REIT and that
such payment would not be treated as included in income for any prior taxable
year, in which event the Company shall pay to Parent the unpaid Base Amount.
The fee amount determined above shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified to the Company by Parent. Such fee
shall be paid within one Business Day after the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to or consummates a Takeover Proposal in
the case of clauses (v) and (vi) of the first sentence of this Section 8.3(b)
and otherwise within one Business Day of termination. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.3(b) when it is required to be paid, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the fee set forth in this Section 8.3(b), the Company shall pay
to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit, including any costs of collection, together with interest on
the amount of the fee at the rate of 8% per annum from the date such fee was
required to be paid. For the purposes of this section 8.3(b) only the term "
_Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning set forth in Section 6.2(c),
except that references to 20% in such definition shall be deemed to be
references to 50%.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
Section 8.3(e), the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with
respect to any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Break
Fee is payable (other than a termination by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) or (iv) by reason of a willful or intentional breach of this
Agreement by the Company), the payment of the Break Fee shall, in light of
the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute
liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim
which Parent and Subsidiary would otherwise be entitled to assert against the
Company or any of its assets, or against any of its trustees, officers,
employees and shareholders with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy available to Parent and Subsidiary. Except for nonpayment of the Break
Fee the parties hereby agree that, upon termination of this Agreement in
circumstances where the Break Fee is payable, in no event (other than a
termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) or (iv) by reason of a
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by the Company)shall Parent
or Subsidiary (i) seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against the Company
or any of its assets, or against any of its trustees, officers, employees or
shareholders or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any
kind, including, without limitation, consequential, indirect or punitive
damages.

  



  

(d) If the Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) or (iv), then Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the third-party, out of

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

pocket expenses incurred by the Company (plus any interest payable pursuant
to this Section 8.3(d)) (the " _Company Break-up Expenses_ "), which amount
shall not exceed $2,000,000 and (2) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that
can be paid to the Company without causing it to fail to meet the REIT
requirements determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income, as determined by independent accountants to Company and
(B) in the event Company receives an opinion from counsel indicating that it
has received a ruling from the IRS holding that Companys receipt of the
Company Break-up Expenses would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from Companys gross income for purposes of Section 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code, the Company Break-up Expenses less the amount payable under
clause (A) above. In the event that Company is not able to receive the full
Company Break-up Expenses, the Parent shall place the unpaid amount (i.e.,
the difference between the Company Break-up Expenses and the amount
determined under this Section 8.3(d)) in escrow and no portion thereof shall
be released to Company unless and until the Parent receives any one
or combination of the following: (i) a letter(s) from Companys outside
counsel or independent accountants indicating the maximum amount of the
unpaid Company Break-up expenses that can be paid at that time to Company
without causing Company to fail to meet the requirements of a REIT for any
relevant taxable year, together with an IRS ruling to the effect that such
payment would not be treated as included in income for any prior taxable
year, in which event such amount shall be released to the Company from escrow
or (ii) an opinion of counsel indicating that the Company has received a
ruling from the IRS holding that the Companys receipt of the Company Break-
up Expenses in whole or in part would not cause Company to fail to qualify as
a REIT and that such payment would not be treated as included in income for
any prior taxable year, in which event the unpaid Company Break-up Expenses
referenced in such opinion shall be released to the Company. The
Parents obligation to pay any unpaid portion of Payment shall terminate five
years from the date of this Agreement. Subject to satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in this Section 8.3(d), there is no limitation on the
number of distributions that can be made from the escrow prior to the fifth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 8.3(d), the Company Break-Up Expenses shall be paid to the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
specified to Parent by the Company and such amount shall be paid within one
Business Day of termination. Parent acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3(d) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to
pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) when it is required to be
paid, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Parent for the fees set forth in this Section
8.3(d), Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, including any costs of
collection, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate of 8%
per annum from the date such fee was required to be paid.

  



  

(e) If the Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)
or (iv) and the Break Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then the
Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the third-party, out of pocket
expenses incurred by Parent (the " _Parent Break-up Expenses_ "), which
amount shall not exceed $2,000,000. The Parent Break-Up Expenses shall be
paid to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
specified to the Company by Parent. Such fee shall be paid within one
Business Day of termination. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3(e) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay
the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3(e) when it is required to be
paid, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the fees set forth in this
Section 8.3(e), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, including any costs
of collection, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate of
8% per annum from the date such fee was required to be paid.

 **ANNEX A

  _Agreement and Plan of Merger_**

  

 ** **

  

 _Conditions to the Offer_. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer
or the Agreement, in addition to (and not in limitation of)
Subsidiarys rights pursuant to the Agreement to extend and amend the Offer
in accordance with the Agreement, and subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c)) under the Exchange Act
relating to Subsidiarys obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares
after termination of the Offer, Subsidiary shall not be required to accept
for payment or pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of, or,
subject to Rule 14e-1(c) of the Exchange Act, the payment for, any tendered
Shares not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, and Subsidiary may
amend the Offer (subject to Section 1.1 of the Agreement) if (i) a number of
Shares representing at least a majority of the sum of (x) the total number of
outstanding Shares plus (y) the total number of Shares issuable upon exercise
of outstanding options, warrants, conversion privileges and other similar
rights (excluding any Shares issuable pursuant to the Share Option Agreement)
shall not have been validly tendered prior to the expiration of the Offer and
not withdrawn or otherwise acquired by Parent or any of its affiliates prior
to the expiration of the Offer (" _Minimum Condition_ "); or (ii) at any time
on or after the date of the Agreement and prior to the time of acceptance of
such Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer or the payment therefor, any of
the following conditions has occurred and continues to exist through the time
of acceptance for payment or payment:

  



  

(a) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree,
ruling, judgment, decision, order or injunction enacted, entered,
enforced, promulgated, issued or enforced, or any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, ruling, judgment, decision, order or injunction
which has been proposed by the relevant legislative, judicial or regulatory
body with respect to or deemed applicable to, or any material consent or
approval withheld or any other action taken with respect to (i) Parent, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or (ii) the
Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, by any court or other Governmental Authority, in any case, that
has resulted or, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is reasonably likely
to result, directly or indirectly, in making illegal, prohibiting or
restraining the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement;

  



  

(b) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement, disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein
relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or
qualification (except for the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.6(i), for which such qualifiers shall not be disregarded), shall
not be true and correct at the date of the Agreement and as of the date of
the consummation of the Offer with the same effect as if made at and as of
such time (other than representations and warranties that specifically relate
to an earlier date or changes resulting from actions permitted under Section
6.1 of the Agreement, in which cases such representations and warranties
shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), with only such exceptions
as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company; (ii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in
all material respects with its covenants and obligations contained in the
Agreement, which failure to perform has not been cured within five business
days after the giving of written notice to the Company; or (iii) there shall
have occurred since the date of the Agreement any events or changes which,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company;

  



  

(c) the board of trustees of the Company or any committee thereof shall have
(i) withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent or Subsidiary its
approval or recommendation of the Offer or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) approved or recommended any
Takeover Proposal, (iii) failed to reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer
or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement within
five business days after the public announcement of a Takeover Proposal
(including the filing of a Schedule 13D with the SEC) or (iv) resolved to
take any of the foregoing actions;

  



  



  

ANNEX A-1   

     
   

  



  

(d) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

  



  

(e) there shall have occurred and be continuing (i) any general suspension of
trading in, or limitation in prices for securities on Nasdaq or any other
national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market upon which the
Shares are traded or quoted (other than as a result of market circuit-
breakers or other similar procedures) or (ii) the declaration of a banking
moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United
States (whether or not mandatory); or

  



  

(f) all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, authorizations, notices,
reports or other filings required to be obtained or made by the Company,
Parent or Subsidiary with or from any Governmental Authority or third party
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement,
the Offer and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been made or obtained and such failure could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

In addition, it shall be a condition to Subsidiarys obligations to accept
for payment or pay for any tendered shares that Parent and Subsidiary shall
have received an opinion of Hogan and Hartson, LLP, dated as of the date of the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, in a form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent, to the effect that commencing with its taxable
year ended on December 31, 2003 through the time immediately preceding the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Company has been organized and operated in
conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Code. For purposes of such opinion, Hogan and Hartson LLP may rely on
assumptions that (i) the Company will satisfy Section 856(a)(5) of the Code
for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2005, and (ii) the Company (or
Parent as successor to the Company) will make any potential distribution
contemplated in Section 4.11(4) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

Subject to the provisions of Section 1.1 of the Agreement, the foregoing
conditions are solely for the benefit of Parent and Subsidiary and may be
waived by either Parent or Subsidiary, in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Subsidiary.
The failure by Parent and Subsidiary at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.
