 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree as follows:    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I    

THE CASH TENDER OFFER    

 1.1 _The Offer_.   

 (a) _Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of public announcement of the execution of this Agreement (but in any event not later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of such public announcement), Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")), the Offer to purchase any and all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price of $15.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (such amount, or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer Consideration_ "). On the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall accept for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as legally permitted to do so under applicable Law after the expiration of the Offer, and shall pay for all such shares promptly after acceptance and in any event in compliance with the obligations respecting prompt payment pursuant to Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Law_ " means any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule, administrative interpretation, executive order, regulation or other requirement of any Governmental Entity. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered and not withdrawn immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer such number of shares of Company Common Stock that would constitute at least a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock that in the aggregate are outstanding determined on a Fully Diluted Basis on the date of the expiration of the Offer (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and to the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ to this Agreement. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Basis_ " means, as of any applicable date, without duplication, the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding together with the shares of Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to obligations outstanding under the Company Stock Plans, the ESPP or similar benefit plans, the conversion or exchange of all outstanding securities convertible or exchangeable into, shares of Company Common Stock, or otherwise, in each case whether or not vested, exerciseable, exercised or converted at the time of determination.    

 (b) _Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendments; Subsequent Offering Period_. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). As used in this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Purchaser expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with the Exchange Act, to waive, amend or modify any term or condition of the Offer in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (and Parent shall not cause or permit Purchaser to): (i) waive      ##### 

  

     

the Minimum Condition; (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, decrease the Offer Consideration or decrease the number of shares of
Company Common Stock sought pursuant to the Offer; (iii) amend any material
term of the Offer in any manner adverse to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock; (iv) impose any condition to the Offer not set forth in _Annex
I_ ; or (v) extend the expiration date of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, without the consent of the Company, Purchaser may extend the expiration
date of the Offer (A) as required by applicable Law (including for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof),
(B) if, immediately prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as
it may be extended) and prior to acceptance for payment by Purchaser of any
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, any condition to the
Offer has not been satisfied or waived, Purchaser may, in its
sole discretion, extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more
periods (not in excess of five (5) Business Days each), (C) if, immediately
prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended),
the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitute at least the Minimum
Condition but less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for one or
more periods not to exceed an aggregate of ten (10) Business Days,
notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of such
expiration date of the Offer, (D) in connection with an increase in the
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer so as to comply with
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, or (E) in PurchaserÂ’s sole
discretion, for any other reason for one or more periods not to exceed an
aggregate of five (5) Business Days. Purchaser may, without the consent of
the Company, elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act following its acceptance
for payment of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer. If, as of the
initial expiration date of the Offer or any expiration date of the Offer
within fifteen (15) Business Days of the initial expiration date of the
Offer, the HSR Condition, the Exon-Florio Condition or the DSS Condition,
in each case, as set forth in _Annex I_ , have not been satisfied or waived
but are reasonably capable of being satisfied within fifteen (15) Business
Days of the initial expiration date of the Offer, and if all other conditions
set forth in _Annex I_ are satisfied or are reasonably capable of being
satisfied on such expiration date, then, upon the written request of the
Company, provided the Company is in full compliance with its obligations
hereunder and the Principal Stockholders are in full compliance with their
obligations pursuant to the Stockholder Agreements, Parent agrees to cause
Purchaser to extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more
periods not to exceed an aggregate of fifteen (15) Business Days from the
initial expiration date of the Offer.    

 (c) _Schedule TO and Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer.

Parent and Purchaser agree that the Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and, on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be      #####

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that

respect; and Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule TO and, as applicable, the Offer Documents and to

as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable and adequate opportunity to

 3.1 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.   

 (a) _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holder of any of the following securities:      

 (i) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to clause (ii) below and any Appraisal Shares (as defined in _Section 3.1(b))_ shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished and be converted into and become the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation $15.50 in cash per share (or any such higher price per share of Company Common Stock as may be paid in the Offer) without any interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and all other rights of the holder thereof with respect thereto shall cease to exist;

holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time

any of the foregoing.

From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Paying Agent, on a timely basis as and when needed, cash necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ upon surrender of Certificates (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").    

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event, not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a Letter of Transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and properly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ into the right to receive, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate     ##### 

  

     

or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.    

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. Upon the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided for in this _Article III_.    

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, but shall have no greater rights against Parent than may be accorded to general unsecured creditors of Parent under applicable Law.    

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, its Affiliates, Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or their respective Representatives (as defined in  _Section 6.2_) shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.    

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.    

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay to such holder the Merger Consideration required pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof with such assurances as Parent, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration, may require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, and upon posting by such holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim in respect thereof.     ##### 

  

     

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. If and to the extent that amounts so withheld are not paid to a taxing authority, such amount shall be tendered to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made by Purchaser.    

3.3 _Company Stock Options; ESPP_

The Company shall use its best efforts to obtain all consents of the holders of the Company Stock Options as shall be necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, payment shall, at ParentÂ’s      #####

 (d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board shall adopt such resolutions or take such actions as are required under applicable Law and the CompanyÂ’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") to: (i) immediately suspend any right to increase contributions into the ESPP and freeze contribution rates currently in effect; (ii) suspend all further contributions to the ESPP as of April 23, 2005 (the " _Suspension Date_ "); (iii) designate and treat the second (2nd) Business Day following the Suspension Date as the last day of the Option Period (as such term is defined in the ESPP) now in progress under the ESPP; (iv) in accordance with the ESPP, provide that the Option Price (as such term is defined in the ESPP) for the current Option Period for employees whose contributions to the ESPP (A) commenced as of January 1, 2005 shall be $11.98 (the " _January ESPP Price_ ")) and (B) commenced as of April 1, 2005 shall be $10.82 (the " _April ESPP Price_ " and, together with the January ESPP Price, the " _ESPP Price_ ") which, in each case, is equal to 85% of the average of the high and low sales prices of the Company Common Stock of the applicable first day of the current Option Period; (v) suspend commencement of any new Option Periods under the ESPP; (vi) assure that all amounts contributed by each participant under the ESPP and not theretofore withdrawn are converted pursuant to the ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the per share Merger Consideration, multiplied by (B) such participantÂ’s ESPP Number (as defined below); and (vii) terminate the ESPP at the Effective Time. With respect to each ESPP participant, the " _ESPP Number_ " shall mean the quotient (rounded to the nearest tenth) of (x) the amount of their total contributions to the ESPP as of the Suspension Date less any amount withdrawn therefrom prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the applicable ESPP Price.

hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to

on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other
hand or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)). The CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ systems of
internal controls over financial reporting are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii)
that receipts and expenditures are executed only in accordance with the
authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or
timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
CompanyÂ’s and the SubsidiariesÂ’ assets that would materially affect the
CompanyÂ’s financial statements. No material weakness was identified in
managementÂ’s assessment of internal controls as of December 31, 2004 (nor has
any such material weakness since been identified). The CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that (x) all information (both financial and non-financial) required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (y) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the CompanyÂ’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports. The audit committee of the Company Board includes an Audit
Committee Financial Expert, as defined by Item 401(h)(2) of Regulation
S-K. The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of
Regulation S-K, applicable to its principal executive officer, principal
financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons
performing similar functions. There has not been any change in or waiver of
the CompanyÂ’s code of ethics, and to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, there have been
no violations of the CompanyÂ’s code of ethics by its principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, persons performing similar functions, or other senior executive
officers.

Without expanding its obligations hereunder, the obligation of Parent and Purchaser to use "reasonable best efforts" to obtain waivers, consents and approvals to loan agreements, leases and other Contracts specifically shall not include any obligation to agree to, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof shall agree (without the prior consent of Parent) to, a modification of the terms of such documents, or to make any guaranty or monetary payment in consideration of such waiver, consent or approval. Without prejudice or limitation to the representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, each party acknowledges and agrees that the issuance of security clearances is in the discretion of the appropriate Governmental Entities, and no party shall bear responsibility for the results of the exercise of such discretion.    

 (b) _Notifications by Company_. The Company shall confer with Parent on a regular and frequent basis as reasonably requested by Parent concerning operational matters and promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any significant change or event, including any having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, could have, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent (or its counsel) copies of all filings made by the     ##### 

  

     

Company with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and

Offers. Prior to the consummation of the Offers, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and
supervision over its business operations.   

 (c) _State Takeover Law_.

 7.2 _Option to Acquire Additional Shares._    

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Purchaser Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of newly issued and treasury shares of the Company Common Stock (the " _Purchaser Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (after giving effect to the issuance of Purchaser Option Shares) for a consideration per Purchaser Option Share equal to the Offer Consideration.    

 (b) The Purchaser Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and payment for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer by Parent or Purchaser as a result of which Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates own beneficially at least 80% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock. Such Purchaser Option shall not be exercisable to the extent the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto exceeds the number of authorized shares of Company Common Stock available for issuance.    

 (c) In the event Parent and Purchaser wish to exercise the Purchaser Option, Purchaser shall give the Company one (1) Business Day prior written notice specifying the number of shares of the Company Common Stock that are or will be owned by Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates immediately following consummation of the Offer and specifying a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying the number of Purchaser Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Purchaser Option Shares, the portion of the purchase price owing upon exercise of such Purchaser Option which equals the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to such Purchaser Option, multiplied by (y) the Offer Consideration, shall be paid to the Company in cash by wire transfer or cashierÂ’s check.     #####

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the parties shall, at the request of Parent, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. If the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger, to the extent permitted by the DGCL, and in accordance with all relevant provisions thereof, at ParentÂ’s request, the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action to obtain the requisite approval and adoption by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders of this Agreement and the Merger by written consent without a meeting.

The Company shall consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders and file with the SEC any such amendment or supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders unless it has first obtained the consent of Parent to such mailing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.     ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Voting of Shares by Parent and Purchaser_.

No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section or otherwise shall affect or be     #####

the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Offer or
the Merger.   

 (b) Neither any investigation conducted by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this  _Section 7.5_ nor the results thereof shall affect any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or the ability of Parent to rely thereon. The parties acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a non-disclosure agreement, dated as of February 9, 2005 (the " _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ "), which Non-Disclosure Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein.

Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any communications to Company employees with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger.   

 7.7 _Indemnification_.   

 (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless (including advancement of expenses) the current and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Covered Parties_ ") in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in their respective Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or similar governing instruments as in effect as of the date of this Agreement which shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a "run-off" directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and indemnification policy (the " _Run-off D andO Insurance_") for the Covered Parties providing coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for a period not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time for all persons that are directors and officers of the Company or its  Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and indemnification policy with a six year aggregate policy limit of $10 million; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 200% of the current annual premium (the " _Current Premium_ ") of the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and indemnification policy as in effect on the date hereof for Run-off DandO Insurance, and if the cost of such Run-off DandO     ##### 

  

     

Insurance would exceed 200% of the Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage for six (6) years as is
available for 200% of the Current Premium. If the Run-off DandO Insurance
cannot be maintained, expires or is terminated or cancelled during such six-
year period, the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable efforts to replace
such coverage for the remainder of such period on terms and conditions
substantially similar to the existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and
indemnification policy; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of an aggregate of 100%
of the Current Premium to replace the Run-off DandO Insurance, and if
the expense of replacing such Run-off DandO Insurance would exceed 100% of the
Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount

This _Section 7.7_ shall survive the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the current and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by any of them.

This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

 10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Parent and/or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company, provided that Parent and/or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement.

In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to any particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
