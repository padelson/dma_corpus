<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;<U><B>Agreement</B></U>&#148;), dated as of April&nbsp;25, 2005, is
by and among NORTEL NETWORKS INC., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U><B>Parent</B></U>&#148;), PS MERGER SUB,
INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the &#147;<U><B>Purchaser</B></U>&#148;), and
PEC SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U><B>Company</B></U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have
determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders
for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Purchaser will make a cash tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the &#147;<U><B>Offer</B></U>&#148;) to
purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the
&#147;<U><B>Company Common Stock</B></U>&#148;), of the Company, at a price of $15.50 per share of Company Common
Stock, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, to effectuate such acquisition, following consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will
be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in
such merger (the &#147;<U><B>Merger</B></U>&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in connection with such acquisition, Parent and Purchaser have entered into certain
agreements, dated as of the date hereof (collectively, the &#147;<U><B>Stockholder Agreements</B></U>&#148;) with
certain of the stockholders of the Company identified therein (collectively, the &#147;<U><B>Principal
Stockholders</B></U>&#148;) in respect of (x)&nbsp;shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such
Principal Stockholders; and (y)&nbsp;the treatment of certain proceeds of the Offer and/or the Merger
payable to such Principal Stockholders; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i)&nbsp;determined that the Offer and the
Merger are fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders; (ii)&nbsp;declared
the advisability of and approved this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the &#147;<U><B>DGCL</B></U>&#148;); and (iii)&nbsp;resolved to recommend that
the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock accept the Offer and adopt this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree as

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>THE CASH TENDER OFFER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <U>The Offer</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares</U>. Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with <U><B>Section&nbsp;9.1</B></U>, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of public
announcement of the execution of this Agreement (but in any event not later than twenty (20)
Business Days after the date of such public announcement), Purchaser shall commence (within the
meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations thereunder, the &#147;<U><B>Exchange Act</B></U>&#148;)), the Offer to purchase any and all
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price of $15.50 per share, net to the seller in
cash, without interest thereon (such amount, or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the
Offer, the &#147;<U><B>Offer Consideration</B></U>&#148;). On the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall accept for payment all
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
legally permitted to do so under applicable Law after the expiration of the Offer, and shall pay
for all such shares promptly after acceptance and in any event in compliance with the obligations
respecting prompt payment pursuant to Rule&nbsp;14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this
Agreement, &#147;<U><B>Law</B></U>&#148; means any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule,
administrative interpretation, executive order, regulation or other requirement of any Governmental
Entity. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn shall be subject to the condition that there
shall be validly tendered and not withdrawn immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer such
number of shares of Company Common Stock that would constitute at least a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock that in the aggregate are outstanding determined on a Fully Diluted Basis on
the date of the expiration of the Offer (the &#147;<U><B>Minimum Condition</B></U>&#148;) and to the other
conditions set forth in <U><B>Annex I</B></U> to this Agreement. The Company agrees that no shares of
Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.
For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<U><B>Fully Diluted Basis</B></U>&#148; means, as of any applicable date,
without duplication, the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding together with the
shares of Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to obligations
outstanding under the Company Stock Plans, the ESPP or similar benefit plans, the conversion or
exchange of all outstanding securities convertible or exchangeable into, shares of Company Common
Stock, or otherwise, in each case whether or not vested, exerciseable, exercised or converted at
the time of determination.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendments; Subsequent Offering Period</U>. The
initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP>) Business Day after

Exchange Act). As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;<U><B>Business Day</B></U>&#148; shall have the meaning
set forth in Rule&nbsp;14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Purchaser expressly reserves the
right, subject to compliance with the Exchange Act, to waive, amend or modify any term or condition
of the Offer in its sole discretion; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, without the prior
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (and Parent shall not cause or permit Purchaser to):

Company Common Stock; (iv)&nbsp;impose any condition to the Offer not set forth in <U><B>Annex I</B></U>; or

discretion, extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods (not in excess of five
(5)&nbsp;Business Days each), (C)&nbsp;if, immediately prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer
(as it may be extended), the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly

other reason for one or more periods not to exceed an aggregate of five (5)&nbsp;Business Days.
Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, elect to provide a subsequent offering period
for the Offer in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 of the Exchange Act following its acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer. If, as of the initial expiration date of
the Offer or any expiration date of the Offer within fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Days of the initial
expiration date of the Offer, the HSR Condition, the Exon-Florio Condition or the DSS Condition, in
each case, as set forth in <U><B>Annex I</B></U>, have not been satisfied or waived but are reasonably
capable of being satisfied within fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Days of the initial expiration date of the
Offer, and if all other conditions set forth in <U><B>Annex I</B></U> are satisfied or are reasonably
capable of being satisfied on such expiration date, then, upon the written request of the Company,
provided the Company is in full compliance with its obligations hereunder and the Principal
Stockholders are in full compliance with their obligations pursuant to the Stockholder Agreements,
Parent agrees to cause Purchaser to extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods
not to exceed an aggregate of fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Days from the initial expiration date of the
Offer.

delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has not
theretofore complied with this <U><B>Article&nbsp;III</B></U> shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of the Merger Consideration, but shall have no greater rights against Parent than may be accorded

3.1(a)(i)</B></U> in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof with such assurances as Parent, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration, may require of the holder of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, and upon posting by such holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim in respect thereof.

be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent. If and to the extent that amounts so withheld are not paid to a taxing
authority, such amount shall be tendered to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made by Purchaser.

provide as follows: (i)&nbsp;except as expressly provided hereby, the outstanding Company Stock Options
shall not be altered or modified as a consequence of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and the applicable vesting periods shall not be shortened,
waived or otherwise accelerated in any way (it being understood and agreed that this provision
shall not prohibit any automatic, non-discretionary acceleration of vesting pursuant to the terms
of the Company&#146;s Key Executive Severance Plan and agreements issued in connection therewith that
are signed and in effect on the date of this Agreement and are listed in attachment 2 of
<U><B>Section&nbsp;4.14(h)</B></U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule); (ii)&nbsp;at the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and converted into the right, subject to

case of an outstanding Company Stock Option that is vested at the Effective Time, the holder of
such vested Company Stock Option shall at the Effective Time receive a payment of an amount equal
to (i)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of (x)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over
(y)&nbsp;the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option
is then exercisable and not theretofore exercised; and (B)&nbsp;in the case of an outstanding Company
Stock Option that is unvested at the Effective Time, if and only to the extent the holder satisfies
the vesting requirements in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option
existing as of the date hereof, the holder of such unvested Company Stock Option shall become
entitled to a payment calculated as set forth in <U><B>Section&nbsp;3.3(a)(ii)(A)</B></U>, above, on such

Option; and (iii)&nbsp;notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Stock Option with an exercise price
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be automatically cancelled and cease to
exist at the Effective Time without further action on the part of the Company or the holder of such
Company Stock Option. The Company shall use its best efforts to obtain all consents of the holders
of the Company Stock Options as shall be necessary to effectuate the foregoing.

required to satisfy Section&nbsp;401(k)(3) or Section&nbsp;401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for
compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section&nbsp;401(k)(3) and Section&nbsp;401(m)(2) of the

may be, for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date.

covered by <U><B>Section&nbsp;4.14(k)</B></U> of this Agreement, none of the Company, or, any Company
Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained a Company Employee Plan which was ever
subject to Section&nbsp;412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. No Company Employee Plan is funded by a

No Company Employee Plan holds securities issued by the Company, any of the Company&#146;s Subsidiaries
or any of their ERISA Affiliates.

Subsidiaries which are a party thereto may terminate their participation therein in accordance with
the applicable Company Employee Plan documents at any time without liability to the Company or is
Subsidiary, and subject to applicable Law. No Company Employee Plan, plan document or agreement,
summary plan description or other written communication distributed generally to Company Persons by
its terms prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company
Employee Plan sponsored or maintained principally by such Company or Subsidiary, as applicable, in
accordance with the
Company Employee Plan document. The investment vehicles used to fund the Company Employee
Plans may be changed at any time without incurring a material sales charge, surrender fee or other
similar expense that would be payable in whole or in part by the Company.

parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that Parent and/or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company, provided that Parent and/or Purchaser, as
the case may be, shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to

event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties
