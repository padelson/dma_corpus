iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of January 13, 2020 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among: Cott
Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of Canada (" _Parent_ ");
Cott Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Holdings_ "); Fore Merger LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (" _Merger Sub 2_ "); Fore
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Merger Sub 2 (" _Purchaser_ "); and Primo Water Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ") (each of the Company, Purchaser, Merger Sub 2,
Holdings and Parent a " _Party_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit A. 

RECITALS

 

A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Parent has
agreed to cause Purchaser to commence an exchange offer (as it may be amended
from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Shares_
") for the consideration and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein.

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "
_First_ _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
in the First Merger (the " _First Surviving Corporation_ "), whereby, except
as expressly provided in Section 2.6, (i) each issued and outstanding Share
not owned by Parent, Purchaser, or any Acquired Corporation as of the First
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the Company shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Merger Sub 2 as a result of the First Merger.

 

C. Immediately following the First Merger, the First Surviving Corporation
shall merge with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving
entity (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together with the First Merger, the "
_Mergers_ ").

 

D. The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and
the Transactions are advisable and fair to, and in the best interest of, the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) agreed that the First Merger shall be
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, (iii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares accept
the Offer and tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the
recommendation of the Company Board, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

E. The Parent Board has determined that, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement and the Transactions
are advisable and in the best interest of Parent and its stockholders, and has
approved the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions.

  



1 F. The Board of Directors of Purchaser has determined that, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement and the
Transactions are advisable and in the best interest of Purchaser and its
stockholder, and has approved the execution, delivery and performance by
Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions.

G. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the First
Merger shall be governed by, and effected pursuant to, Section 251(h) of the
DGCL and shall be consummated as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

H. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees that, for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the acquisition of the
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Mergers together constitue a single
integrated transaction that will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), and this Agreement constitutes and is
adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code (including within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a)).

 

I. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and Purchaser entering into
this Agreement, certain holders of the Shares (the " _Principal Stockholders_
") have entered into tender and support agreements, dated as of the Agreement
Date, in substantially the form set forth in Annex II, pursuant to which,
among other things, each of the Principal Stockholders has agreed to tender
his, her or its Shares to Purchaser in the Offer (the " _Tender Agreements_
").

 

AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as practicable
after the Agreement Date, but in no event more than 10 Business Days after the
Agreement Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to commence the
Offer if the Company is not prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC
substantially contemporaneously with Purchasers filing of the Offering
Documents with the SEC.

 

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as
defined in Annex I) and the satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser of the other
conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "), as
soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms.
In the Offer, each Share accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Offer shall be exchanged for the right
to receive, at the election of the holder:

 



2  (i) $14.00 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) 1.0229 shares of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), or (iii) $5.04 in cash
and 0.6549 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Mixed Consideration_ ") (each
of the Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration and Mixed Consideration, as
applicable, the " _Offer Consideration_ "), in each case subject to proration
as set forth in Section 1.1(d) and the other provisions of this Section 1\.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains terms not inconsistent with those set forth in this
Agreement. Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to (i) increase
the Offer Consideration, (ii) waive any Offer Condition other than the
Minimum Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions
of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided,
however,_  that without the prior written consent of the Company (which the
Company may withhold in its sole discretion), Purchaser shall not (A) decrease
the Offer Consideration, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in
the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions, (E) change the Minimum Condition, (F) amend, modify, or supplement
any of the Offer Conditions in a manner adverse to the holders of the Shares,
(G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date of the Offer (except to the
extent permitted or required pursuant to Section 1.1(e)), (H) provide any
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act or (I) take any action (or fail to take any action) that would
result in the First Merger not qualifying for consummation pursuant to
Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The Offer may not be terminated prior to the
Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer without the
prior written consent of the Company, unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 8\.

(d) Elections; Proration; Fractional Shares.

 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 1.1(d), each holder of
Shares validly tendered in the Offer shall be entitled to elect (1) the
number of Shares which such holder desires to exchange for the right to
receive the Mixed Consideration (a " _Mixed Election_ ," and such shares, the
" _Mixed Election Shares_ "), (2) the number of Shares which such holder
desires to exchange for the right to receive the Cash Consideration (a " _Cash
Election_ ," and such shares, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "), and (3)
the number of Shares which such holder desires to exchange for the right to
receive the Stock Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ," and such shares, the
" _Stock Election Shares_ "). Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed
Election shall be referred to herein as an " _Election_ ," and shall be made
on a form for that purpose prepared by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to
the Company (a " _Form of Election in Offer_ "), included as part of the
letter(s) of election and transmittal accompanying the Offer. Holders of
record of Shares who hold such Shares as nominees, trustees or in other
representative capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election in Offer on
behalf of their respective beneficial holders.

(ii) Any Election pursuant to the Offer shall have been properly made only if
the depositary for the Offer shall have actually received a properly completed
Form of Election in Offer by the expiration date of the Offer. Any Form of
Election in Offer may be revoked or changed by the authorized Person properly
submitting such Form of Election in Offer by written notice received by the
depositary for the Offer prior to the expiration date of the Offer. In the
event an Election is revoked prior to the expiration date of the Offer, the
Shares represented by such Form of Election in Offer shall become Mixed
Election Shares (to the extent such Shares

 



3  remain tendered in the Offer and are not validly withdrawn from the Offer),
except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made with respect to
any or all of such Shares prior to the expiration date of the Offer. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement and of the Form of Election in Offer, the
depositary for the Offer shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether
any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in any Form of Election in Offer, and any good-
faith decisions of the depositary for the Offer regarding such matters shall
be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
the depositary for the Offer shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in a Form of Election in Offer.

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
Cash Elections and the Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as
described in this Section 1.1(d).

 

(1) The maximum number of Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in
the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Cash Consideration shall
equal 35.98% of the aggregate number of Shares tendered in the Offer (and not
validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election Shares and No Election Shares)
(the " _Maximum Cash Shares in Offer_ ").

 

(2) If the total number of Cash Election Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, such
Cash Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: for each such Cash
Election, the number of Shares that shall be exchanged for the right to
receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Cash
Election Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer
multiplied by (B) the Offer Cash Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest
Share. The " _Offer Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x)
the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer that are not exchanged for
the right to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with this Section
1.1(d)(iii)(2) shall instead be exchanged for the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

 

(3) The maximum number of Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in
the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Stock Consideration shall
equal 64.02% of the aggregate number of Shares tendered in the Offer (and not
validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election Shares and No Election Shares)
(the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Offer_ ").

 

(4) If the total number of Stock Election Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer,
such Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: for each such
Stock Election, the number of Shares that shall be exchanged for the right to
receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A) the total number of
Stock Election Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer
multiplied by (B) the Offer Stock Proration Factor, rounded down to the
nearest Share. The " _Offer Stock Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x)
the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the total number of Stock Election Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Stock Election Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer that are not
exchanged for the right to receive the Stock Consideration in accordance with
this Section 1.1(d)(iii)(4) shall instead be exchanged for the right to
receive the Cash Consideration. 

 



4 (iv) All prorations resulting from either Section 1.1(d)(iii)(2) or Section
1.1(d)(iii)(4) shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each holder of
Shares who validly tenders Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as
applicable, bears its proportionate share of the proration, based on a
percentage of the total Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as
applicable, validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such
holder of Shares bears to all Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares,
as applicable, validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by
all holders of Shares.

(v) Each Share validly tendered into the Offer (and not validly withdrawn)
but which is not the subject of a valid Election (a " _No Election Share_ ")
received prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be deemed to be a Mixed
Election Share. In no event shall any Mixed Election Shares or No Election
Shares be subject to proration pursuant to Section 1.1(d)(iii)(2) or Section
1.1(d)(iii)(4).

(vi) No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Offer, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) pursuant to the Offer shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of
Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Trading Price, rounded to
the nearest cent.

(e) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. Unless extended pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on the 21st Business Day (for
this purpose determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a)
under the Exchange Act) following the commencement date of the Offer (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ _,_ " and such date or such subsequent date to which the
expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective
termination rights under Section 8: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, if
permitted hereunder and under applicable Laws, Purchaser may, in its
discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person),
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to
10 Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A)
the minimum period required by any Law, interpretation or position of the SEC
or its staff or an applicable stock exchange or its staff, in each case,
applicable to the Offer, and (B) periods of up to 20 Business Days per
extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to
the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act or any applicable foreign
Antitrust Laws shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the

 



5  scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer
on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to 10 Business Days
per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied, it being agreed
that Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser
to, extend the Offer pursuant to this clause (iii) on more than two occasions
only if all Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Condition are satisfied on
the date on which the Offer is scheduled to expire, but the Minimum Condition
is not satisfied; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Purchaser: (1)
be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (the "
_Extension Deadline_ ") (x) the valid termination of this Agreement in
compliance with Section 8 and (y) the End Date; or (2) be permitted to extend
the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of
the Company.

(f) Payment for Shares. On the terms of and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the
meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with Section
1.1(e)) (or, at Parents election, concurrently with the expiration of the
Offer if all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or waived). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to
be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds and shares of Parent
Common Stock necessary to pay for any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however_ , that without the
prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment,
or pay for, any Shares if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less than the
number of Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The consideration
in the Offer payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder
thereof in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable, without
interest and subject to reduction for any applicable Taxes required to be
deducted or withheld in respect thereof. The Company shall register (and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to register) the
transfer of Shares accepted for payment immediately after the Acceptance Time
(such registration to be effective as of the Acceptance Time). Parent shall
cause each of Purchaser and the Surviving Company to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Purchasers and the Surviving Companys obligations under this
Agreement, and Parent shall be jointly and severally liable with Purchaser
and the Surviving Company for the due and timely performance and satisfaction
of each of such covenants, obligations and liabilities.

 

(g) Offer Consideration Adjustment. The Mixed Consideration, the Cash
Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, the
Offer Cash Proration Factor, the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer and the Offer
Stock Proration Factor shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock or shares of Parent Common Stock occurring or
having a record date on or after the Agreement Date and at or prior to the
Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Consideration shall provide
to the Company Stockholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 1.1(g)
shall be construed to permit the Company to take any such action with respect
to its securities that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



6 (h) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within two Business Days of
such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and
shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(i) Schedule TO; Offer Documents; Form S-4.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the commencement of the Offer (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall
(i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer
to Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule
TO and all amendments, supplements or exhibits thereto (which together
constitute the " _Offer Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Purchaser
with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Laws. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent further agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be promptly filed with the SEC and to be promptly
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Parent and Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff

Documents or the Offer.

(ii) Concurrently with the filing of the Offer Documents with the SEC, Parent
shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register under
the Securities Act the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the First Merger (the " _Form S-4_"). The Form S-4 will include a
preliminary prospectus containing the information required under
Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



7 (iii) The Offer Documents and the Form S-4 may include a description of the
determinations, approvals and recommendations of the Company Board described
in this Agreement (and a change to such determinations, approvals and
recommendations to the extent applicable at the relevant time). Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4 complies as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act or
Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4, if the Form S-4 is declared
effective by the SEC, effective for so long as necessary to complete the
Mergers. The Company shall furnish in writing to Parent and Purchaser all
information concerning the Acquired Corporations (including financial
information) that is reasonably requested by Parent or is required by
applicable Law or the rules of the SEC and its staff, including the comment
process, to be included in the Offer Documents and the Form S-4 so as to
enable Parent and Purchaser to comply with their obligations under this
Section 1.1(i), including providing such reasonable cooperation and
information as may be necessary or appropriate to include any pro forma
financial statements (to the extent required) in the Offer Documents and the
Form S-4 in accordance with the rules of the SEC and its staff. Parent,
Purchaser and the Company shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to
determine the information regarding the Company that is necessary to include
in the Offer Documents and the Form S-4 in order to satisfy applicable Laws
and the rules of the SEC. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its respective
Representatives for use in the Offer Documents and the Form S-4 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents and the Form S-4, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Laws, or by the SEC or its staff or by
Nasdaq, the NYSE or the TSX or their respective staff. Unless the Company
Board has made a Company Adverse Change Recommendation to the extent
permitted by Section 6.1, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents and the Form S-4 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company and its counsel (it being understood that the
Company and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable). Unless the Company Board has made a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation to the extent permitted by Section 6.1, Parent and
Purchaser shall provide in writing to the Company and its counsel any and all
written comments or other material communications that Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents and the Form S-4 promptly after such receipt, and Parent and
Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the
SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any such response, to which Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and
good-faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel
(it being understood that the Company and its counsel shall provide any
comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable)) and to participate in any
discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments. Purchaser
and Parent shall as promptly as practicable respond to any comments of the
SEC or its staff regarding the Offer Documents or the Form S-4. Parent shall
notify the Company promptly of the time when the Form S-4 or any amendment or
supplement thereto has become effective and of the issuance of any stop order
or suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Offer and the Mergers for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction. Parent shall also take any other action required to

 



8  be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign
or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the
Offer or the Mergers, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions. 

1.2 Company Actions.

of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions), and such
other assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request in connection
with the Offer or the Mergers. The information contained in any such labels,
listings and files shall be subject in all respects to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

of the DGCL. The Second Merger shall have the effects provided in this
Agreement and as specified in the DGCL and the DLLCA.

Mergers together constitute a single integrated transaction that will qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and
(b) this Agreement, including any amendment thereto, be and is hereby adopted

Company Equity Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time pursuant to
Section 2.11(a), Section 2.11(c), Section 2.11(e) or to the holder of a

of this Section 2, and each holder of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to

12 2.7 Elections; Proration.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.7, each holder of Shares
(including Shares paid to the holder of a vested Company Equity Award
immediately prior to the First Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.11(a),
Section 2.11(c), Section 2.11(e) or to the holder of a Company Warrant
pursuant to Section 2.11(k)), as applicable, as of immediately prior to the
consummation of the First Merger entitled to Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.6(a)(iv) shall be entitled to elect (1) a number of Cash Election
Shares, (2) a number of Stock Election Shares, and (3) a number of Mixed
Election Shares. Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election shall be
made on a form for that purpose prepared by Parent that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company (a " _Form of Election in Merger_ "), which shall
be mailed to such holders of Shares promptly after the Closing Date (such
date, the " _Mailing Date_ "). The deadline for submitting an effective,
properly completed Form of Election in Merger to the Exchange Agent shall be
5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 20th day following the Mailing Date (or such
other time and date as the Parties may mutually agree) (the " _Election
Deadline_ "). The Election Deadline shall not be waived unless such Election
Deadline is waived with respect to all Company Stockholders, the new election
deadline is publicly disclosed to all holders on a date mutually agreed to by
Parent and the Company, and Parent has otherwise given its prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such
waiver. Holders of record of Shares who hold such Shares as nominees, trustees
or in other representative capacities may submit multiple Forms of Election in
Merger on behalf of their respective beneficial holders.

(b) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Form of Election in Merger
by the Election Deadline. Any Form of Election in Merger may be revoked or
changed by the authorized Person properly submitting such Form of Election in
Merger, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. In the event a Form of Election in Merger is revoked prior
to the Election Deadline, the Shares represented by such Form of Election in
Merger shall become Mixed Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent
election is properly made with respect to any or all of such Shares prior to
the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Form
of Election in Merger, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Form of Election in
Merger, and any good-faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in a Form of Election in Merger.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Cash
Election Shares and Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv) shall be subject to proration as
described in this Section 2.7(c).

 

(i) The maximum number of Shares which shall be eligible to receive the Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv) shall equal 35.98% of the
aggregate number of Shares entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to 2.6(a)(iv) (excluding Mixed Election Shares and No Election Shares) (the "
_Maximum Cash Shares in Merger_ ").

 

(ii) If the total number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv) exceeds the Maximum Cash Shares
in Merger, such Cash Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: for
each such Cash Election, the number of Shares that shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Cash
Election Shares eligible to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.6(a)(iv) multiplied by (B) the Merger Cash Proration Factor, rounded down to
the

 



13  nearest Share. The " _Merger Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x)
the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Cash Shares in Merger and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares
eligible to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv). The
Cash Election Shares that were not converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.7(c)(ii) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

(iii) The maximum number of Shares which shall be eligible to receive the
Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv) shall equal 64.02% of the
aggregate number of Shares entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.6(a)(iv) (excluding Mixed Election Shares and No Election
Shares) (the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Merger_ ").

(iv) If the total number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv) exceeds the Maximum Stock Shares
in Merger, such Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: For
each such Stock Election, the number of Shares that shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A) the total number of
Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.6(a)(iv) multiplied by (B) the Merger Stock Proration Factor,
rounded down to the nearest Company Share. The " _Merger Stock Proration
Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Maximum
Stock Shares in Merger and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv). The Stock Election Shares that
were not converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.7(c)(iv) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration.

 

(d) All prorations resulting from either Section 2.7(c)(ii) or Section
2.7(c)(iv) shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each holder of
Shares eligible to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv)
bears its proportionate share of the proration, based on a percentage of the
total Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as applicable, elected
by such holder of Shares bears to all Cash Election Shares or Stock Election
Shares, as applicable, elected by holders of Shares in the First Merger.

 

(e) Each Share eligible to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.6(a)(iv) for which an election shall not have been properly made by
the Election Deadline shall be deemed to be a Mixed Election Share and shall
only be entitled to the right to receive the Mixed Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.6(a)(iv). In no event shall any Mixed Election Shares be
subject to proration pursuant to Section 2.7(c)(ii) or Section 2.7(c)(iv).

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock (A) issued
pursuant to the Offer, (B) issuable pursuant to the First Merger, (C) issuable
pursuant to the Company Warrants, (D) covered by equity awards granted by
Parent pursuant to Section 2.11(b) and Section 2.11(d) and (D) issuable upon
exercise or conversion of all convertible securities assumed by Parent in the
Mergers, constitute such a percentage of the total number of outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock the issuance of which would require any
stockholder action under the NYSE Rules or TSX Rules.

 



14 2.8 Adjustment to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration, Maximum Cash
Shares in Merger, Merger Cash Proration Factor and Merger Stock Proration
Factor shall be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the number of Shares or shares of Parent Common
Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the First Effective Time.
Nothing in this Section 2.8 shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

2.9 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

 

(a) Exchange Fund. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the First Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the holders of the Shares
for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented
thereby. At or immediately after the First Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv) in book-entry form
equal to the aggregate Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration
(excluding any Fractional Share Consideration) and (ii) cash in
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, including the Cash Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.11(g) and the Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.13 (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case,
for the sole benefit of the holders of Shares and holders of Company DSU
awards; _provided_ that no such deposits shall be required to be made with
respect to any Dissenting Shares and any such deposit that is made shall be
returned to Parent upon demand. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient (other than as a result of payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Agreement) to pay the aggregate cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, including the Cash Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.11(g) and the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13, Parent shall promptly deposit,
or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an
amount that is equal to the shortfall that is required to make such payment.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall
make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, including the Cash Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.11(g) and payment of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.13, out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to holders of Shares pursuant to this Section 2\. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

 



15 (b) Procedures for Surrender.

 

(i) _Company Common Stock Certificates_. Promptly after the First Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the First
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and
whose shares of Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv) into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (B) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration into which such Shares have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv), including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section 2.13, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.9(f). Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Section
2, including any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.13, for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the validly surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not required to be paid.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant
to Section 2.6(a)(iv) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall
not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In
lieu thereof, each registered holder of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares
shall

 



16  automatically upon the First Effective Time be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the First Effective Time the applicable Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2, including any
Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.13, for each Share formerly
represented by such Book-Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged
shall be forthwith cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered.

(iii) _Company DSUs._ Any holder of Company DSUs whose Company DSUs were
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.11(g) in exchange for the right to receive
the Cash Consideration shall automatically upon the First Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as set forth in Section 2.11(g), the applicable Cash Consideration
payable to such holder pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.11(g). The
Company shall automatically upon the First Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as set
forth in Section 2.11(g), the applicable Cash Consideration payable to the
Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.11(g).

 

(iv) _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or in respect of any Book-Entry Share.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. At
the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.9, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this Section 2, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.10. If, after the
First Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
Parent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Agreement. 

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following the
twelve-month anniversary of the First Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject
only to the Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable
Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with Section 2.13, payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.9(b),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Parent, the Company, Purchaser, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share two years
after the First Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



17 (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by Parent, an
indemnity bond, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(iv), including any amount payable in
respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section 2.13.

 

(f) Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and
other distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall
be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the valid surrender of
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, following valid surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent,
an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the First Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the First Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock.

2.10 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time
other than shares cancelled in accordance with Section 2.6(a)(i) or Section
2.6(a)(ii), and held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their
respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the time and manner
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the First Effective Time, have
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled only to
payment of the fair value of such Shares as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL in respect of any such shares; _provided_ that if any
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such holders right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the First Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.12), and
such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, of any
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments received by the
Company under Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in (at its own expense) all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the 

 



18  prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands. The Company shall provide each of the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the record date for the purpose of receiving the
notice required by Section 262(d) of the DGCL with the notice contemplated
thereby as part of the Schedule 14D-9.

2.11 Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Company Warrants.

 

(a) Vested Company RSUs. Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, the
portion of each Company RSU award that is then outstanding and either (i)
then vested in accordance with the terms of the Company Equity Plan and award
agreement evidencing such Company RSU award, as applicable or (ii) subject to
accelerated vesting as a result of the completion of the Transactions, shall,
without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the holder
thereof, or any other Person, be settled and paid to such holder in Shares
(net of any Shares equal in value to any applicable Tax to be deducted
or withheld in respect thereof) and such holder shall have the right to
submit an election with respect to such settled and paid Shares in accordance
with the applicable procedures set forth in Section 2.7 hereof. The per-Share
price used for such net settlement and payment shall equal the Cash
Consideration.

(b) Unvested Company RSUs. At the First Effective Time, the portion of each
Company RSU award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time and not covered by Section 2.11(a), shall, without any action
on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the holder thereof, or any
other Person, be cancelled in exchange for a restricted stock unit award
issued, immediately following the First Effective Time, under the Parent
Equity Plan subject to the same vesting schedule (including terms regarding
acceleration of vesting and taking into account the initial grant date and
service with the Company) in effect immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, in each case, covering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (i) the number of Shares
subject to such portion that is not otherwise covered by Section 2.11(a), as
of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the
Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Equity
Award Adjustment Ratio_ " shall mean 1.0229. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary any award issued under the Parent Equity Plan pursuant to
this subsection (b) shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions as
set forth in the cancelled award to the extent such terms and conditions are
required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) Vested Company Options. Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, the
portion of each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised and
either (i) then vested in accordance with the terms of the Company Equity Plan
and award agreement evidencing such Company Option, as applicable or (ii)
subject to accelerated vesting as a result of the completion of the
Transactions (each such portion, a " _Vested Option_ "), shall, without any
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the holder thereof, or
any other Person, be settled and paid to such holder in Shares (net of any
Shares equal in value to the aggregate exercise price thereof and any
applicable Tax to be deducted or withheld in respect thereof) and such holder
shall have the right to submit an election with respect to such settled and
paid Shares in accordance with the applicable procedures set forth in Section
2.7 hereof. The per-Share price used for such net settlement and payment shall
equal the Cash Consideration, and any Vested Option with a per-Share exercise
price that is equal to or greater than the Cash Consideration shall be
cancelled for no consideration.

 



19 (d) Unvested Company Options. At the First Effective Time, the portion of
each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the First Effective Time and is not covered by Section 2.11(c),
shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the
holder thereof, or any other Person, be cancelled in exchange for an option
issued, immediately following the First Effective Time, under the Parent
Equity Plan, subject to the same vesting schedule (including terms regarding
acceleration of vesting and taking into account the initial grant date and
service with the Company) in effect immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, in each case, to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to (w) the number of Shares
subject to such portion that is not otherwise covered by Section 2.11(c), as
of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, multiplied by (x) the Equity
Award Adjustment Ratio, with an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the exercise price per Share for which such
Company Option was exercisable as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, divided by (z) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, to the extent applicable, the exercise price
and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such
converted portion of such Company Options shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case
of any such portion to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise
price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant
to such converted portion shall be determined subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code.

 

(e) Vested LTPP Units. Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, each
Company LTPP Unit award that is then outstanding and either (i) then vested
in accordance with the terms of the Company Equity Plans and award agreement
evidencing such Company LTPP Unit award, as applicable or (ii) subject to
accelerated vesting as a result of the completion of the Transactions, shall,
without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the holder
thereof, or any other Person, be settled and paid to such holder in Shares
(net of any Shares equal in value to any applicable Tax to be deducted
or withheld in respect thereof) and such holder shall have the right to
submit an election with respect to such settled and paid Shares in accordance
with the applicable procedures set forth in Section 2.7 hereof. The per-Share
price used for such net settlement and payment shall equal the Cash
Consideration.

(f) Unvested LTPP Units. At the First Effective Time, each Company LTPP Unit
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time and
not covered by Section 2.11(e) shall, without any action on the part of
Parent, Purchaser, the Company the holder thereof or any other Person, be
cancelled for no consideration.

(g) Company DSUs. Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, each Company
DSU award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company,
the holder thereof, or any other Person, be cancelled in exchange for the
right to receive from Purchaser, without interest, an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of Shares then
subject to such Company DSU award by (ii) the Cash Consideration. Purchaser
shall pay to each

 



20  holder of a Company DSU award the cash amount described in the immediately
preceding sentence, less amounts to be withheld or deducted by the Company for
Taxes, within five (5) business days following the First Effective Time.
Purchaser shall pay the Company the cash amount to be withheld or deducted by
the Company for Taxes, as described in the immediately preceding sentence,
within five (5) business days following the First Effective Time. In
accordance with this Section 2.11(g), the Company shall take all necessary
action to terminate the Companys Executive Deferred Compensation Plan within
30 days prior to the Closing Date in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section
1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B).

(h) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of the awards issuable under the Parent Equity Plan as
described in Section 2.11(b) and Section 2.11(d) and shall (or shall cause
one of its Affiliates to) ensure that the shares of Parent Common Stock
underlying such awards are covered by an effective registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

 

(i) The payments in respect of Company Equity Awards described in this Section
2.11 will be subject to Section 2.12. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) with respect to any Company Equity Award that constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the
extent that payment of the amounts described in this Section 2.11 would
otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, such payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under
the applicable Company Equity Plan and applicable award agreement that will
not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty and (ii) with respect to
Company Equity Awards held by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws
of a country other than the United States, the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith prior to the First Effective Time with the goal of minimizing the
Tax impact of the provisions set forth in this Section 2.11.

 

(j) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, and in any
event prior to the Closing, the Company Board and the Compensation Committee
of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ "), as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and amendments as may be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.11, including resolutions and amendments
terminating the (i) Company Equity Plans, including the following sub-plans
thereunder (i) Long-Term Performance Plan, (ii) Companys Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan, and (iii) Companys Amended and Restated Non-
Employee Director Compensation Policy.

 

(k) Company Warrants. Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, each
Company Warrant that is then outstanding shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the holder thereof, or any other
Person, be settled and paid to such holder in Shares (net of any Shares equal
in value to the aggregate exercise price thereof and any applicable Tax to
be deducted or withheld in respect thereof) and such holder shall have the
right to submit an election with respect to such settled and paid Shares in
accordance with the applicable procedures set forth in Section 2.7. The per-
Share price used for such net settlement and payment shall equal the Cash
Consideration, and any Company Warrant with a per-Share exercise price that is
equal to or greater than the Cash Consideration shall be cancelled for no
consideration.

 



21 2.12 Withholding. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent, Purchaser and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause its agents
to deduct and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it determines are required by any Law to be
deducted and withheld with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

2.13 Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of Shares converted pursuant to the First Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder and Shares underlying vested Company Equity Awards
and Company Warrants) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest,
in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest cent.

2.14 Further Action. If, at any time after the First Effective Time, any
further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

for all Tax periods (or portions of Tax periods) ending on or before

material Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against any Acquired
Corporation which have not been fully paid, or are not being contested in good
faith in appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been
established in accordance with GAAP in the Company SEC Documents, and no
requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending. No
written claim has been received by an Acquired Corporation from any
Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction where an Acquired Corporation does not
file Tax Returns that an Acquired Corporation is or may be subject to Taxes in
that jurisdiction. No Acquired Corporation has a permanent establishment or
is resident for Tax purposes outside of its jurisdiction or territory of
incorporation or formation. No extension or waiver of the limitation period of
the time to assess any material Taxes or to file any Tax Return of the
Acquired Corporations in respect of any material Taxes has been agreed to or
granted which is currently in effect, nor has any such extension or waiver
been requested. No closing agreement, private letter ruling, technical advice
memorandum, advance pricing agreement, consent to an extension of time to
make an election or consent to a change of method of accounting, has been
requested from, entered into with or issued by a Governmental Entity with
respect to any Acquired Corporation. No power of attorney with respect to
Taxes of an Acquired Corporation has been filed by or on behalf of such
Acquired Corporation with any Governmental Entity.

 

(d) None of the Acquired Corporations (i) are bound by any Tax sharing,
allocation or indemnification agreements (other than ancillary provisions in
commercial agreements made in the ordinary course of business, the primary
subject matter of which is not Tax, or agreements solely among the Acquired
Corporations), (ii) have been a member of an affiliated group filing
a consolidated, combined, aggregate or unitary Tax Return (other than a group
the common parent of which was the Company), or (iii) have any liability for

foreign Law), by operation of Law, as a transferee or successor, by Contract
or otherwise.

 

(e) Other than with respect to any "loss transaction" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(5), none of the Acquired Corporations
have entered into any "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Section
6707A(c)(1) of the Code or Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

 



37 (f) None of the Acquired Corporations will be required to include any material
item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable
income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date as a result of any (i) change in or incorrect method of accounting with
respect to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date under
Section 481 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law), (ii) election under Section 108(i) of the Code, (iii) an installment
sale or open transaction occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, (iv) a

of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1502 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law) (i) in the two years prior to the date of this
Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that could otherwise constitute part of a
"plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) that includes the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(h) None of the Acquired Corporations is, nor has any Acquired Corporation
been, a "United States real property holding corporation" (as defined in

Representatives receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was
made or renewed on or after the Agreement Date (and has not been withdrawn)
and did not result from any intentional breach of Section 5.6(a), if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer and that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of members of the Company Board under applicable Laws and
(ii) contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to, or entering
into discussions with, such Person, (A) Parent receives written notice from
the Company of the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to
furnish information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person and (B)
the Company receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of, an

public information concerning any Acquired Corporation that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously made available to Parent or
its Representatives and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations (and, subject to Section 5.6(g), waive such Persons
noncompliance with the provisions of any "standstill" agreement to the extent
(but only to the extent) necessary to permit such discussions) with the Person
or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal.

 



68 (e) Following the Agreement Date, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition

in any event within 24 hours) notice of all material amendments or

connection therewith and (iv) upon the request of Parent, promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) inform Parent of the status of any such Acquisition

look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the

Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith after consultations with
the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of
the Company Board under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Change Recommendation unless the
Company expressly and publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation (A)
in such disclosure or (B) within two Business Days after requested in writing
to do so by Parent following the making of such disclosure and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this Section 5.6(f) shall not permit the Company Board to
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation except in compliance with
Section 6.1 or (iv) communicating with any Person that makes any Acquisition
Proposal (or such Persons Representatives) to the extent necessary to direct

the other Acquired Corporations will, release or permit the release of any
Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any
provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no-hire, "standstill" or
similar agreement or provision to which any of the Acquired Corporations is or
becomes a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has or
acquires any rights and (ii) will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce
or cause to be enforced each such agreement or provision; _provided, however_
, that the Company may release a Person from, or amend or waive any provision
of, any "standstill" agreement or provision if: (A) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the
advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to release
such Person from such agreement or provision or

 



69  the failure to amend such agreement or waive such provision would reasonably
be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of
the Company Board under applicable Laws and (B) the Company provides Parent
with written notice of the Companys intent to take such action at least one
Business Day before taking such action.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

 

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise out of a breach of
Section 5.6) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after
consultation with outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, the Company Board shall have determined, in
good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) the
Company may terminate this Agreement to substantially concurrently therewith
enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer and pay
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3, in each case if and only if: (A)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
members of the Company Board under applicable Laws; (B) the Company shall
have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to

Recommendation or a termination of this Agreement); and (C) (1) pursuant to
such Determination Notice the Company shall have stated that the Company has
received a Superior Offer that did not arise out of a breach of Section 5.6
and made available to Parent the identity of the offeror, a summary of the

Company shall have given Parent the three Business Days after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make other proposals and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and
caused its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with Parent) with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, by Parent (to
the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to determine whether
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement
related to the Transactions such that such Superior Offer will no longer
constitute a Superior Offer hereunder (3) after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and its independent financial
advisors of nationally recognized reputation, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a
Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
members of the Company Board under applicable Laws and (4) if the Company
intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement, the
Company shall have complied with Section 8.1(f). The provisions of
this Section 6.1(b) shall also apply to any material amendment (which shall

Section 6.1(b)(i)), the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation in response to a Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors of
nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
members of the Company Board under applicable Laws; (B) the Company shall have
given Parent a Determination Notice at least three Business Days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) pursuant to
such Determination Notice the Company shall have specified the Change in
Circumstance in reasonable detail including the facts and circumstances that
render a Company Adverse Change Recommendation appropriate in the
determination of the Company Board, (2) the Company shall have given Parent
three Business Days after the delivery of the Determination Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals and shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent (and caused its Representatives to
negotiate in good faith with Parent) with respect to such proposed revisions
or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its independent
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, the Company Board
shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company
Adverse Change Recommendation would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board under
applicable Laws. The provisions of this Section 6.1(b) shall also apply to any
material change in the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in
Circumstance and require a new Determination Notice, except that, in the case
of material changes in the aggregate facts and circumstances relating to such
Change in Circumstance, the references to three Business Days shall be deemed
to be two Business Days.

 



71 6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things required under applicable Antitrust Laws
to consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably
practicable. Each of the Parties shall consult and cooperate with each other

accept any undertaking or condition, to sell, divest or otherwise dispose of,
hold separate, enter into any license or similar agreement with respect to,
restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to sell, divest or otherwise
dispose of, hold separate, enter into any license or similar agreement with
respect to, or restrict the ownership or operation of any assets or
businesses of the Company or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or take
any other action that, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser and Parent,
would reasonably be expected to limit the right of Purchaser or Parent to own
or operate all or any portion of its or the Companys businesses, Company
Products or assets, and (ii) neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any obligation to litigate or sell, dispose of, divest, hold

Parents (or its Affiliates) failure to litigate or sell, dispose of, divest,
hold separate, license, discontinue, limit, restrict, modify or dissolve any
of their assets, properties or lines of business shall not be deemed to be a
breach or default by the Purchaser of this Agreement.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to): (i)
promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement unless the Company and Purchaser agree to extend such 10 Business
Day period) make all filings, notifications or obtain other consents required
to be made or obtained by such Party with the FTC and the Antitrust Division
of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Mergers) as
required by the HSR Act as well as comparable pre-merger notification
filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental Entity that may
be required by other applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) cooperate with each
other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other
filings or notifications or other consents required to be made with, or

Company shall cooperate and work together on (i) the scheduling of, and
strategic planning for, any telephonic or in-person meeting with any
Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws,
and (ii) the process and strategy for resolving any pending or threatened
request, inquiry, or Action brought by a Governmental Entity, or brought by a
third party before any Governmental Entity, in each case with respect to
the Transactions (an " _Antitrust Review_ "). Without limiting the foregoing
sentence and subject to applicable Laws, each Party shall give the other
Parties prompt notice of any Antitrust Review, and each Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) keep the other Parties informed as to the
status of any Antitrust Review, (ii) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with any such request, inquiry, or Action (and if in writing,
furnish the other Party with a copy of such communication), (iii) to the
extent reasonably practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the other
Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity and (iv) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by
any Laws, provide advance notice of each meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity and to have access to and where reasonable be consulted in
advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to be made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity.

(d) The Parties shall promptly furnish to each other all information required
to be included in any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the
rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity in connection with the
applications or other filings to be made under the applicable Antitrust Laws,
other than exhibits or attachments to their respective HSR Notification and
Report forms, which may be withheld from the other Party. Each Party shall
promptly make available its personnel and advisers to such other Party, and,
upon such other Partys request, make such personnel and advisers available
in-person for any in-person meetings with any Governmental Entity, in
connection with (i) the preparation of any filing made by or on their behalf
to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions or (ii) any
Antitrust Review. Parent and the Company shall split all costs in connection
with making filings, notifications or obtaining consents under applicable
Antitrust Laws. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Offer and the Transactions (including the Offer Documents)
or filings to be made under applicable Antitrust Laws, and shall consider
comments reasonably proposed by Parent or the Company, as the case may be;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any documents or materials
required to be filed under applicable Antitrust Laws that contain information
that is confidential or proprietary to the providing Party, such information
may be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside antitrust
counsel for the other Parties; _provided_ that such outside antitrust counsel
shall not disclose such information to such other Parties and shall enter into
a joint defense agreement with the providing Party.

 



73 (e) Without receiving Purchasers prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not (i)
discuss with or commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity any action or
agreement that would in any way limit Purchasers ability to receive the full
benefits of this Agreement, including but not limited to any agreement that
would restrict Purchasers freedom of action with respect to the operation or
ownership of the Company or (ii) commit to or agree with any Governmental
Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under applicable
Antitrust Laws.

6.3 Company ESPP. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions with respect to the Company ESPP such that the current offering in
progress as of the Agreement Date under the Company ESPP shall be the final
offering under the Company ESPP. The Company shall (i) take all
actions necessary such that within twenty (20) days following the Agreement
Date, notice shall be given to participants in the Company ESPP that the date
that is ten (10) days from the date such notice is given shall be the last day
of such offering (the " _Final Purchase_ "); (ii) make such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the final offering but otherwise
treating such final offering as a fully effective and completed offering for
all purposes and (iii) issue all Shares the Company is obligated to issue to
each participant under the Company ESPP for such final offering promptly upon
the close of the Final Purchase (and in any event no later than five (5) days
prior to the Acceptance Time).

6.4 Termination of Company 401(k) Plan. If directed by Parent in writing at
least fifteen (15) Business Days before the First Effective Time, the Company
shall take all necessary actions to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, with
such termination effective as of no later than the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date. If Parent so directs the Company to terminate the
Company 401(k) Plan, then, prior to and conditioned upon termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall take any action necessary to fully vest
any and all unvested amounts of the accounts of all participants in the
Company 401(k) Plan that are impacted by such termination. If Parent so
directs the Company to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, Parent shall permit
each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan who is a Continuing Employee to
make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including any promissory notes
evidencing outstanding loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover
distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan. If
Parent does not so direct the Company to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan,
Parent shall merge the Company 401(k) Plan with and into the Cott DS Services
Retirement Savings Plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") following the Second
Effective Time, which Parent 401(k) Plan shall provide Continuing
Employees benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated Parent service providers.

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement and exculpation by any Acquired
Corporation existing in favor of those Persons who are or were at any time
prior to the First Effective Time directors and officers of any Acquired
Corporation (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the First Effective Time, as provided in the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of such Acquired Corporation (as in effect as of
the Agreement Date) and as provided in the indemnification agreements between
such Acquired 

 



74  Corporation and any such Person (as in effect as of the Agreement Date and
which have been made available to Parent or Parents Representatives) shall
survive the Mergers for a period of six years from the First Effective Time,
and Parent shall ensure that the Acquired Corporations satisfy their
obligations under such certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreements.

 

(b) At or prior to the First Effective Time, the Company may (through a
nationally recognized insurance broker approved by Parent), and if the
Company does not, the Surviving Company shall, purchase a six-year prepaid
"tail" policy on terms and conditions with respect to coverage, deductibles
and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company with respect to acts and omissions occurring prior
to the First Effective Time as of the Agreement Date (a true and complete
copy of which existing policy has been made available by the Company to Parent
or Parents Representatives prior to the Agreement Date); _provided, however,_
that in no event shall the cost of such "tail" policy exceed an aggregate
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the
Company with respect to such policy as of the Agreement Date, it being
understood that if the total premiums payable for such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, the Company or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to
such amount.

 

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Mergers and are
(i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

(e) Parent and the Surviving Company jointly and severally agree to pay all
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnified
Persons in enforcing their indemnity rights and other rights provided in this
Section 6.5.

 

6.6 Securityholder Litigation. Each Party shall promptly (and, in any event,
within 72 hours) notify the other Parties of any stockholder litigation
brought, or threatened, against such Party, any of such Partys Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the Mergers, this
Agreement, the Offer or any of the Transactions. The Company shall control
any Legal Proceeding brought by the stockholders of the Company against the
Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the Mergers, this
Agreement, the Offer or any of the Transactions; _provided_ , that unless, in
the case of any such litigation with respect to the Company, the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has made a Company Change of
Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.6, the Company shall give Parent the
right to review and reasonably comment in advance on all filings or responses
to be made by the Company in connection with any such litigation and the right
to participate (at Parents expense) in such litigation. No settlement of any
such claim or litigation shall be agreed to by any Party without such other
Partys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



75 6.7 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be
a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other (to the extent practicable)
before issuing any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public
statement or making any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not
previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to
the Offer, the Mergers, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation
or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal
announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents or
Parent SEC Documents, as applicable, so long as such statements are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements, (b) each Party may, subject to giving advance notice to the other
Party and giving due consideration to comments timely received from the other
Party, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement as may be required by Law, (d) no Party need consult with the other
Parties in connection with such portion of any press release, public
statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to or in connection with
Section 5.6(f) or in connection with any Company Adverse Change Recommendation
and (e) each Party may, without complying with the foregoing obligations,
issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement
in connection with any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or
the Transactions; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be deemed
to limit or otherwise modify the Companys obligations under Section 5.6 or
Section 6.1.

 

6.8 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes; Consents

 

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective boards of directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate
the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

(b) The Company will give prompt notice to Parent (and will subsequently keep
Parent informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice)
upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or
circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to have any
Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any
of the conditions set forth in Section 7 or Annex I not being able to be
satisfied prior to the End Date. Parent will give prompt notice to the
Company (and will subsequently keep the Company informed on a current basis of
any developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the
occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7 not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8(b)
shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty,
covenant, right, remedy or condition to any obligation hereunder.

  



76 (c) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each
consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any Company Material
Contract by any Acquired Corporation in connection with the Mergers or any of
the Transactions.

of the Company after the Closing, and (ii) a notice in form and substance
required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

(b) Each of the Parties shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to Parents and the Companys respective tax counsels a
customary certificate containing representations reasonably requested by such
counsel in connection with the rendering of any opinion to be issued by such
counsel with respect to the treatment of the acquisition of the Shares
pursuant to the Offer and the Mergers as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code, and the description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of such transactions contained or set forth in the Form S-4. Parents and
Companys respective tax counsels shall be entitled to rely upon such
representations in rendering any such opinions.

 

6.11 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Closing Date, each
of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the other Parties in taking, or
causing to be taken, all actions necessary to enable the delisting by the

Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the First
Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing
Date.

6.12 Employee Matters.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, (i) permit all Company Associates
who remain employees of the Acquired Corporations or who commence employment
with Parent or an Affiliate (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ " and
collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") to participate in the benefit
programs of Parent or its Subsidiaries to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries or (ii) subject to Section
6.4, permit such Continuing Employees to continue participating in the
benefit programs of the Company or its Subsidiaries that were not terminated
by the Company prior to the First Effective Time to the same extent as prior
to the Closing Date.

 



77 (b) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the period
commencing at the First Effective Time and ending six months after the
Closing Date, be provided with an annual rate of base salary or base wage and
an annual target cash bonus opportunity or commission plan that is, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the annual rate of base salary or base wage
and the annual target cash bonus opportunity or commission plan, as
applicable, provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries; provided that if the Continuing Employee is assigned to
a different role within the Parents business, the Continuing Employee shall
be provided with an annual compensation package that is, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than the annual compensation package of Parent employees
similarly situated to the Continuing Employees new role.

(c) Parent shall ensure that, as of the First Effective Time, each Continuing
Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting, benefit accrual, vacation and leave entitlement, and
severance benefits) for service with the Acquired Corporations (or predecessor
employers to the extent any Acquired Corporation provides such past service
credit) to the extent recognized by the Acquired Corporations under the
comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Company, as applicable,
in which Continuing Employees become participants (the " _Parent Plans_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits and
Parent shall not be required to provide credit for such service for
eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual purposes under any Parent Plan that is
an equity compensation plan, defined benefit pension plan or post-retirement
health or welfare plan (excluding, for this purpose, any cash severance
benefits unrelated to health benefits). As of the First Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, credit
to Continuing Employees the amount of unused vacation and sick leave time
that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company Employee Plan as
of the First Effective Time. In addition, (i) each Continuing Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
Parent Plans to the extent coverage under such Parent Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Company Employee Plan, and (ii) with respect to
each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause to be waived
any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-
existing condition limitations under such Parent Plan and (B) cause each
Continuing Employee to be given credit under such Parent Plan for all amounts
paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Employee Plan for
the plan year that includes the First Effective Time for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts
had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plans
for the plan year in which the First Effective Time occurs; provided, however,
Parents obligation under the preceding clause (B) is subject to receipt from
the Company or the applicable insurer of a Company Employee Plan of any
reasonably required information.

 



78 (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to assume
and honor in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the First Effective Time all change in control plans, policies and Contracts
and other arrangements applicable to any current or former employee of the
Company, and all written employment, severance, retention, incentive, change
in control and termination Contracts (including any change in control
provisions therein) between any Acquired Corporation and any current or former
employee of the Company; provided that the Company has disclosed such plans,
policies and Contracts (or forms thereof) in Section 3.13 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and provided copies and a list of participants to Parent.
Parent hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall constitute a "change in control" (or similar term) of the
Company under the terms of the Company Employee Plans, as applicable.

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.12, whether express or implied, shall confer
upon any current or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) of the Acquired Corporations, Parent or Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any third-party beneficiary rights or
any rights to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of
any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.12, and the
Parties confirm that the Acquired Corporations, Parent and Purchaser retain
the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employees at any
time, for any lawful reason, without severance, separation pay or other
payment obligation, except as required by applicable Law or set forth in a
Contract (or form thereof) disclosed in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. No provision of this Section 6.12 is intended to modify, amend or
create any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Acquired Corporations,
Parent or Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
to constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate any such
plan or arrangement.

6.13 Resignations. Subject to Section 6.14, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at or prior to the First
Effective Time (or, at the option of Parent, at a later date) the resignation
of each officer and director of each of the Acquired Corporations, effective
as of the First Effective Time (it being understood that such resignation
shall not constitute a voluntary termination of employment under any
Employment Agreement or Company Employee Plan applicable to such individuals
status as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation and, with respect
to such officers, shall relate solely and exclusively to their constitutional
officer position and not to any position of employment).

 

6.14 Appointment of Company Directors to Parent Board of Directors. If the
Closing Date occurs after, or fewer than ten Business Days before, the
mailing of the Parents proxy materials for its 2020 annual shareholder
meeting, Parent shall appoint two of the current directors of the Company (the
" _Company Appointees_ "), or, if applicable, a Replacement Nominee, to the
Parent Board, which appointment shall be made (i) if the Closing Date occurs
prior to the date of the Parents 2020 annual shareholder meeting, immediately
following the Parents 2020 annual shareholder meeting and (ii) if the
Closing Date occurs on or after the date of the Parents 2020 annual
shareholder meeting, by written consent or special meeting of the Parent Board
immediately after the Closing Date. If the Closing Date occurs at least ten
Business Days prior to the mailing of the Parents proxy materials for its
annual shareholder meeting, then Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
include the Company Appointees, or, if applicable, Replacement Nominee(s), on
the list of nominees for which Parent Board shall solicit proxies at such
meeting (and if such inclusion efforts are not successful, shall appoint the
Company Appointees or, if applicable, Replacement Nominee(s), to the Parent
Board immediately after the 2020 annual shareholder meeting). The Company
Appointees (or, if applicable, Replacement

 



79  Nominee(s)) shall serve until the 2021 annual meeting of the shareholders of
Parent, unless such person earlier resigns or is removed for cause in
accordance with Parents articles of incorporation and bylaws, as applicable.
The Company Appointees shall be Billy D. Prim and Susan E. Cates, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, prior to the First Effective Time, either of the Company
Appointees shall become ineligible to serve on the Parent Board or declines
to serve on the Parent Board, a replacement(s) mutually acceptable to both
Parent and the Company shall replace such Company Appointee (each a "
_Replacement Nominee_ "). The Company Appointees and any Replacement Nominee
shall reasonably cooperate with and promptly respond to customary information
requests from Parent for purposes of such proxy materials.

 

6.15 Name Change; Rebranding.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall
take all action necessary to cause its certificate of incorporation to be
amended to reflect a change in Parents name to "Primo Water Corporation".

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall
commence taking all action necessary to rebrand the business of Parent under
the new name of Parent.

Subsidiaries to, use its (and their) commercially reasonable efforts to, and

required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses of Parent, Holdings,

Financing (including identifying any portion of the information included
therein that constitutes material,

 



80  non-public information); and as promptly as practicable on an ongoing basis
furnishing Parent and its financing sources with (X) all other
financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other information

will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees (including any commitment or
similar fees) or reimburse any expenses prior to the Acceptance Time for which
it has not received prior reimbursement, (B) enter into, or have any material

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Contracts to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them (or any
properties or assets of any of them) is bound. Nothing in this Agreement will
require any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action pursuant to

losses are suffered or incurred directly as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence, or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, in each case, their respective Representatives.

 

(e) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos and other trademarks in connection with the Financing in
a manner that is customary for similar transactions; provided, that such logos
and trademarks are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, and is not
reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their reputation or the goodwill of any of them or of any
of their marks.

6.17 Further Assurances. If, at any time before or after the Acceptance Time,
the Company or Purchaser reasonably believes that any further instruments,
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or

Agreement, the Company and Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause Parent
to, execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments
and assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to

of competent jurisdiction and remain in effect any judgment, temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
preventing the consummation of the Mergers, nor shall there be any pending or
threatened (in writing) Action by any Governmental Entity, or any Law or

83 7.2 Consummation of Offer. Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf) shall

SECTION 8\. TERMINATION

 

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the First Effective
Time:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer (as may be extended in
accordance with this Agreement) shall have expired as a result of the non-
satisfaction of one or more Offer Conditions, or is terminated or withdrawn
prior to the Acceptance Time in accordance with this Agreement, without
Purchaser having accepted for payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if the non-satisfaction of any
such Offer Conditions, termination or withdrawal of the Offer is attributable
to a failure on the part of such Party to perform in any material respect any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such
Party at or prior to the Acceptance Time and such Party has not cured such
failure within 10 days after having received notice thereof from the other
Party;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling, or
shall have taken any other action, having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Mergers or making consummation of the
Offer or the Mergers illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action
shall be final and nonappealable; _provided, however_ , that a Party shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)
if a breach by such Party of any provision of this Agreement shall have been
the primary cause of, or resulted in, such event;

 

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if, whether or not
permitted to do so: (i) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have
made a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or otherwise approved, endorsed
or recommended an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the Company, any Acquired
Corporation or any of their respective Representatives has intentionally and
materially breached any of their respective obligations under Section 5.6
(each of the foregoing " _Triggering Event_ ");

 

(e) by either Parent or the Company if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or prior to the close of business on July 13, 2020 (such date,
the " _End Date_ "); _provided, however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if the failure of
the Acceptance Time to occur prior to the End Date is attributable to the
failure on the part of such Party to perform in any material respect any
covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such
Party;

 



84 (f) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in order to
accept a Superior Offer and, concurrent with such termination, to enter into
a binding written definitive acquisition agreement providing for the
consummation of a transaction constituting a Superior Offer (a " _Specified
Agreement_ "), if (i) the Company has complied in all material respects with
the requirements of Section 5.6 and Section 6.1 with respect to such Superior
Offer, (ii) the Company Board shall have authorized the Company to enter into
such Specified Agreement and (iii) prior to or substantially concurrently
with such termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee as provided in
Section 8.3(b);

 

(g) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) neither Parent
nor Purchaser is in material breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) the
Company shall have breached, failed to perform or violated its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement or (B) any of the representations or
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have
become inaccurate, in either case of clauses (A) or (B), in a manner that
would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions to the Offer set forth
in clauses (b) or (c) of Annex I and such breach, failure to perform,
violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the End Date or, if
capable of being cured by the End Date, is not cured by the Company within
thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such
breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy;

(h) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) the
Company is not in material breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) Parent or
Purchaser shall have breached, failed to perform or violated its covenants or
agreements under this Agreement or (B) any of the representations or
warranties of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall have
become inaccurate, in either case of clauses (A) or (B), which such breach,
failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy (without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect contained
therein) would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, or any other material adverse
effect on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Mergers, prior to the End Date, and in the case
of each of clauses (A) and (B) such breach, failure to perform, violation or
inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the End Date or, if capable of
being cured by the End Date, is not cured by Parent or Purchaser, as
applicable, within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from
the Company of such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy; or

 

(i) by the Company, if (i) the conditions set forth in Annex I have been
satisfied or waived at the Expiration Date (other than those conditions that,
by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time, but subject to
those conditions being able to be satisfied) and (ii) Purchaser shall have
failed to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer
within five Business Days following the Expiration Date; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.1(i) to the contrary, the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(i) during any such five Business Day period.

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the other
Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company or their respective Representatives, stockholders and Affiliates
following any

 



85  such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) this Section 8.2, Section
8.3 and Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall
remain in full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms and (c) the termination of this Agreement
shall not relieve any Party from any liability for common law fraud or,
except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of Section 8.3(b), any
Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the date of termination. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser acknowledge
and agree that any failure of Parent or Purchaser to satisfy its obligation to
accept for payment or pay for Shares following satisfaction of the Offer
Conditions, and any failure of Parent to cause the Mergers to be
effected following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7,
will be deemed to constitute an Willful Breach of this Agreement. Nothing
shall limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or remedies it may
have under Section 9.5(b) in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1.

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.2(a) and in this Section 8.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer
and Merger are consummated.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(e), in each
case, within ten calendar days after the occurrence of a Triggering Event; or

 

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(g), (y) any
Person shall have publicly disclosed an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise
communicated an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board after the Agreement
Date and prior to such termination (unless withdrawn prior to such
termination) and (z) within 12 months of such termination (A) the Company
shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal or consummates such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_
that for purposes of this clause (z) the references to "15%" in the
definition of " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall be deemed to be references
to "50%");

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section
8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i),
prior to or substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
and execution of the Specified Agreement, (y) in the case of Section
8.3(b)(ii), within two Business Days after such termination or (z) in the case
of Section 8.3(b)(iii), upon the earlier to occur of two Business Days after
entry into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
prior to or substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (iii)(z) above; it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein,

 



86  " _Termination Fee_ " means a cash amount equal to $18,940,000.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) and the Company
has paid the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with this Section 8.3,
Parents receipt of the Termination Fee and the payment of any amounts due
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement, and upon payment of such amounts,
no Acquired Corporation and no former, current or future Representative of any
Acquired Corporation shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions.

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the Transactions, that, without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is
not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that shall compensate Parent
and Purchaser in the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

9.1 Amendment. Prior to the First Effective Time, this Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties (as approved by action taken by its board of directors), subject to
Section 9.11.

 

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have
waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege
or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power,
right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given and be subject to Section 9.11.

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, or contained in
any certificate, schedule or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
in connection with any of the Transactions, shall survive the Mergers.

 

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement, the Tender Agreement and
the other agreements and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect;
_provided further_ that, if the First Effective Time occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further
force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute
one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



87 9.5 Applicable Laws; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
Section 9.5(c), in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or
any of the Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom or, if (and only if) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court
of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) and any state appellate
court therefrom or, if (and only if) the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle
County in the State of Delaware and the applicable appellate courts therefrom
(it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in
this Section 9.5(a) shall not constitute general consents to service of
process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the Parties) and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably
consents to service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive
notice in accordance with Section 9.8. The Parties agree that a final judgment
in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Laws;  _provided, however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.5(a) without proof
of the inadequacy of monetary damages or irreparable harm, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
(ii) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3 (A) are not intended to and do
not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (B) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any Partys right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of
specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment of
this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall be void and of
no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that Parent or Purchaser may assign
this Agreement to any of their Affiliates ( _provided_ that such assignment
shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise
impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement);
_provided_ that no such assignment or pledge permitted pursuant to this
Section 9.6 shall relieve Parent or Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Acceptance Time occurs (A)

enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace such
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term

required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or
(ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place
of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any
stockholder who is present.

 



C-1 Section 2.05 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any
purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by the Chairman of the Board (if
any), the President, or by the Board of Directors and shall be called by the
President or Secretary or Board of Directors at the request in writing of a
majority of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders representing a
majority of common stock of the Corporation. Such request shall state the
purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at any
special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the
notice.

Section 2.06 _Notice of Special Meetings_. Unless waived, written notice of a
special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting and the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than 10 days nor more
than 60 days before the date of the meeting.

Section 2.07 _Quorum; Voting_. The holders of a majority of the stock issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for
the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to
vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to
adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement
at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if
after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting. When a quorum is present at any meeting,
except for elections of directors, which shall be decided by plurality vote,
the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power
present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought
before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express
provision of statute or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote
is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control
the decision of such question. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, each stockholder shall at every meeting of stockholders be
entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital
stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no shares shall be
voted pursuant to a proxy more than three years after the date of the proxy
unless the proxy provides for a longer period. If a proxy expressly provides,
any proxy holder may appoint in writing a substitute to act in his or her
place.

Section 2.08 _Action Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing
setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered
to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State, its
principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by
hand or by certified or registered mail,

 



C-2  return receipt requested. No written consent shall be effective to take the
corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty days after the date
of the first delivered consent, written consents signed by a sufficient
number of stockholders to take action are delivered to the Corporation in the
manner required by this Section. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be
given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the
action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the
meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that
written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the
action were delivered to the Corporation.

DIRECTORS

Section 3.01  _Number and Term of Office_. The number of directors of the
Corporation shall be such number as shall be designated from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Corporation
and initially shall be two (2). The directors shall be elected at the annual
meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 3.02 hereof. Each
director elected shall hold office for a term of one year and shall serve
until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal. Directors need not be stockholders.

Section 3.02  _Vacancies_. Vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be
filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall
hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly
elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors
in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided
by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created
directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a
majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such
increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or
stockholders holding at least 10 percent of the total number of the shares at
the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily
order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created
directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in
office.

 

Section 3.03 _Resignations_. Any director may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, if there
is one, the President, or the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect at
the time of receipt thereof or at any later time specified therein; and,
unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation
shall not be necessary to make it effective.

Section 3.04 _Direction of Management_. The business of the Corporation shall
be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors, which may exercise
all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as
are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Amended

done by the stockholders. Such policies and directions may be prescribed from
time to time by the stockholders.

where such election of directors was held or, if notice of such meeting is
given, at the place specified in such notice. Notice of such meeting need not
be given. In the absence of a quorum at said meeting, the same may be held at
any other time and place which shall be specified in a notice given as
hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors, or as
shall be specified in a written waiver signed by the directors, if any, not
attending and participating in the meeting.

may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time

meetings shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, if there is one, or
the President or the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the
written request of two directors.

 

Section 3.09 _Quorum; Voting_. At all meetings of the Board, a majority of the
directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; and at
all meetings of any committee of the Board, a majority of the members of such
committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The act
of a majority of the directors present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof at which there is a quorum present shall be
the act of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be,
except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting
of the Board of Directors or committee thereof, the directors present thereat
may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

Section 3.10 _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to
be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as
the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

Section 3.11 _Participation in Meetings_. One or more directors may
participate in any meeting of the Board or committee thereof by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by which all persons
participating can hear each other.

 



C-4 Section 3.12 _Committees of Directors_. The Board of Directors may designate
one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the
directors of the Corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee. Any such committee, to the extent
provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors or in these Bylaws, shall
have and may exercise all of the powers and authority of the Board of
Directors and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all
papers which may require it, but no such committee shall have the power or
authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or
recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by
the Delaware General Corporation Law to be submitted to stockholders for
approval (other than the election of directors) or (ii) adopting, amending or
repealing any bylaw of the Corporation. Such committee or committees shall
have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution
adopted by the Board of Directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes
of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when requested.

 

Section 3.13 _Compensation of Directors_. Each director shall be entitled to
receive such compensation, if any, as may from time to time be fixed by the
Board of Directors. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed
like compensation for attending committee meetings. Directors may also be
reimbursed by the Corporation for all reasonable expenses incurred
in traveling to and from the place of each meeting of the Board or of any
such committee or otherwise incurred in the performance of their duties as
directors. No payment referred to herein shall preclude any director from
serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor.

ARTICLE 4

 

NOTICES

Section 4.01  _Notices_. Whenever, under the provisions of law or of the
Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is required to be
given to any director or stockholder, such requirement shall not be construed
to necessitate personal notice. Such notice may in every instance be
effectively given by depositing a writing in a post office or letter box, in a
postpaid, sealed wrapper, or by dispatching a prepaid telegram, cable,
telecopy or telex or by delivering a writing in a sealed wrapper prepaid to a
courier service guaranteeing delivery within two (2) business days, in each
case addressed to such director or stockholder, at his or her address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation in the case of a stockholder and at
his or her business address (unless he shall have filed a written request with
the Secretary that notices be directed to a different address) in the case of
a director. Such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time it is so
dispatched. 

Section 4.02 _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever, under the provisions of law or of
the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is required to be
given, a waiver thereof in writing, given by the person or persons entitled to
said notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is
to be given, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Neither the business nor the
purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver. The attendance of a
stockholder or director at the event for which notice is to be given, either
in person or by proxy, shall of itself constitute waiver of notice and waiver
of any and all objections to the place or time of the event, or to the manner
in which it has been called or convened, except, in the case of a stockholder,
when the stockholder attends solely for the purpose of stating, at the
beginning of the meeting, an objection or objections to the transaction of
the business at such meeting.

C-7 ARTICLE 6

 

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

 

Section 6.01 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Actions, Suits or
Proceedings other than those by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Subject
to Sections 6.03 and 6.11, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who
serves or has served as a director or officer of the Corporation and who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was such a
director or officer, or is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea or nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in
a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was
unlawful.

 

Section 6.02 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers in Actions, Suits or
Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation._  Subject to Sections 6.03
and 6.11, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who serves or has served
as a director or officer of the Corporation and who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was such a director or
officer, or is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the
defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good
faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification
shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to
the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or
suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such
expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 



C-8 Section 6.03 _Procedure_. Any indemnification under this Article 6 (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in
the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person
has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 or
Section 6.02, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with
respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such
determination, (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) by a
committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors,
even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors, or if
such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or
(d) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to
former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority
to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however,
that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 or in defense of any
claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the
specific case.

Section 6.04 _Good Faith Defined._ For purposes of any determination under
Section 6.03, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such persons
conduct was unlawful, if such persons action is based on good faith reliance
on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise,
or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation
or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal
counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records
given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The
term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 6.04 shall mean any other
corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this
Section 6.04 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the
circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02, as the case
may be.

Section 6.05 _Indemnification by a Court._ Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under Section 6.03, and notwithstanding
the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply
to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the
extent otherwise permissible under Section 6.01 or Section 6.02. The basis of
such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that
indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in
Section 6.01 or Section 6.02. Neither a contrary determination in the specific
case under Section 6.03 nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall
be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the

 



C-9  director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable
standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to
this Section 6.05 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing
of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or
officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense
of prosecuting such application.

 

Section 6.06 _Expenses Payable in Advance._ Subject to Section 6.11, expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by a current or
former director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding with respect to which indemnification
may be provided under Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 above shall be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in
this Article 6. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by former
directors or officers may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any,
as the Board of Directors deems appropriate, consistent with its obligation to
promptly pay all such expenses actually and reasonably incurred.

 

Section 6.07 _Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Article 6 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses are or at
any time may be entitled under the Delaware General Corporation Law,
the Certificate of Incorporation, any agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the
persons specified in Sections 6.01 and Section 6.02 shall be made to the
fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article 6 shall not be
deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in
Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 but whom the Corporation has the power or
obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or otherwise.

 

Section 6.08 _Insurance._ The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such
capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such
person against such liability under the provisions of this Article 6.

Section 6.09 _Certain Definitions._ For purposes of this Article 6,
references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger with the Corporation which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and

 



C-10  authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agent so that
any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
this Article 6 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such
person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued. For purposes of this Article 6, references to "fines"
shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect of any
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by,
such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Article 6.

 

Section 6.10 _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article 6 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person. Accordingly, unless the context otherwise requires, all
references in this Article 6 to a director or officer shall also include a
former director or officer.

 

Section 6.11 _Limitation on Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses._
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 6 to the contrary, except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed
by Section 6.05), the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Article 6
to indemnify, or advance expenses to, any person in connection with (a) a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors, or (b) proceedings
or claims involving the enforcement of any employment, severance, lock-up,
non-competition, compensation, or other plan or agreement with or of the
Corporation or any of its affiliates to which such person may be a party, or
of which such person may be a beneficiary, or (c) any proceeding with respect
to which final judgment is rendered against such person for payment or an
accounting of profits arising from the purchase or sale by such person of
securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, any similar
successor statute, or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law.

of Directors signed on behalf of the Corporation by any two authorized
officers of the Corporation, representing the number of shares owned by him in
the Corporation. Any or all signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.
In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be

certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed.
When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board
of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to advertise
the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a
bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 7.03 _Transfers of Stock_. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the

transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and
record the transaction upon its books.

Section 7.04 _Fixing Record Date_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation
may fix a record date for the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled
to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, or to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or
to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action. Such record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Directors and such record date shall not be
(i) in the case of such a meeting of stockholders, more than 60 nor less than
10 days before the date of the meeting of stockholders, or (ii) in the case
of consents in writing without a meeting, more than 10 days after the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, or (iii) in other cases, more than 60 days prior to the payment or
allotment or change, conversion or exchange or other action. A determination
of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board
of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

ARTICLE 9

FORUM SELECTION BYLAW 

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative

for "all internal corporate claims". For purposes of this Article 9, "internal
corporate claims" means claims (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty
by a current or former director, officer or stockholder in such capacity or
(ii) as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers
jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, except for, as to each of (i) and
(ii) above, any claim (an "Alternative Court Claim") as to which the Court of
Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction
of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court
of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. In the case of an
Alternative Court Claim, unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, all internal corporate claims shall be
submitted to any federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware
having jurisdiction over all indispensable parties and having subject matter
jurisdiction with respect to such Alternative Court Claim

SECTION 7. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

 

Each of Parent and Purchaser hereby, jointly and severally, represents and
warrants to Stockholder as follows:

 

7.1 Authorization, etc. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Stockholder, constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against Parent
and Purchaser in accordance with their terms, subject to the Enforceability
Limitations. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it was organized. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Purchaser is owned directly or indirectly by Parent.

 

7.2 No Conflicts or Consents. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent
and Purchaser and their respective Representatives will not: (a) violate any
law, rule, regulation, order, decree or judgment applicable to Parent and
Purchaser (or any of such Representatives) or by which Parent or Purchaser
(or any of such Representatives) or any of their respective properties is or
may be bound, except for any conflict or violation which would not adversely
affect in any material respect the ability of Parent or Purchaser to perform
its obligations hereunder or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
or (b) require any filing with, nor any permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any Person or require any consent of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity, other than (i) any
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, NASDAQ, and the DGCL, (ii) as
required by Antitrust Laws, (iii) as contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(including schedules thereto), and (iv) where the failure to obtain such
consents or approvals or to make such filings, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the performance by Parent or
Purchaser of their obligations under this Agreement.

  



II-7 SECTION 8. COVENANTS OF STOCKHOLDER

 

8.1 Stockholder Information. Stockholder hereby agrees to permit Parent and
Purchaser to publish and disclose in the Offer Documents Stockholders
identity and ownership of the Subject Securities and the nature of
Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this
Agreement.

 

8.2 Further Assurances. From time to time and without additional
consideration, Stockholder shall (at Parents sole expense) execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional transfers,
assignments, endorsements, consents and other instruments, and shall (at
Parents sole expense) use its reasonable best efforts to take such further
actions, in each case, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
carrying out this Agreement.

8.3 Public Announcement. Stockholder shall not, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not to, issue any press
release or make any public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the approval of Parent (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in each case, except
as may be required by applicable Law (provided that reasonable notice of any
such disclosure will be provided to Parent, and Stockholder will consider in
good faith the reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such
disclosure). Stockholder hereby (i) consents to and authorizes the publication
and disclosure by Parent, Purchaser and the Company (including in the Schedule
TO, the Schedule 14D-9 or any other publicly filed documents relating to the
Merger, the Offer or the Transactions) of: (a) Stockholders identity; (b)
Stockholders ownership of the Subject Securities; and (c) the nature of
Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this
Agreement and (ii) agrees as promptly as practicable to notify Parent,
Purchaser and the Company of any required corrections with respect to
any written information supplied by Stockholder specifically for use in any
such disclosure document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
limit or affect any actions taken by Stockholder (or any of its
Representatives) in compliance with the Merger Agreement.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

 

9.1 Adjustments. In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, (a) the number of issued and outstanding Subject Securities
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Subject
Securities changes as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, or (b)
Stockholder shall become the beneficial owner of any additional Shares, then
the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the Shares held by Stockholder
immediately following the effectiveness of the events described in clause (a)
or Stockholder becoming the beneficial owner thereof as described in clause
(b), as though, in either case, they were Subject Securities hereunder. In
the event that Stockholder shall become the beneficial owner of any other
securities entitling the holder thereof to vote or give consent with respect
to the matters set forth in Section 4 hereof, then the terms of Section 4
hereof shall apply to such other securities as though they were Subject
Securities hereunder.

incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

9.4 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement 

 



II-9  shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties agree
to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and
enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision.

 

9.5 Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement and any other documents
delivered by the parties in connection herewith constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Any provision of
this Agreement may be amended only if such amendment is in writing and signed
by each party to this Agreement.

9.6 Assignment; Binding Effect. No party may assign (by merger, operation of
Law or otherwise) either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties;
_provided,_ that each of Parent or Purchaser may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of
Parent without the consent of Stockholder, but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
will be void _ab initio_.

 

9.7 Independence of Obligations. Stockholder is signing this Agreement solely
in Stockholders capacity as a stockholder of the Company and not, if
applicable, in any other capacity (including Stockholders capacity as a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Acquired Corporation, as
applicable). The covenants and obligations of Stockholder set forth in this
Agreement shall be construed as independent of any other agreement or
arrangement between Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Company or Parent,
on the other. The existence of any claim or cause of action by Stockholder
against the Company or Parent shall not constitute a defense to the
enforcement of any of such covenants or obligations against Stockholder.

9.8 Governing Law.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
Section 9.8(c), in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
any state appellate court therefrom or, if (and only if) such the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division) and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (and only
if) the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division)
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, the United States
District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and the
applicable appellate courts therefrom (it being agreed that the consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.8(a) shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in

 



II-10  the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
Person other than the parties hereto) and (ii) each of the parties hereto
irrevocably consents to service of process by first class certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at which such party
is to receive notice in accordance with Section 9.3. The parties agree that a
final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that
the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.8(a) without proof of
the inadequacy of monetary damages or irreparable harm, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (ii)
the right of specific performance is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and without that right, none of the parties hereto would
have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy
at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.8(b) shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such order or injunction.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

9.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties
need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement by portable document format (PDF) or other
electronic transmission, including by e-mail attachment, shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

9.10 Waiver. No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
such party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power,

 



II-11  right, privilege or remedy. No party shall not be deemed to have waived any
claim available to it arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy of it under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such
claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and any such
waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

9.11 Termination. This Agreement and all rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder shall automatically terminate, and no party shall have any
rights or obligations hereunder and thereunder, and this Agreement shall be
revoked and become null and void on, and have no further effect as of, the
Expiration Date (other than this Article IX). Nothing in this Section 9.11
shall relieve any party from any liability for any willful, knowing and
material breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 

9.12 Directors and Officers. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict a director or
officer of the Company in the taking of any actions (or failure to act) in his
or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any Acquired
Corporation, or in the exercise of his or her fiduciary duties in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any Acquired Corporation,
or prevent or be construed to create any obligation on the part of any
director officer of the Company or any Acquired Corporation from taking any
action in his or her capacity as such director or officer.

9.13 Construction.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include masculine and feminine genders.

 

(b) The parties agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not
be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 

(d) Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires: (i) all
references in this Agreement to "Sections" and "Exhibits" are intended to
refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits to this Agreement; and (ii)
the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder," and words of similar import,
shall be construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement.

(e) The captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be
referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement.

 



II-12 9.14 No Ownership Interest. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and
relating to the Subject Securities Owned by Stockholder at a given time shall
remain vested in and belong to Stockholder as of such time, and Parent shall
have no authority to exercise any power or authority to direct Stockholder in
the voting of any of the Subject Securities, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein.
