in all respects its obligations to any of its current or former directors and
officers as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the
Company Charter Documents as in effect on the Agreement Date and pursuant to
any indemnification agreements between Company and such Company Indemnified
Parties existing as of the Agreement Date (the " _Company Indemnification
Provisions_ "), with respect to claims arising out of matters occurring at or

shall survive such anniversary until the final resolution thereof. The
Surviving Corporation shall retain or include in its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws indemnification provisions, including provisions
respecting the advancement of expenses, that are at least as favorable to the

immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Company
Indemnified Parties, and, during such six (6) year period, such provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any respect (except to
the extent that such amendment preserves, increases or broadens the
indemnification or other rights theretofore available to the Company
Indemnified Parties or as required by Applicable Law).

(b) Each of Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate,
in the defense of any action requiring indemnification under this _Section

requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

period of six (6) years following the Closing Date and will continue in
effect thereafter with respect to any proceeding or claim commenced or
asserted, as applicable, prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.
The provisions of this _Section 6.1_ are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties.

6.2 _Acquirer Compliance With Earn Out_. Acquirer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

10.1 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. If the Merger is
consummated, the representations and warranties of Company, Arrowhead,
Acquirer and Sub contained in this Agreement shall expire and be of no further
force or effect as of and following the Effective Time, and only such
covenants and agreements of Acquirer and Company in this Agreement that by
their terms survive the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the expiration of the
representations and warranties of Arrowhead have the effect of precluding
Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation from asserting a claim for fraud,
including fraud in the inducement.

10.2 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. The internal laws of the
State of California, irrespective of its choice of law principles, will govern
the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the
interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties
hereto. Each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the personal jurisdiction of
any state or federal court sitting in Santa Clara County, California in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, including but not
limited to a motion for forum of non conveniens or other actions or other
motions asserting the aforementioned forum is inconvenient (and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto), (c) agrees that all claims in respect of the action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, and (d) agrees not
to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any other court. Any party may make service on another party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at  the address and in the manner provided for giving of notices in Section
10.7. Nothing in this Section 10.2, however, will affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

10.3 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance and injunctive relief as a remedy to prevent breaches of
this Agreement, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state or country having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The provisions of this Section 10.3 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Company Stockholders. 

10.4 _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns_. No party hereto may
assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that any party,
without the consent of any other party hereto, assign this Agreement and the
Acquirer Ancillary Agreements (a) to any of its majority-owned Subsidiaries,
(b) by operation of law, or (c) in connection with any merger, consolidation
or sale of all or a significant portion of its assets or in connection with
any similar transaction. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section 10.4 will be void.

 

10.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, is for any reason held to any extent to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement and the application
thereof will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the maximum extent legally
permissible, the economic, business and other purposes of such provision.

10.6  _Amendment and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except by a written instrument signed by Acquirer, Sub, and Company. This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto as provided in this Section
10.6 at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after such approval, no amendment
will be made that by Applicable Laws requires the further approval of the
Company Stockholders without obtaining such further approval. At any time
prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and Acquirer, by action taken by
its Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
contained herein or in any agreement, certificate or document delivered
pursuant hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to it contained herein or in any agreement, certificate or
document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for its benefit contained herein or in any agreement,
certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto. No such extension
or waiver will be effective unless signed in writing by the party against
whom such extension or waiver is asserted. The waiver by a party of any breach
hereof or default in the performance hereof will not be deemed to constitute a
waiver of any other breach or default or any succeeding breach or default.
The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof will not be
construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such
provisions. 10.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications required or permitted
under this Agreement will be in writing and will be either hand delivered in
person, sent by facsimile, sent by certified or registered first-class mail,
postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier service.
Such notices and other communications will be effective upon receipt if hand
delivered or upon confirmation if sent by facsimile, five (5) calendar days

counterparts, each of which will be an original as regards any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together will constitute one and
