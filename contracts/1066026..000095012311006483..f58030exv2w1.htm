 1.9 _Effect on Capital Stock, Options and Warrants_. 

  

 (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of any holder of the Company Capital Stock, Company Options and/or Company Warrants: 

  

 (i) _Company Common Stock_. At the First Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares owned by the Company) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with _Section 1.1(c)_, (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Per Share Closing Cash Amount, (B) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Per Share Closing Share Amount, (C) an amount of cash (without interest), upon distribution of the Top-Up Cash Consideration and subject to _Section 1.9(b)_ and _Article VIII_, equal to the Per Share Top-Up Cash Amount (subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 1.9(b)_ ), (D) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, upon release of the Escrow Shares and subject to _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement, equal to the Per Share Escrow Share Amount, and (E) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, upon distribution of the Total Top-Up Shares and subject to _Section 1.9(b)_, equal to the Per Share Top-Up Share Amount (subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 1.9(b)_). The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock each Company Stockholder is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and computed after aggregating all shares of Company Common Stock that are represented by a particular stock certificate held by such Company Stockholder. The amount of cash each Company Stockholder is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company Common Stock represented by a particular stock certificate held by such Company Stockholder. 

  

 (ii) _Unvested Company Shares_. The shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable and cash payable pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)(i)_ in exchange for Company Capital Stock that immediately prior to the First Effective Time constituted Unvested Company Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Unvested Company Shares immediately prior to or at the First Effective Time, and no vesting acceleration shall occur by reason of the Merger or any subsequent event, such as termination of employment (except as specifically set forth herein or pursuant to a Benefits Waiver). Therefore, shares of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable and cash otherwise payable pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)(i)_ in exchange for such Unvested Company Shares ("Unvested Acquiror Shares" and "Unvested Acquiror Cash", respectively) shall not automatically be distributable by Acquiror at the First Effective Time, and shall instead become distributable by Acquiror on the date that such Unvested Company Shares would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the First Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule), less (in the case of Unvested Acquiror Shares) any amount of such newly vested shares which vest in escrow in accordance with _Section 1.1(c)(iii)_. For administrative convenience, Acquiror may in its discretion make all such required distributions to holders of Unvested Acquiror Shares and Unvested Acquiror Cash no later than the 15th day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which such Unvested Acquiror Shares and Unvested Acquiror Cash becomes vested, and in its discretion may make such distributions through an agent authorized by Acquiror to administer such issuances on Acquirors behalf. All amounts distributable pursuant to this _Section 1.9(a)(ii)_ shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest. A portion of such newly vested cash so paid will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. At the First Effective Time, all outstanding rights to repurchase Unvested Company Shares that the Company may hold or similar restrictions in the Companys favor immediately prior to the First Effective Time (all such 

   ##### 

  

 

rights, the "Repurchase Rights") shall be assigned to Acquiror in the First
Merger, without any action required on the part of any Person, and shall
thereafter be exercisable by Acquiror upon the same terms and subject to the
same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, except that Repurchase Rights may be exercised by Acquiror retaining
either the Unvested Acquiror Shares or Unvested Acquiror Cash (as the case
may be) into which such Unvested Company Shares have been converted, and
paying to the former holder thereof the repurchase price in effect for each
such Unvested Company Share subject to that Repurchase Right
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No Unvested Acquiror Shares or
Unvested Acquiror Cash, or the right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered,
sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law),
by any Person, other than Acquiror, or be taken or reached by any legal
or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior
to the issuance or payment to such Person of such Unvested Acquiror Shares or
Unvested Acquiror Cash following the vesting thereof, in accordance with this
Agreement. 

   

 (iii) _Vested Company Options_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, each Vested Company Option that is issued, outstanding, vested and exercisable immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be terminated and automatically converted into the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option, subject to and in accordance with _Section 1.1(c)_, (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Per Share Closing Cash Amount less the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested Company Option, (B) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Per Share Closing Share Amount, (C) an amount of cash (without interest), upon distribution of the Top-Up Cash Consideration and subject to _Section 1.9(b)_ and _Article VIII_ , equal to the Per Share Top-Up Cash Amount (subject to adjustment as provided in  _Section 1.9(b)_), (D) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, upon release of the Escrow Shares and subject to _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement, equal to the Per Share Escrow Share Amount, and (E) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, upon distribution of the Total Top-Up Shares and subject to _Section 1.9(b)_, equal to the Per Share Top-Up Share Amount (subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 1.9(b)_); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Entity and Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such payment made to the holder of a Vested Company Option the amount of withholding for Taxes required to be deducted and withheld as a result of the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 1.9(a)(iii)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that at the election of such Company Optionholder, any withholding for Taxes applicable to the shares described in clause (D) shall be satisfied by withholding shares of Acquiror Common Stock that would otherwise be released to the Company Optionholder with a value equal to the amount of such withholding Taxes. The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock each Company Optionholder is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to Vested Company Options held by such Company Optionholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and computed after aggregating all shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to a particular Vested Company Option held by such Company Stockholder. The amount of cash each Company Optionholder is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to Vested Company Options held by such Company Optionholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company Common Stock represented by a particular Vested Company Option held by such Company Stockholder. All Vested Company Options shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished at the First Effective Time. 

  

 (iv) _Unvested Company Options_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option that is issued and outstanding, immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be terminated and automatically substituted and converted into the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option, an Acquiror restricted stock unit ("Acquiror RSU") granted under Acquirors 2007 Equity Incentive Plan for an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the 

   ##### 

  

 

quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Unvested Company Options Per Share Value
less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option, by (B)
the Acquiror Closing Stock Price. The number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock subject to each Acquiror RSU each Company Optionholder is entitled to
receive for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to Unvested Company
Options held by such Company Optionholder shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole share (with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated
by such rounding) and computed after aggregating all shares of Company Common
Stock that are subject to a particular Unvested Company Option held by such
Company Stockholder. Each such Acquiror RSU shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of Acquirors 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and the Acquiror award
agreement for such Acquiror RSU, but shall continue to have, and be subject
to, substantially the same (or more favorable) vesting schedule (excluding
acceleration terms) set forth in the applicable stock option agreement as is
in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time (except to the
extent otherwise provided in the Acquiror New Hire Package, Acquiror award
agreement for such Acquiror RSU and/or the Benefits Waiver, as applicable),
except that the shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such Acquiror RSU
shall vest and settle as follows  (1) on March 15, 2011, such Acquiror
RSU shall (x) vest and settle with respect to the shares that would have
vested from the Closing Date until March 15, 2011, (y) receive six months
worth of accelerated vesting (i.e., the remaining vesting schedule will be
shortened by six months), and (z) following the effectiveness of
such accelerated vesting, vest and settle with respect to the shares that
would have vested from March 15, 2011 through July 14, 2011, and (2)
thereafter, such Acquiror RSU shall vest and settle on each July 15, October
15, January 15 and March 15 (it being understood that on each such vesting
date, the shares that would have vested according to the original vesting
schedule between such vesting date and the next subsequent vesting date shall
vest); _provided_ , _however_ , that any withholding for Taxes applicable to
the Acquiror RSUs shall be satisfied by withholding shares of Acquiror Common
Stock that would otherwise be issued when the Acquiror RSUs are settled with
a value equal to the amount of such withholding Taxes; _provided_ , _further_
, that the vesting acceleration described in sub-clause (y) above shall be
contingent on the holder of such Unvested Company Option executing a release
of claims he or she may have with respect to the treatment of such Company
Optionholders Company Options in the Merger. Consistent with the terms of
the Company Option Plans and the documents governing the outstanding Unvested
Company Options under such plan as in effect on the Agreement Date, the
Merger shall not accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such options or
the shares of Acquiror Common Stock which shall be subject to Acquiror RSUs
upon Acquirors substitution and conversion of such options in the
Merger (except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement). Promptly after
the Closing Date, Acquiror shall issue to each Person who immediately prior
to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding Unvested Company Option
an award agreement evidencing the foregoing substitution and conversion of
such option by Acquiror. All Unvested Company Options shall, by virtue of the
First Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished at the First Effective Time. 

   

 (v) _Company Warrants_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is issued, outstanding, vested and exercisable immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be terminated and automatically converted into the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, subject to and in accordance with _Section 1.1(c)_, (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Per Share Closing Cash Amount less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Warrant, (B) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Per Share Closing Share Amount, (C) an amount of cash (without interest), upon distribution of the Top-Up Cash Consideration and subject to _Section 1.9(b)_ and _Article VIII_, equal to the Per Share Top-Up Cash Amount (subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 1.9(b)_), (D) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, upon release of the Escrow Shares and subject to  _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement, equal to the Per Share Escrow Share Amount, and (E) an amount of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, upon distribution of the Total Top-Up Shares and subject to _Section 1.9(b)_, equal to the Per Share Top-Up Share Amount 

   ##### 

  

 

(subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 1.9(b)_); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Surviving Entity and Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from such payment made to the holder of a Company Warrant the
amount of withholding for Taxes required to be deducted and withheld as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 1.9(a)(v)_. The
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock each Company Warrantholder is
entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to
Company Warrants held by such Company Warrantholder shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole share and computed after aggregating all shares of Company
Common Stock that are subject to a particular Company Warrant held by such
Company Warrantholder. The amount of cash each Company Warrantholder is
entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company
Warrants held by such Company Warrantholder shall be rounded to the nearest
cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company
Common Stock represented by a particular Company Warrant held by such Company
Warrantholder. All Company Warrants shall, by virtue of the First Merger and
without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and extinguished at the First Effective Time. 

   

 (vi) _Capital Stock of Tolo One Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Tolo One Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time will, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on the part of the sole stockholder of Tolo One Sub, be converted into and become one share of Company Common Stock (and the shares of the Company into which the shares of Tolo One Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Companys capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the First Effective Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Tolo One Sub capital stock will evidence ownership of such shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 (b) _Top-Up Payment_. 

  

 (i) _Payment_. If, on the Top-Up Measurement Date, the Top-Up Actual Value is less than the Top-Up Guaranteed Value, Acquiror shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Top-Up Measurement Date, pay to each Effective Time Holder, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time, or subject to a Vested Company Option or Company Warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time, held by such holder, (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Top-Up Cash Amount by (B) the Top-Up Holding Percentage for such holder, and (2) a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Top-Up Share Amount by (B) the Top-Up Holding Percentage for such holder (collectively, the "Top-Up Payments"), in each case subject to this _Section 1.9(b)_ and any setoff rights of Acquiror under _Article VIII_. If the Stockholders Agent believes Top-Up Payments will be required hereunder, then on the Top-Up Measurement Date, the Stockholders Agent will deliver to Acquiror a certified supplement to the Spreadsheet setting forth the Top-Up Holding Percentage for each Effective Time Holder, which supplement shall be accompanied by such supporting documentation, information and calculations as are necessary for Acquiror to verify and determine the calculations set forth therein; Acquiror will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause its internal stock administrator (if any) and transfer agent to provide the Stockholders Agent with such information in their possession as may be reasonably necessary for the Stockholders Agent to prepare such supplement to the Spreadsheet (provided such information is not reasonably obtainable by the Stockholders Agent directly from the Effective Time Holders). Effective Time Holders will promptly notify Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent in writing with the details of any sale, transfer (including any Permitted Top-Up Transfer), Permitted Top-Up Hedge or other disposition of Acquiror Merger Shares (including a non-Permitted Top-Up Hedge) as a condition to eligibility to receive Top-Up Payments with respect to the Acquiror Merger Shares subject to such notice. Acquiror will not be required to make any Top-Up Payments until after it has received such supplement to the Spreadsheet. No Top-Up Payment, or the 

   ##### 

  

 

right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred
(including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, or be taken or
reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability of
such Person, prior to the payment to such Person of such Top-Up Payment in
accordance with this Agreement. For clarity, no Top-Up Shares will
be eligible to receive any cash Top-Up Payment. 

   

 (ii) _Termination of Right to Top-Up Payments_. The Effective Time Holders right to receive the Top-Up Payment pursuant to _Section 1.9(b)(i)_ shall terminate immediately if on any trading day prior to the Top-Up Measurement Date, the Top-Up Trigger Value exceeds the Top-Up Guaranteed Value; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent an Effective Time Holder at that time (1) holds any Unvested Acquiror Shares, (2) has a right to receive any Escrow Shares which are not then released from the Escrow Fund, (3) holds any Acquiror Merger Shares that it is precluded by any insider trading policy of Acquiror to which it is bound from freely transferring, or (4) holds any Acquiror Merger Shares that it is precluded by applicable law or regulation from freely transferring (in each case, "Restricted Acquiror Merger Shares"), the Effective Time Holders right to receive the Top-Up Payment pursuant to _Section 1.9(b)(i)_ shall terminate with respect to any such Restricted Acquiror Merger Shares only if the Top-Up Trigger Value equals or exceeds the Top-Up Guaranteed Value at any time after such Restricted Acquiror Merger Shares become vested or are released from the Escrow Fund, or such Restricted Acquiror Merger Shares becomes freely transferable, as applicable. In addition, as set forth in the Escrow Agreement, Acquiror reserves the right to in its sole discretion unilaterally instruct the Escrow Agent to release Escrow Shares from the Escrow Fund prior the expiration of the Escrow Period. 

  

 (iii) _Additional Limitations_. For clarity, any Acquiror Merger Shares which have been sold or otherwise transferred by an Effective Time Holder (including any shares made subject to any pledge, option, hedging, forward purchase or other Contract pursuant to which the economic consequences of ownership of the Acquiror Merger Shares have been transferred (other than a Permitted Top-Up Hedge)) shall thereupon become permanently ineligible to receive any Top-Up Payment (and hence are excluded from the numerator in the calculation of the Top-Up Holding Percentage). In addition, as set forth in the Addendum to the Acquiror New Hire Package for certain of the Key Employees, any Acquiror Merger Shares held by any such Key Employee will become permanently ineligible to receive any Top-Up Payment in the event that prior to the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date, (1) such Key Employee voluntarily terminates his employment with Acquiror or any subsidiary thereof for any reason or no reason, or (2) Acquiror or any subsidiary thereof terminates the employment of such Key Employee for Cause (as such term is defined in the Addendum). As used herein, a "Permitted Top-Up Hedge" means a hedging transaction of the type set forth on _Schedule 1.9(b)(iii)_ hereto. 

  

 (iv) _Permitted Transfers_. Notwithstanding _Section 1.9(b)(iii)_, in the event that a particular Effective Time Holder is organized as a venture capital or private equity fund partnership, the transfer of Acquiror Merger Shares without consideration to (1) other venture capital or private fund partnerships within the same fund family under common management or (2) limited partner investors in such partnership shall not cause such transferred Acquiror Merger Shares to become ineligible to receive any Top-Up Payment (a "Permitted Top-Up Transfer");  _provided_ , that as a condition to any such permitted transfer (x) such Effective Time Holder transferor shall notify Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent of all the relevant details regarding such transfer (including the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the transferee and the number of Acquiror Merger Shares transferred to such transferee) and (y) such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this _Section 1.9(b)_ (it being understood that the transferor will continue to remain liable for purposes of _Article VIII_). For purposes of calculating the Top-Up Holding Percentage for any such transferee, the relevant holding period shall be deemed to run from the date of transfer through the Top-Up Measurement Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company_. At the First Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

  

 (d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital Stock or Acquiror Common Stock occurring after the Agreement Date, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change. 

  

 (e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration amounts provided for in _Section 1.9(a)_, but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Delaware Law and/or California Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of Delaware Law and/or California Law, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with Delaware Law and/or California Law (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the First Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_ in respect of such shares as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Acquiror shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in _Section (c)_ , following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in  _Section (c)_ , the amount of consideration to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under _Section 1.9(a)_ as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal or purchase received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and/or California Law and received by the Company and (ii) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for purchase under Delaware Law and/or California Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror (not to be unreasonably withheld), or as otherwise required under Delaware Law and/or California Law, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. The payout of consideration under this Agreement to the Company Stockholders (other than to holders of Dissenting Shares who shall be treated as provided in this _Section 1.9(e)_ and under Delaware Law and/or California Law) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of appraisal rights or dissenters rights under Delaware Law and/or California Law by any other Company Stockholder. 

  

 (f) _Rights Not Transferable_. The rights of the Company Stockholders as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time are personal to each such stockholder and shall not be transferable for any reason otherwise than for a Permitted Top-Up Transfer or by operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted transfer of such right by any holder thereof (otherwise than as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void. 

  

 (g) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the First Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock (after 

   ##### 

  

 

aggregating for each particular stock certificate representing Company Capital
Stock all fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be received by such
holder) shall receive from Acquiror an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Acquiror
Closing Stock Price. 

   

 (h) _Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, (i) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and (ii) the unit of ownership interest in Tolo Two Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will continue to constitute the one validly issued unit of the Surviving Entity. Such unit shall be the only unit of the Surviving Entity that is issued and outstanding immediately after the Second Effective Time. 

  

 1.10 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Acquirors transfer agent, Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger. 

  

 (b) _Acquiror to Cause Deposit of Consideration_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within five Business Days thereafter, Acquiror or a direct or indirect subsidiary of Acquiror shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_, through such reasonable procedures as Acquiror may adopt, (i) the shares of Acquiror Common Stock and cash issuable pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_, less the Escrow Shares to be deposited into an escrow fund in connection herewith pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.10(c)_ and _Article VIII_ and excluding the Total Top-Up Cash Consideration (if any) and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of any related fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.9(g)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Unvested Acquiror Shares or Unvested Acquiror Cash that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights or other restrictions, including without limitation under a Benefits Waiver, shall be withheld by Acquiror (and reflected in book entry form in the case of Unvested Acquiror Shares) for delivery following the lapse of such vesting and/or repurchase rights or other restrictions. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (i) Promptly following the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall mail to every holder of record of Company Capital Stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time: (A) a letter of transmittal in the form supplied by Acquiror (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (B) instructions for use of the Letter of Transmittal in effecting the surrender of certificates or instruments which immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company Capital Stock that were converted into the right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) and cash pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_ (the "Certificates") in exchange for certificates (or book entries in the case of shares of Unvested Acquiror Shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights or other restrictions) representing such shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) and cash. The Letter of Transmittal shall specify that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt thereof by the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, duly executed on behalf of each Person effecting the surrender of such Certificates, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify, including that the Effective Time Holders agree to be bound by the provisions of _Section 1.10(c)_ and _Article VIII_ of this Agreement. 

  

 (ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of

right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_ in respect of such Certificate
(and a check representing any related payment in lieu of fractional shares

 (iii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent, the Total Escrow Shares. In the case of any Company Stockholder that is a holder of Unvested Company Shares as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, the Escrow Shares contributed to the Escrow Fund by such Company Stockholder shall, to the maximum extent possible, consist of vested shares of Acquiror Common Stock and any Unvested Acquiror Shares placed in escrow shall vest first before any non-escrowed Unvested Acquiror Shares. The Total Escrow Shares shall constitute partial security for the indemnification obligations of such Effective Time Holders pursuant to _Article VIII_, and shall be held in escrow and distributed from escrow in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquiror Common Stock with a record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate as of such record date with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable to such holder in exchange for such Certificate until the applicable delivery requirements with respect to such Certificate as set forth in _Section 1.10(c)_ shall have been satisfied. Subject to applicable law, and subject to satisfaction of the applicable delivery requirements with respect to such Certificate set forth in _Section 1.10(c)_, there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in exchange for such Certificate, without interest, as soon as reasonably practicable after the time of the satisfaction of such delivery requirements, the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the First Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this _Section 1.10(d)_) with respect to such shares of Acquiror Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Acquiror Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Acquiror or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of Acquiror Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Acquiror or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

   ##### 

  

 

Effective Time shall promptly be paid or delivered, as appropriate, to
Acquiror, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate who has not theretofore
complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by
_Section 1.10(c)_ shall look only to Acquiror (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and similar laws), only as a general unsecured
creditor thereof, for its claim for shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock and any dividends
or distributions (with a record date after the First Effective Time) with
respect to Acquiror Common Stock) and cash to which it is
entitled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date on which the merger
consideration contemplated by _Section 1.9_ in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Acquiror, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Capital Stock_.

If, after the First Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Company or the Surviving Entity for any reason, such Certificate shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_. 

  

 1.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit of that fact by the record holder thereof, such consideration as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.9_ in respect of such Certificate;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the record holder of such Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum or execute an indemnification agreement as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Acquiror, the Company, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their respective representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 1.13 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. However, Acquiror makes no representations or warranties to the Company or to any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants regarding whether the Merger will qualify as a tax-free "reorganization" under the Code or any of the Tax consequences to the Company or any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that the Company and the holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated hereby. 

  

 1.14 _Withholding Rights_. Acquiror, the Company, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock, any Company Options or any Company Warrants such amounts as Acquiror, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such holders in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the Second Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with full right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the manager of the Surviving Entity are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

contemplated by this Agreement, in and of itself, would reasonably
be expected to result in the release from escrow of any Company Source

with respect to such Company Employee Plan for the most recent fiscal year
included in the Financial Statements. No Company Employee Plan will be
subject to any surrender fees or service fees upon termination other than the

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity, is required by or with respect to Acquiror, Tolo One Sub or Tolo Two Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the First Certificate of Merger and Second Certificate of Merger, as provided in _Section 1.5_, (ii) the filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC after the Closing Date covering the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to the First Merger, (iii) any filings as may be required under applicable state securities laws and the securities laws of any foreign country, and (iv) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals, notices and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not be material to Acquirors, Tolo One Subs or Tolo Two Subs ability to consummate the Merger or to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

 3.5 _No Prior Sub Operations_. Each of Tolo One Sub and Tolo Two Sub was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Merger and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 3.6 _No Action_. Acquiror has not taken nor agreed to take any action (other than actions contemplated by this Agreement) that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from constituting a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. Acquiror is not aware (outside of this Agreement) of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from so qualifying.

Additional Agreements 

  

 5.1 _Stockholder Approval and Board Recommendation_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with this Agreement, Delaware Law, its Certificate of Incorporation and its Bylaws to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. The Companys obligation to secure the Company Stockholder Approval in accordance with this  _Section 5.1(a)_ shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to Company of any Acquisition Proposal, including a Superior Proposal, or in the event that the Company Board withholds, withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation to the Company Stockholders in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an executed Company Stockholder Consent from each Company Stockholder not listed in _Exhibit A-1_. 

  

 (b) (i) The Company Board shall unanimously recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stockholder Consent; (ii) any information statement or other disclosure document distributed to the Companys stockholders in connection with this transaction shall include a statement to the effect that the Company Board has unanimously recommended that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stockholder Consent; and (iii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the unanimous recommendation of the Company Board that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to execution of the Company Stockholder Consent by a sufficient number of Company Stockholders to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation to the Company Stockholders if (A) it receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal and reasonably concludes in good faith (following the receipt of advice from an investment bank of national standing (including the investment bank currently retained by the Company as of the Agreement Date)) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated (taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the likelihood of the proposal being financed and the Person making the proposal), and would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and (B) it reasonably concludes in good faith (following the receipt of advice from outside counsel) that modification or withdrawal of its recommendation is required in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under Delaware law ("Superior Proposal"). 

  

 5.2 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Agreement Date until the Closing or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_, the Company will not, nor will it authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, affiliates, stockholders or employees or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them (all of the foregoing collectively being the "Company Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, encourage, facilitate, support or induce the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain or continue any communications (except solely to provide written notice as to the existence of these provisions) or negotiations regarding, or 

   #####

respect to, or take any other action regarding, any inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected

to agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal,

Proposal to the vote of any securityholders of Company. The Company will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to
or on the Agreement Date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. If any
Company Representative, whether in his or her capacity as such or in any
other capacity, takes any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to
this  _Section 5.2_ to cause such Company Representative not to take, then
the Company shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have
breached this _Section 5.2_. 

  

 "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with respect to the Company, any agreement, offer, proposal or bona fide indication of interest (other than this Agreement or any other offer, proposal or indication of interest by Acquiror), or any public announcement of intention to enter into any such agreement or of (or intention to make) any offer, proposal or bona fide indication of interest, relating to, or involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from the Company, or from the stockholders of the Company, by any Person or Group (as hereinafter defined) of more than a 10% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or Group beneficially owning 10% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company; (B) any sale, lease, mortgage, pledge, exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition, or disposition of more than 10% of the assets of the Company in any single transaction or series of related transactions; or (C) any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of the Company, or any extraordinary dividend, whether of cash or other property. 

  

 (b) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) notify Acquiror orally and in writing after receipt by the Company (or, to the knowledge of the Company, by any of the Company Representatives), of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any other notice that any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or for access to any of the properties, books or records of the Company by any Person or Persons other than Acquiror. Such notice shall describe (1) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request, and (2) the identity of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. The Company shall keep Acquiror fully informed of the status and details of, and any modification to, any such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and any correspondence or communications related thereto and shall provide to Acquiror a true, correct and complete copy of such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and any amendments, correspondence and communications related thereto, if it is in writing, or a reasonable written summary thereof, if it is not in writing. The Company shall provide Acquiror with 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (c) In the event that any Person submits to the Company (and does not withdraw) a Superior Proposal or an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after receipt of consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing) is, or would reasonably be expected to be or become, a Superior Proposal, then 

   ##### 

  

  

notwithstanding _Section 5.2(a)_, the Company may, so long as the Company
Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained, (i) enter into discussions
with such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) deliver or make
available to such Person nonpublic information regarding the Company,

comply with each of the following: (1) neither the Company nor any
Company Representative shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth

good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that taking such
action is required in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Company Stockholders under Delaware law, (3) the Company first shall
have provided Acquiror with the written notices required by this _Section
5.2_ and written notice of the Companys intention to take such actions, (4)
the Company first shall have received from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive
with regard to Companys confidential information as the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in  _Section 5.3(a)_), it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement shall not include any provision calling for any
exclusive right to negotiate with such Person or having the purported effect
of restricting it from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement, (5)
the Company first shall have given Acquiror at least 48 hours advance notice
of its intent to take such actions, specifying what actions it intends to
take, and (6) prior to or contemporaneously with delivering or making

delivered information.

The Stockholders Agent hereby agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent as though the Stockholders Agent were a party thereto.

The Company shall promptly inform Acquiror of any material communication between the Company and any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If the Company or any affiliate of the Company receives any formal or informal request for supplemental information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, then the Company shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request. The Company shall direct, in its sole discretion, the making of such response, but shall consider in good faith the views of the Acquiror. 

  

 (b) Acquiror shall promptly execute and file, or join in the execution and filing of, any application, notification or other document that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval or consent of any Governmental Entity, whether foreign, federal, state, local or municipal, which may be reasonably required in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a fully prepaid "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six years from the First Effective Time, (ii) covers only those persons who are currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the Agreement Date and only for matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains coverage terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company (the "Company DandO Tail Policy"). The cost of the Company DandO Tail Policy will be treated as a Company Merger Expense hereunder.

 (d) by Acquiror, if (i) the Company shall have breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein and such breach shall not have been cured within 15 Business Days after receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no such cure period shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be reasonably cured) and if not cured within the timeframe above and at or prior to the Closing, such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied, (ii) the Company shall have breached or be deemed to have breached in any material respect _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.2_, or (iii) there shall have been a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company since the Agreement Date that is still continuing ten Business Days after receipt by the Company of written notice of such Material Adverse Effect; or 

  

 (e) by the Company, if Acquiror shall have breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein and such breach shall not have been cured within 15 Business Days after receipt by Acquiror of written notice of such breach ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no such cure period shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be reasonably cured) 

   ##### 

  

  

and if not cured within the timeframe above and at or prior to the Closing,
such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1_ or  _Section 6.2_ to be satisfied. 

   

 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror, Tolo One Sub, Tolo Two Sub the Company or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Article IX_ (General Provisions) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability in connection with any willful breach of such partys representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. 

  

 7.3 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Legal Requirements, the parties hereto may amend this Agreement by authorized action at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval pursuant to an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto (provided that after such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law required further approval by such stockholders without such further stockholder approval). To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent may cause this Agreement to be amended at any time after the Closing by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent. 

  

 7.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. At any time after the Closing, the Stockholders Agent and Acquiror may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Person contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto or the Stockholders Agent to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Without limiting the generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same or any other provision in this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE VIII

 8.1 _Escrow Fund_. The Total Escrow Shares shall be deposited with, Wells Fargo Corporate Trust (or another institution selected by Acquiror and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit, together with any distributions that may be made thereon, to constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") and to be governed by the provisions set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

Shares, severally indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror and its subsidiaries
and affiliates and their respective officers, directors, agents and employees,
and each person, if any, who controls or may control Acquiror or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates within the meaning of the Securities Act (each of
the foregoing being referred to individually as an "Indemnified Person" and
collectively as "Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Damages
(collectively, "Indemnifiable Damages"), whether or not due to a third-party
claim, directly or indirectly arising out of, resulting from or in connection
with (i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter (including any exhibit or
schedule to the Company Disclosure Letter) to be true and correct as of the
Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date as though such representation or
warranty were made as of the Closing Date (except in the case of
representations and warranties which by their terms speak only as of a
specific date or dates, which representations and warranties shall be true
and correct as of such date), (ii) any failure of any certification,
representation or warranty made by the Company in any certificate (other than
the Company Financial Certificate) delivered to Acquiror pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date such
certificate is delivered to Acquiror, (iii) any breach of or default in
connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter (including any exhibit or
schedule to the Company Disclosure Letter), (iv) any matter set forth on
_Schedule 2.6_ to the Disclosure Letter or that is or would be an exception
to the representations and warranties made on each date in _Section 2.6_
(Litigation), (v) any inaccuracies in the Spreadsheet (including any failure
of an Effective Time Holder to have good and valid title to its Company
securities as set forth in the Spreadsheet) or the Closing Financial
Certificate (that would result in incorrect payments or distributions of
cash, stock or RSUs, incorrect calculation or withholding of Taxes, incorrect
vesting of cash, stock or RSUs or incorrect contributions to, or withdrawals
or releases from, escrow, in each case whether with respect to amount, timing,
or identity of Person involved), (vi) any payments paid with respect to
Dissenting Shares to the extent that such payments, in the aggregate, exceed
the value of the amounts that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to
_Section 1.9(a)_ upon the exchange of such Dissenting Shares, and (vii)
fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by or on behalf of the
Company. Materiality, material adverse effect or knowledge standards or
qualifications in any representation, warranty or covenant shall only be
taken into account in determining whether a breach of or default in
connection with such representation, warranty or covenant (or failure of any
representation or warranty to be true and correct) exists, and shall not be
taken into account in determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages
with respect to such breach, default or failure to be true and correct. 

   

 8.3 _Indemnifiable Damage Threshold; Remedies_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Person may make a claim for any Escrow Shares from the Escrow Fund in respect of any claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to clauses (i)-(ii) of the first sentence of _Section 8.2_ (and that does not involve (x) fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation by the Company or (y) any failure of any of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 2.2_ (Capital Structure) or _Section 2.3(a)_ (Authority) (collectively, the "Special Representations") to be true and correct as aforesaid), unless and until an Officers Certificate (as defined below) describing Indemnifiable Damages in an aggregate amount greater than $200,000 (the "Threshold") has been delivered, in which case the Indemnified Person may make claims for indemnification and may receive assets from the Escrow Fund for all Indemnifiable Damages (including the amount of the Threshold). 

  

 (b) If the Merger is consummated, recovery from the Escrow Fund and Acquirors right of setoff pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Indemnifiable Damages (i.e., money damages and not specific performance or other equitable remedies) arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in clauses (i)-(vii) of the first sentence of _Section 8.2_, except (1) any failure of any of the Special Representations to be true and correct as 

   ##### 

  

  

aforesaid, and (2) the matters listed in clauses (v) and (vii) of the first
sentence of  _Section 8.2_ (the matters set forth in the foregoing clauses
(1)  (2), collectively, the "Special Claims"). In the case of any claim for
indemnification with respect to any Special Claim, each Effective Time Holder
shall be liable for such holders Pro Rata Share of the amount of
any Indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom; _provided_ , _however_ _,_
that such liability shall be limited to such holders Pro Rata Share of the
Total Merger Consideration Value (the "Maximum Liability Cap"); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any claims with respect to any failure of an Effective Time
Holder to have good and valid title to the Company securities held by such
Effective Time Holder as set forth in the Spreadsheet shall be made against
such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund, or directly
against such Effective Time Holder, and such Effective Time Holder shall be
liable for any such claim up to the amount of the Total Merger Consideration
Value received by such Effective Time Holder. 

   

 (c) In the event that Acquiror brings any indemnification claim for Indemnifiable Damages against the Escrow Shares, such indemnification claim will be satisfied as follows: (1) 53.33% of the dollar amount of such claim will be satisfied by Escrow Shares and (2) 46.67% of the dollar amount of such claim will be satisfied by set off against the cash Top-Up Payments (if any) payable to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to _Section 1.9(b)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) in the case of indemnification claims other than Special Claims ("Non-Special Claims"), such Non-Special Claims may only be set off to the extent they were made during the Escrow Period and the maximum set off for such Non-Special Claims shall be $10,239,000 and (ii) in the case of Special Claims, such Special Claims may only be set off to the extent they were made during the applicable Special Claims Period and such set off shall be subject to the Maximum Liability Cap. 

  

 (d) The payment of any Escrow Shares in satisfaction of any indemnification obligations under this _Article VIII_ shall be made, with respect to each Effective Time Holder that holds Unvested Company Shares as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, first with vested Escrow Shares and then, if such vested Escrow Shares are insufficient to satisfy such indemnification obligation and only to the extent of such insufficiency, shall such payment be made with unvested Escrow Shares. 

  

 (e) Indemnifiable Damages shall be calculated net of actual recoveries under existing insurance policies (net of any actual collection costs and reserves, deductibles, premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums as determined in good faith by an Indemnified Person); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be deemed to require or obligate any Indemnified Person to seek or continue to pursue recovery under any insurance policy with respect to any amount of Indemnifiable Damages. 

  

 (f) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of an Effective Time Holder for fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation committed by such Effective Time Holder. 

  

 8.4 _Period for Claims Against Escrow Fund_. Except as set forth below, the period during which claims for Indemnifiable Damages may be made (the "Claims Period") against the Escrow Fund for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with Non-Special Claims shall commence at the Closing and terminate the day after the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period"). The Claims Period for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with Special Claims shall commence at the Closing and terminate upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for such claim (the applicable time period specified in this sentence being the "Special Claims Period"). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, such portion of the Escrow Fund at the conclusion of the Escrow Period as in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Indemnifiable Damages specified in any Officers Certificate (as defined in _Section 8.5_) delivered to the Stockholders Agent prior to expiration of the Escrow Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims for 

   ##### 

  

  

Indemnifiable Damages have been resolved or satisfied. The remainder of the
Escrow Fund, if any, shall be distributed to the Effective Time Holders
promptly (and in any event within ten Business Days) after the expiration of
the Escrow Period. In such event, each Effective Time Holder will be entitled
to receive such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share of the assets in the
Escrow Fund being distributed. The availability of the Escrow Fund to
indemnify the Indemnified Persons will be determined without regard to any
right to indemnification which any Effective Time Holder may have in his or
her capacity as an officer, director, employee, or agent of the Company and no
such Effective Time Holder will be entitled to any indemnification from the
Company or the Surviving Entity for amounts paid for indemnification under
this _Article VIII_. 

   

 8.5 _Claims_. 

  

 (a) On or before the last day of the Escrow Period, Acquiror may deliver to the Escrow Agent, and, following the expiration of the Escrow Period, on or before the last day of the Special Claims Period, Acquiror may deliver to the Stockholders Agent (as such term is defined below), a certificate signed by any officer of Acquiror (an "Officers Certificate"): 

  

 (i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue, Indemnifiable Damages (or that with respect to any Tax matters, that any Tax Authority may reasonably raise such matter in audit of Acquiror or its subsidiaries, which could give rise to Indemnifiable Damages); 

  

 (ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the maximum amount reasonably anticipated by Acquiror to be incurred, paid, reserved, accrued or demanded by a third party); and 

  

 (iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed by Acquiror) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such Indemnifiable Damages are related. 

  

No delay in providing such Officers Certificate within the Claims Period
shall affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless (and then only
to the extent that) the Stockholders Agent or the Effective Time Holders are
materially prejudiced thereby. 

  

 (b) At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officers Certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholders Agent by or on behalf of Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) and for a period of 20 days after such delivery to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholders Agent of such Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no payment pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholders Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such 20-day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of shares from the Escrow Fund with a value equal to the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages to Acquiror in accordance with this _Section 8.5_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such delivery may be made if and to the extent the Stockholders Agent has objected in a written statement to any claim or claims made in the Officers Certificate, and such written statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Acquiror prior to the expiration of such 20-day period. 

  

 (c) Subject to the provisions of _Section 8.3_, if, upon the resolution of any claim for Indemnifiable Damages as provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement, Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) shall be entitled to receive any assets from the Escrow Fund, the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

  

Agent shall deliver to Acquiror out of the Escrow Fund as soon as practicable,
Escrow Shares having aggregate value equal to the amount of such
Indemnifiable Damages, plus the distributions made on such Escrow Shares. 

   

 (d) For the purpose of compensating Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) for any Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to this Agreement, each whole share of Acquiror Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Acquiror Closing Stock Price (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Acquiror Common Stock occurring after the Effective Time). 

  

 8.6 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_. 

  

 (a) If the Stockholders Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by Acquiror made in any Officers Certificate within such 20-day period, Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent shall attempt in good faith for 45 days after Acquirors receipt of such written objection to resolve such objection. If Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such memorandum. 

  

 (b) If no such agreement can be reached during the 45-day period for good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 45-day period, either Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent may bring suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the Federal district court of the United States of America, in each case, located within the City of Wilmington in the State of Delaware to resolve the matter. The decision of the trial court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and the Escrow Agent shall distribute assets from the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 

  

 8.7 _Stockholders  Agent_. 

  

 (a) At the Closing, Mike Kwatinetz shall be constituted and appointed as the Stockholders Agent. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Stockholders Agent" shall mean the agent for and on behalf of the Effective Time Holders to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Acquiror (on behalf of itself of any other Indemnified Person) relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such stockholders individually); (ii) authorize deliveries to Acquiror of assets from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person, including by not objecting to such claims); (iii) object to such claims pursuant to _Section 8.5_; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into, or, if applicable, prosecute or defend settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, such claims; (v) consent or agree to any amendment to this Agreement, and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. The Person serving as the Stockholders Agent may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the assets then on deposit in the Escrow Fund upon not less than ten days prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders Agent, and the Stockholders Agent shall receive no compensation for his services. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable to any former holder of Company Capital Stock or other Effective Time Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholders Agent while acting in good faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Effective Time Holders shall severally indemnify the Stockholders Agent and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably incurred by the Stockholders Agent. If not paid directly to the Stockholders Agent by the Effective Time Holders, such losses, liabilities or expenses may be recovered by the Stockholders Agent from the assets in the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Effective Time Holders (and not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified Person or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person) after the expiration of the Escrow Period pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement, at the time of distribution, and such recovery will be made from the Effective Time Holders, severally and not jointly, according to their respective Pro Rata Shares. 

  

 (c) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholders Agent that is within the scope of the Stockholders Agents authority under  _Section 8.7(a)_ shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Effective Time Holders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Effective Time Holder; and each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such Effective Time Holder. 

  

 8.8 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a third-party claim which Acquiror believes may result in Indemnifiable Damages, Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve any such claim (and the costs and expenses incurred by Acquiror in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution (including reasonable attorneys fees (other than those of in-house legal counsel), other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Indemnifiable Damages for which Acquiror may seek indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder). The Stockholders Agent shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege relating to any Indemnified Person and subject to execution by the Stockholders Agent of Acquirors standard non-disclosure agreement to the extent that such materials contain confidential or proprietary information. However, Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine and conduct the defense of the third-party claim and the settlement, adjustment or compromise of the third-party claim; unless otherwise consented to in writing in advance by Acquiror in its sole discretion, the Stockholders Agent and its affiliates may not participate in the third-party claim or any Action related to the Third Party Claim (including any discussions or negotiations in connection with the settlement, adjustment or compromise thereof). Except with the consent of the Stockholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to have been given unless the Stockholders Agent shall have objected within 15 days after delivery to the Stockholders Agent of a written request for such consent by Acquiror, no settlement or resolution by Acquiror of any claim that gives rise to a claim against the Escrow Fund by or on behalf of an Indemnified Person shall be determinative of the existence of or amount of Indemnifiable Damages relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholders Agent has consented to any such settlement or resolution, or if the Stockholders Agent shall have been determined 

   ##### 

  

  

(pursuant to  _Section 8.6(b)_) to have unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed its consent to any such settlement or resolution, neither the
Stockholders Agent nor any Effective Time Holder shall have any power or
authority to object under _Section 8.5_ or any other provision of this 
_Article VIII_ to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement
or resolution.

 9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

to be conducted by the Company during the six months following the Agreement
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any representation or warranty
contained in _Article II_ containing such a phrase would fail to be true and

Companys business with Acquirors business) made at the direction of
Acquiror following the Closing, then such failure will not be indemnifiable
pursuant to clauses (i)-(ii) of the first sentence of _Section 8.2_.
