Seller included herein an aggregate purchase price equal to $4,768,225
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.2 (the "Purchase
Price").  3.2. Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) Not less than two business
days prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a schedule (the
"Pre-Closing Schedule"), setting forth on an itemized basis (i) all cash
receipts of the Business from and including February 4, 1996 (the
"Effective Date") to and including April 13, 1996 ("Interim
Cash    Receipts"), and all cash disbursements made by Seller from
the Effective Date to and including April 13, 1996 in respect of ordinary
course trade payables and accrued expenses of the Business (which shall not
include any liabilities which are referred to herein as Retained Liabilities)
("Interim Cash Disbursements") and (ii) all overhead expenses allocated to
the Business consistent with Parent\'s historic practice, but not to exceed
$27,878 for any one week period, from the Effective Date to and including
April 13, 1996 ("Interim Overhead Expenses"). The Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the amount of the Interim Cash Receipts and increased by the
amount of the Interim Cash Disbursements and Interim Overhead Expenses as
set forth on the Pre-Closing Schedule.  (b) As soon as practicable, but in
no event later than 30 days after the Closing, Seller will provide to
Purchaser a schedule (the "Post-Closing Schedule"), setting forth on an
itemized basis, with appropriate supporting detail, (i) all cash receipts of
the Business after April 13, 1996 to and including the Closing Date ("Final
Cash Receipts"), and all cash disbursements made by Seller after April 13,
1996 to and including the Closing Date in respect of ordinary course
trade payables and accrued expenses of the Business (which shall not include
any liabilities which are referred to herein as Retained Liabilities) ("Final
Cash Disbursements") and (ii) all overhead expenses allocated to the Business
consistent with Parent\'s historic practice, but not to exceed $27,878 for
any one week period, after April 13, 1996 to and including the Closing Date
("Final Overhead Expenses"). If the amount of the Final Cash Receipts is
greater than the sum of the amount of the Final Cash Disbursements and Final
Overhead Expenses then Parent shall pay to Purchaser, in immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the difference. If the amount of the
Final Cash Receipts is less than the sum of the amount of the Final Cash
Disbursements and Final Overhead Expenses then Purchaser shall pay to Seller,
in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the difference. Payments
pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.  (c) The Post-Closing Schedule shall be
final and binding on the parties unless, within 15 business days after
delivery to Purchaser, notice is given by Purchaser to Seller of
its objection setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such objection. If notice of objection is given, the parties shall consult
with each other with respect to the objection. If the parties are unable to
reach agreement within 15 days after the notice of objection has been given,
the dispute shall be referred for resolution to a mutually acceptable firm
of certified public accountants for resolution, the costs and expenses of
which firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and    Seller. If Purchaser
and Seller cannot mutually agree upon said firm of certified public
accountants within 15 days, the disputed Post-Closing Statement shall be
jointly determined by two firms of certified public accountants, one such
firm being selected by each of Purchaser and Seller, within ten days of the
expiration of said 15-day period, with Purchaser and Seller each paying the
costs and expenses of the firm selected by it. In the event that the
respective firms of certified public accountants of Purchaser and Seller are
unable to so agree within 30 days of the selection of such two firms of
certified public accountants, such firms of certified public
accountants shall select a third firm of certified public accountants (which
shall be one of the six largest nationally recognized public accounting firms
in the United States) within ten days of the expiration of said 30-day period
to determine the Post- Closing Statement pursuant to this Section 3.2 as soon
as practicable after being selected and whose determination shall be final
and binding upon the parties. The costs and expenses of such third firm of
certified public accountants shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.
During the period from the date of delivery of the Post-Closing Statement to
Purchaser through the date of resolution of any dispute regarding the Post-
Closing Statement as contemplated by this Section 3.2, Parent, Seller and
their respective successors will provide Purchaser and its agents and
representatives reasonable access to the books, records, facilities and
employees of Parent and Seller for purposes specifically required for the
review of such Post-Closing Statement and the resolution of any
related dispute.  3.3. Allocation of Purchase Price. Schedule 3.3 hereto
sets forth the agreement of the parties as to a tentative allocation of the
Purchase Price among the Assets (determined as of February 3, 1996)
(including the Assumed Liabilities) (the "Tentative Allocation"). On the
Closing Date, and upon final determination of the Post-Closing Statement, the
parties shall make appropriate adjustments to the Tentative Allocation
and shall update Schedule 3.3 to reflect any changes in the Assets and/or
the liabilities of Seller arising between February 3, 1996 and the Closing
Date (the "Closing Allocation"). Purchaser and Seller agree to notify the
other promptly, as soon as either becomes aware of any circumstances which
may require any such adjustments to the Closing Allocation. Each of Seller
and Purchaser shall prepare and file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Closing Allocation. Purchaser and Seller agree to consult with each
other with respect to all issues related to such Allocation in connection
with any tax audits, controversy or litigation. No party hereto shall
take or agree to any position inconsistent with the Allocation in connection
with any tax audit, controversy or litigation which would adversely affect
the taxes of any other party hereto to    any material extent without the
prior written consent of such other party. Such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and shall not be necessary to the extent the party
which takes or agrees to such inconsistent position has indemnified
the other party against the effects of such action.    ARTICLE IV. THE
CLOSING  4.1. Date of Closing. The consummation of the purchase and sale of
the Assets contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place on May 3,

Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Seller and
Parent enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights in general and
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).  5.1.3.
Intentionally Omitted.  5.1.4. No Restrictions on Seller or Parent; Required
Consents. Except as listed or described on Schedule 5.1.4, the execution and

of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a benefit that relates to the
Business under, any Contract, Permit, order, judgment or decree to which

respect to Seller or Parent in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Seller or Parent or the performance by Seller or Parent of
the transactions contemplated hereby to be performed by either of them,
except for such of the foregoing as are listed or described on Schedule

Subject to the notes attached thereto Schedule 5.1.6(a) reflects true and
complete copies of the unaudited balance sheets of Seller at February 3,
1996, February 4, 1995 and February 5, 1994 and the related
unaudited statements of income for the fiscal years then ended, all
of which, except as set forth on Schedule 5.1.6(b), have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") consistently applied throughout the periods involved. Such balance
sheets, including the related notes to the year-end statements, fairly
present the financial position, assets and liabilities (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) of Seller at the dates indicated
and such statements of income fairly present the results of operations of
Seller for the periods indicated. References in this Agreement to the
"Interim Balance Sheet" shall mean the balance sheet of Seller as of February
3, 1996 referred to above; and references in this Agreement to the "Interim
Balance Sheet Date" shall be deemed to refer to February 3, 1996. The Interim
Balance Sheet specifically identifies the assets and liabilities which, if
the Closing had been held on the Interim Balance Sheet Date, would have
been held by Purchaser subsequent to the Closing.  5.1.7. Accounts

business consistent with past practice, are not to the best knowledge of
Seller subject to valid defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which have not
been reserved for on the Interim Balance Sheet; and are collectible within
120 days of the Closing Date at the full recorded amount thereof less, in
the case of accounts receivable appearing on the Interim Balance Sheet, the
recorded allowance for collection losses on the Interim Balance Sheet. The
allowance for collection losses on the Interim Balance Sheet has been
determined in accordance with GAAP except for such deviations thereto as are
set forth on Schedule 5.1.6(b), consistent with past practice.  5.1.8.
Inventory. All inventory of Seller, including without limitation raw
materials, work-in process and finished goods, reflected on the Interim
Balance Sheet or acquired since the date thereof was acquired and has been
maintained in the    ordinary course of the Business; is of good and
merchantable quality; consists substantially of a quality, quantity
and condition usable, leasable or saleable in the ordinary course of the
Business; is valued at market; and is not subject to any write-down or write-
off. Seller is not under any liability or obligation with respect to the
return of inventory in the possession of wholesalers, retailers or other
customers.   5.1.9. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Seller has
no material liabilities or obligations, either direct or indirect, matured
or unmatured or absolute, contingent or otherwise, except:  (a) those
liabilities or obligations set forth on the Interim Balance Sheet and not
heretofore paid or discharged;  (b) liabilities arising in the ordinary
course of business under any agreement, contract, commitment, lease or plan
specifically disclosed on Schedule 5.1.11; and  (c) those liabilities or

Balance Sheet Date.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "liabilities"
shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect indebtedness,
guaranty, endorsement, claim, loss, damage, deficiency, cost, expense,
obligation or responsibility, whether fixed or contingent, known or unknown,
asserted or unasserted, choate or inchoate, liquidated or
unliquidated, secured or unsecured.  5.1.10. Books of Account. The books,
records and accounts of Seller accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable
detail, the transactions and the assets and liabilities of Seller
relating to the Business. Seller has not, in connection with the operation
of the Business, engaged in any transaction, maintained any bank account or
used any of the funds of Seller except for transactions, bank accounts and
funds which have been and are reflected in the normally maintained books
and records of the Business.  5.1.11. Contracts. (a) Except as described on
Schedule 5.1.11, the Seller is not a party to any written or oral:  (i)

supplies or products, or for the performance of services by a third party

Business is valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms; Seller is,
and to the best of Seller\'s or Parent\'s knowledge all other
parties thereto are, in compliance in all material respects with
the provisions thereof; Seller is not, and to the best of Seller\'s or
Parent\'s knowledge no other party thereto is, in material default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any    obligation, covenant or
condition contained therein; and no event has occurred which with or without
the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default thereunder. Except as listed on Schedule 5.1.11, no written or oral
agreement, contract or commitment described or required to be described on
Schedule 5.1.11 requires the consent of any party to its assignment in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.  5.1.12. Title to
Assets. Except as listed or described on Schedule 5.1.12, Seller has, and
following the Closing, Purchaser will have, good, valid and marketable title

deposited by Seller with the landlord or sublandlord, if any, the
monthly rental (including base and all additional rents), and
whether consent is required pursuant to such Real Property Lease for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.  (b) All Real Property
Leases are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms,
neither Seller nor, to the best knowledge of Seller and Parent, any other
party to any such lease is in default thereunder, and no event of default
or other event that, with the giving of notice and/or the passage of time,
would constitute an event of default has occurred thereunder with respect to
Seller or, to the knowledge of Seller or Parent, any other party thereto. To
the knowledge of Seller or Parent, the Leased Real Property has legal access
to adjacent public streets and roads and no conditions exist which could
result in the termination of such legal access. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.1.16(b), to the knowledge of Seller or Parent, all improvements
located on the Leased Real Property are in good condition and are
structurally sound, and all mechanical and other systems located therein are
in good operating condition, subject to normal wear. To the knowledge of
Seller or Parent, the Leased Real Property is properly zoned for its present
use under applicable zoning ordinances, and there are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Seller or Parent, threatened actions or proceedings which could
result in a modification or termination of such zoning. Except as set forth
on Schedule 5.1.16(b), Seller has not received notice that any of the Leased
Real Property is subject to any governmental decree or order to be sold or is
being condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any public authority with
or without payment of compensation therefor, nor, to the best knowledge of
Seller or Parent, has any such condemnation, expropriation or taking been
proposed.  5.1.17. Insurance. To the knowledge of Seller or Parent, Seller
has insurance policies in full force and effect for such amounts as are
sufficient for material compliance with all agreements to which Seller is a
party or by which it is bound. Set forth in Schedule 5.1.17 is a list of all
fire, liability    and other forms of insurance and all fidelity bonds
held by or applicable to Seller or the Business, setting forth, in
respect of each such policy, the policy name, policy number, carrier, term,
type of coverage and annual premium. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.1.17,
no event relating to Seller or the Business has occurred which can reasonably
be expected to result in a retroactive upward adjustment in premiums under
any such insurance policies or which is likely to result in a prospective
upward adjustment in such premiums. Excluding insurance policies that have
expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of business, no insurance
policy has been cancelled within the last two years and, to Seller\'s
or Parent\'s knowledge, no threat has been made to cancel any insurance
policy of Seller during such period. Except as noted on Schedule 5.1.17, all
such insurance will remain in full force and effect with respect to periods
before the Closing. No event has occurred, including, without limitation,
the failure by Seller to give any notice or information or Seller giving any
inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which limits or impairs the
rights of Seller under any such insurance policies.  5.1.18. Conduct of the

of the information contained in its representations and warranties made in
Article V hereof or any Exhibits or Schedules referred to herein or attached

any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1.1(a) hereof or the compliance by Seller or Parent with
the covenant set forth in Section 6.1 hereof; provided, however, that
by consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser waives any
right or claim it may other wise have or have had on account of any event

warranty under this Agreement inaccurate, so long as Seller has disclosed
such event or fact to Purchaser in writing promptly after the Seller becomes

transactions contemplated hereby.  6.8. Injunctions. Without limiting the
generality or effect of any provision of Section 6.9 or Article VII, if any
United States, state or foreign court having jurisdiction over any party
issues or otherwise promulgates any injunction, decree or similar order prior
to the Closing which prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the parties will use their respective reasonable efforts
to have such injunction dissolved or otherwise eliminated as promptly as
possible and, prior to or after the Closing, to pursue the underlying
litigation diligently and in good faith.  6.9. Filings. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, each party shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain, and to cooperate with the other party in
obtaining, all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of
any Governmental Entity that may be or become necessary in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
take all reasonable actions to avoid the entry of any order or decree by

notifications to be filed by the other.  6.10. Publicity. Prior to the
Closing, no party hereto will issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other
party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
that nothing herein will prohibit either party from issuing or causing
publication of any such press release or public announcement to the extent
that such party determines such action to be required by Law or the rules of
any national stock exchange applicable to it or its Affiliates, in which
event the party making such determination will, if practicable in the
circumstances, use reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of its
issuance.  6.11. Acquisition Proposals. From and after the date of
this Agreement, Seller and Parent shall not, nor shall they authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of, or    any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by, Seller or Parent
to, solicit, initiate or encourage submission of any proposal or
offer (including by way of furnishing information) from any person which
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal. As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
proposal for a merger or other business combination involving Seller or any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner a substantial portion of
the assets of Seller used or useful in the Business.  6.12. Books and
Records. On the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Purchaser all books and
records of Seller used or useful in the Business and described in Section

Contracts, Etc. (a) Schedule 6.15 sets forth a list of certain Contracts
("Master Contracts"), including without limitation vehicle leases and other
agreements relating to the Business under which Seller has any liability.
From and after the Closing, Seller will use its best efforts to obtain and
have issued replacements for each such Master Contract and to obtain any
amendments, novations, releases, waivers, consents or approvals necessary to
release Seller from all liability thereunder arising after the Closing Date,
in each case as promptly as practicable.  (b) Without limiting the
generality or effect of Section 6.15(a), following the Closing, Seller will
assist Purchaser to negotiate with the lessor under each vehicle lease
described on Schedule 6.15 (the "Vehicle Leases") a new lease,
with Purchaser as lessee. If Purchaser is unable to negotiate new leases of
such vehicles on terms acceptable to Purchaser, Purchaser may, at its option,
require Seller to exercise Seller\'s rights under the Vehicle Leases to
direct the leasing company to sell such vehicles and transfer them to
Purchaser at a price not to exceed $7,100. Until arrangements have been made
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.15(b), Seller will
give Purchaser the full use of such vehicles at the cost and expense of
Purchaser.       ARTICLE VII. CONDITIONS TO CLOSING  7.1. Conditions

unwritten, heretofore sponsored or maintained by Seller (and no amount
attributable to any such plan, fund, program or arrangement) shall be
transferred to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall not be required to continue any
such plan, fund, program or arrangement after the Closing Date. The amounts

or Schedule 5.1.21(a) (other than as specified in the following subsections)
shall be determined with reference to the date of the event by reason of
which such amounts become payable, without regard to conditions subsequent,
and Purchaser shall not be liable for any claim for insurance,
reimbursement or other benefits payable by reason of any event which
occurs prior to the Closing Date. All amounts payable directly to employees,
or to any fund, program, arrangement or plan maintained by Seller therefor
shall be paid by Seller within 30    days after the Closing Date to the
extent that such payment is not inconsistent with the terms of such fund,

after the Closing Date to any employee of Seller listed on Schedule 9.1(b)
who was actively employed in the Business on the last day of business
immediately preceding the Closing Date or who was temporarily absent on the
last day of business immediately preceding the Closing Date from active
employment in the Business and has rights of re-employment upon termination
of such employee\'s temporary absence; provided, however, that the Purchaser
shall not be obligated to employ any of such employees of Seller if the
Closing does not occur. Each offer of employment to any Business employee
shall be on terms and conditions substantially similar to the terms and
conditions of each such employee\'s employment with Seller as of the
Closing Date as determined by the Purchaser in its sole
discretion; provided, however, that Purchaser shall offer each employee
of Seller base wages at least equal to the base wages paid by Seller to such
employee as of the Closing Date. Each employee who accepts the offer of
employment shall be deemed to be an employee of the Purchaser ("Transferred
Employee") on the day he commences active employment with the Purchaser (not
earlier than the Closing Date). Purchaser acknowledges that it shall assume
the accrued payroll and ordinary payroll related liabilities and accrued
vacation and sick leave calculated as of the Closing Date of those employees
of Seller who accept employment with Purchaser. Seller acknowledges that it
shall be responsible for the payment of all accrued employee benefits and
other compensation payable to its employees through the Closing Date not

vacation and severance costs payable to any employee of Seller not accepting

Transferred Employees at any time, with or without cause, and to change the
terms and conditions of employment of any or all Transferred Employees. For
purposes of this Section 9.1, an individual shall be deemed temporarily
absent from active employment on the Closing Date if such individual
is absent from work for any reason (including disability, illness, injury,
worker\'s compensation, leave of absence or layoff) other than by reason of
vacation, in which case the employee is considered to be an active
employee.  (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary (i) Seller shall be liable for and shall pay all benefits and
severance payments, if any, for those employees    listed on Schedule
9.1(c) and Purchaser shall have no obligation to offer employment to such
employees, and (ii) Seller and Purchaser shall each pay one-half of any
severance payments to those employees listed on Schedule 9.1(d)
and Purchaser shall have no obligation to offer employment to
such employees.  9.2. Severance and Non-Solicitation. (a) Seller
shall terminate effective as of the Closing Date all employment arrangements
it has with any of the Employees who are to be offered employment by
Purchaser. Seller shall be responsible for any severance or similar
obligations arising from the transaction contemplated hereby for those
Employees of Seller (i) terminated pursuant to this Section 9.2 and
offered employment by Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(b) but who do not
accept such employment and (ii) terminated pursuant to this Section 9.2, and
classified as "home office" employees and were not offered employment by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(b). Purchaser shall be responsible for any
severance or similar obligation arising from the transaction contemplated
hereby for those Employees of Seller who are classified as "field employees"
who were terminated pursuant to this Section 9.2 and not offered employment
by Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(b).  (b) Until the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller and Parent covenant and agree that they will not,
and that they will cause each of their respective affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly solicit or offer employment to or employ any employee
of Purchaser (i) who was an Employee to whom Purchaser offered employment but
who did not become an employee of Purchaser, or (ii) who is then an employee
of Purchaser.  (c) Until the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser covenants and agrees it will not directly or indirectly solicit or
offer employment to or employ any employee of Seller or of any affiliate of
Seller listed on Schedule 9.2(c) who is then an employee of Seller or of any
such scheduled affiliate.  9.3. Discharge of Business Obligations. From and
after the Closing Date, Seller shall pay and discharge, in accordance with
past practice but not less than on a timely basis, all obligations and
liabilities incurred prior to the Closing Date in respect of the Business,
its operations or the assets and properties used therein (except for those
expressly assumed by Purchaser hereunder), including without limitation
any liabilities or obligations to employees, trade creditors and clients of
the Business.  9.4. Maintenance of Books and Records. Each of Parent,
Seller and Purchaser shall preserve in accordance with their respective
retention policies in effect on the Closing Date all    records possessed
or to be possessed by such party relating to any of the assets, liabilities
or business of the Business prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing
Date, where there is a legitimate purpose, such party shall provide the
other parties with access, upon prior reasonable written request specifying
the need therefor, during regular business hours, to (i) the officers and
employees of such party and (ii) the books of account and records of such
party, but, in each case, only to the extent relating to the assets,
liabilities or business of the Business prior to the Closing Date, and the
other parties and their representatives shall have the right to make copies
of such books and records; provided, however, that the foregoing right of
access shall not be exercisable in such a manner as to interfere unreasonably
with the normal operations and business of such party; and further, provided,
that, as to so much of such information as constitutes trade secrets
or confidential business information of such party, the requesting party and
its officers, directors and representatives will use due care to not disclose
such information except (i) as required by law, (ii) with the prior written
consent of such party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
or (iii) where such information becomes available to the public generally,
or becomes generally known to competitors of such party, through sources
other than the requesting party, its affiliates or its officers, directors or
representatives. Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by a party if
such party sends to the other parties written notice of its intent
to destroy records, specifying with particularity the contents of the
records to be destroyed. Such records may then be destroyed after the 30th
day after such notice is given unless another party objects to the
destruction, in which case the party seeking to destroy the records shall
either agree to retain such records or deliver such records to the
objecting party.  9.5. Payments Received. Parent, Seller and Purchaser each
agree that after the Closing they will hold and will promptly transfer and
deliver to the other, from time to time as and when received by them, any
cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using their best efforts not to
convert such checks into cash), or other property that they may receive
on or after the Closing which properly belongs to the other party, including
without limitation any insurance proceeds, and will account to the other for
all such receipts. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall have the right
and authority to endorse without recourse the name of Seller on any check or
any other evidences of indebtedness received by Purchaser on account of the
Business and the Assets transferred to Purchaser hereunder.  9.6.
[Intentionally Omitted].     9.7. UCC Matters. From and after the Closing
Date, Seller will promptly refer all inquiries with respect to ownership of
the Assets or the Business to Purchaser. In addition, Seller will execute
such documents and financing statements as Purchaser may request from time to
time to evidence transfer of the Assets to Purchaser, including any necessary
assignments of financing statements.  9.8. Covenant Not to Compete. (a)
Seller and Parent agree that for a period of three years after the Closing
Date, neither it nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly,
own, manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, that is engaged in producing or securing
the production of high speed copying of text documents.
Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and Parent are engaged in other imaging
businesses, including portrait studios and photofinishing, and in research
and development activities involving color digital imaging. Purchaser
further acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the right
of Seller, Parent or their Affiliates to continue or to expand their (i)
current imaging operations; (ii) research and development activities; or
(iii) pursuit of new lines of business or technologies; provided that they do
not engage in the business of producing or securing the production of
high speed copying of text documents. Purchaser agrees that Seller\'s
continued operation of its Imageland/Image Explosion store in Chicago,
Illinois, in the manner operated as of the date hereof will not violate the
provisions of this covenant.  (b) The parties hereto specifically
acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing
will be inadequate and that the Purchaser, in addition to any other relief
available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive
relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond
whatsoever. In the event that the provisions of this Section 9.8 should ever
be deemed to exceed the limitation provided by applicable law, then
the parties hereto agree that such provisions shall be reformed to set forth
the maximum limitations permitted.  9.9. Post-Closing Notifications.
Purchaser, Parent and Seller will, and each will cause their respective
Affiliates to, comply with any post-Closing notification or
other requirements, to the extent then applicable to such party, of any
antitrust, trade competition, investment or control, export or other Law of
any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over Purchaser, Parent or
Seller.      9.10. Certain Tax Matters. All sales, use, transfer,
stamp, conveyance, value added or other similar taxes, duties, excises or
governmental charges imposed by any taxing jurisdiction, domestic or foreign,
and all recording or filing fees, notarial fees and other similar costs of
Closing with respect to the transfer of the Assets or otherwise on account of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be borne by
Seller.  9.11. Insurance. With respect to any loss, liability or
damage relating to, resulting from or arising out of the conduct of the
Business on or prior to the Closing Date for which Seller would be entitled
to assert, or cause any Affiliate or other person or entity to assert, a
claim for recovery under any policy of insurance maintained by or for the
benefit of Seller or any Affiliate thereof in respect of the Business or
the Assets, at the request of Purchaser, Seller will use reasonable efforts
to assert, or to assist Purchaser to assert, one or more claims under such
insurance covering such loss, liability or damage if Purchaser is not itself
entitled to assert such claim but Seller is so entitled.    ARTICLE X.

$100,000.  (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of
any applicable Law, no Seller Indemnitee entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement will be entitled to make a claim in respect of any breach of a
representation or warranty under Section 10.3(b)(i) hereof unless and until
the aggregate amount of all claims by all Seller Indemnitees in respect
of breaches of representations and warranties asserted for Indemnifiable
Losses under Section 10.3(b)(i) hereof exceeds $100,000, in which event the
Seller Indemnitees will be entitled to indemnification to the extent of such
Indemnifiable Losses claimed under this Agreement with respect to breaches
of representations and warranties exceed $100,000.      10.3.
Indemnification. (a) Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.2, from and after the
Closing, Seller and Parent agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, partners, employees, agents and representatives from
and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent relating to,
resulting from or arising out of:  (i)any breach of representation or
warranty of Seller or Parent under the terms of this Agreement or in any
Closing Documents;  (ii)any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or
covenant of Seller or Parent under the terms of this Agreement;  (iii)any
Excluded Asset;  (iv)any Retained Liabilities; and  (v)the conduct of the
Business or any portion thereof or the use or ownership of any of the Assets
on or prior to the Closing Date except for Assumed Liabilities.  (b)
Subject to Sections 10.1 and 10.2, from and after the Closing, Purchaser
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, partners, employees, agents
or representatives from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the
extent relating to, resulting from or arising out of:  (i)any breach of
representation or warranty of Purchaser under the terms of this Agreement or
in any Closing Document;  (ii)any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement
or covenant of Purchaser under the terms of this Agreement;  (iii)any
Assumed Liabilities; and  (iv)the conduct of the Business or any portion
thereof or use or ownership of any of the Assets after the Closing Date
except for Retained Liabilities.  10.4. Defense of Claims. (a) If any
Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any Third Party
Claim against such Indemnitee with respect to which an Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee
will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof,
but in any event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice
of      such Third Party Claim. Such notice (the "Third Party
Claim Notice") will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,
will include copies of all material written evidence thereof and will
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the
Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 14 days from its receipt of a Third Party Claim
Notice (the "Third Party Claim Notice Period") to notify Indemnitee
(i) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the Indemnitee\'s right of
indemnification with respect to such Third Party Claim, and (ii) if the
Indemnifying Party does not dispute such right of indemnification, whether or
not it desires to defend the Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim.  (b
If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnitee within the Third Party
Claim Notice Period that (i) the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the
Indemnitee\'s right of indemnification and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
desires to defend against such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to assume and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim by appropriate proceedings with counsel reasonably acceptable to
Indemnitee at the Indemnifying Party\'s sole cost and expense. The Indemnitee
may participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement at its
sole cost and expense.  (c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) disputes the
Indemnitee\'s right of indemnification with respect to a Third Party
Claim, (ii) does not dispute such right of indemnification but fails to
promptly assume and prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, (iii)
does not dispute such right of indemnification but a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee or (iv)
is not entitled to assume defense of such Third Party Claim under Section
10.4(b), then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim for any reason, it may still participate in, but not
control, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party\'s
sole cost and expense.  (d) The party responsible for the defense of any
Third Party Claim (the "Responsible Party") shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, keep such other party informed
as to the status of any Third Party Claim for which such party is not the
Responsible Party, including, without limitation, all settlement negotiations
and offers. With respect to a Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifying
Party is the Responsible Party, the Indemnitee shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party and its representatives all books and records of
the    Indemnitees relating to such Third Party Claim and shall render to
the Indemnifying Party such assistance and access to records and the
representatives of the Indemnitee as the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives may reasonably request, except that the Indemnitee shall not
be required to make available to the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives any books, records, documents or other information that the
Indemnitee reasonably determines to be confidential or subject to attorney-
client privilege unless and until the Indemnifying Party shall have entered
into such agreements as the Indemnitee reasonably deems to be necessary in
light of all surrounding circumstances (including, without limitation, the
Indemnifying Party\'s need for information in connection with
the investigation or defense of a Third Party Claim) to protect such
confidentiality or privilege.  (e) Neither the Indemnifying Party, on the
one hand, nor the Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall enter into any
settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Responsible Party shall promptly notify the other party of each settlement
offer (including whether or not the Responsible Party is willing to accept
the proposed settlement offer) with respect to a Third Party Claim.
Such other party agrees to notify the Responsible Party with reasonable
promptness whether or not such party is willing to accept the proposed
settlement offer. If an Indemnitee fails to consent to any settlement offer
of a Third Party Claim (whether or not the Indemnitee is the Responsible
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim), the Indemnitee may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim (including the reasonable costs and expenses of contesting or defending
such Third Party Claim incurred after the Indemnitee fails to consent to
such settlement offer) shall not exceed the full amount of such settlement
offer. If the Indemnifying Party fails to consent to any settlement offer of
a Third Party Claim (whether or not the Indemnifying Party is the Responsible
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnitee for the amount of the
Indemnification Loss ultimately recovered against Indemnitee as a result of
such Third Party Claim.  (f) A failure to give timely notice or to include
any specified information in any notice as provided in Sections 10.4(a)
or 10.4(b) will not affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder
except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any party
which was entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to
recover any payment under    its applicable insurance coverage or was
otherwise damaged as a result of such failure.  (g) The Indemnifying Party
will have a period of 30 calendar days within which to respond in writing to
any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss which does
not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"). If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such 30 calendar day period, the
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event
the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnitee on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Article
X.  (h) Any indemnification payment hereunder shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price.    ARTICLE XI. TERMINATION  11.1.
Termination. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing,
if the party seeking to terminate is not then in material default or breach
of this Agreement:  (a) By the mutual written consent of Purchaser and
Parent;  (b) By either Purchaser or Parent if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before June 30, 1996; provided that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose delay or failure to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before such date;  (c) By either Purchaser or Parent
if there shall have been entered a final, nonappealable order or injunction
of any Governmental Entity restraining or prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any material part thereof; or  (d)
By either Purchaser or Parent if, prior to the Closing Date, the other party
is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
herein contained and such breach shall not be cured within fifteen (15) days
of the date of notice of default served by the party claiming such
material default, provided that such terminating party shall not also be in
material breach of this Agreement at the time notice of termination is
delivered.      provided, however, that in no event shall termination of
this Agreement relieve any party of any liability for breaches of this
Agreement prior to the date of termination.    ARTICLE XII. MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS  12.1. Specific Performance. The parties recognize that
if Seller refuses to perform under the provisions of this Agreement,
monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Purchaser for its
injury. Purchaser shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other
remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms
of this Agreement. If any action is brought by Purchaser to enforce this
Agreement, Seller shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at
law.  12.2. Notices. All notices and other communications required or
permitted hereunder will be in writing and, unless otherwise provided in this
Agreement, will be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person or
when dispatched by electronic facsimile transfer or one business day after
having been dispatched by a nationally recognized overnight courier
service to the appropriate party at the address specified below:  (a) If to

otherwise expressly provided herein, Seller will pay any expenses incurred by
it incident to this Agreement and in preparing to consummate and
consummating the transactions provided for herein. Purchaser will pay
any expenses incurred by it incident to this Agreement and in preparing to
consummate and consummating the transactions provided for herein.  12.5.
Successors and Assigns. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, but will not be assignable or delegable by any party without the
prior written consent of the other party which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that (a) nothing in this
Agreement is intended to limit Purchaser\'s ability to sell or to
transfer any or all of the Assets following the Closing Date, (b)
upon notice to Parent and Seller, Purchaser may assign or delegate any or
all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate
thereof or to any person or entity that acquires all or substantially all of
the assets or voting stock of Purchaser, and (c) Purchaser may make a
collateral assignment of its rights under this Agreement to any institutional
lender who provides funds to Purchaser for the acquisition of the Assets;
provided, however, that no assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder. Parent and Seller agree to execute acknowledgements of
such assignment(s) and collateral assignments in such forms as Purchaser
or Purchaser\'s institutional lender(s) may from time to time reasonably
request. In the event of such a proposed assignment by Purchaser, the
provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon Purchaser\'s assigns.  12.6. Waiver. Purchaser, Parent and Seller by
written notice to the other may (a) extend the time for performance of any
of the obligations of the other under this Agreement, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of the other contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered in connection herewith, (c) waive
compliance with any of the    conditions or covenants of the other
contained in this Agreement, or (d) waive or modify performance of any of
the obligations of the other under this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such party may, without the prior written consent of the other party, make
or grant such extension of time, waiver of inaccuracies or compliance or
waiver or modification of performance with respect to its (or any of
its Affiliates) representations, warranties, conditions or covenants
hereunder. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no
action taken pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a waiver
of compliance with any representations, warranties, conditions or covenants
contained in this Agreement and will not operate or be construed as a waiver
of any subsequent breach, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature.  12.7.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto) supersedes
any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been made or
entered into by any party or any of their respective Affiliates (or by
any director, officer or representative thereof) relating to the matters
contemplated hereby. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto) constitutes the entire agreement by and among the parties hereto and
there are no agreements or commitments by or among such parties or their
Affiliates except as expressly set forth herein.  12.8. Amendments and
Supplements. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time by
additional written agreements signed by the parties hereto.  12.9. Rights
of the Parties. Except as provided in Article X or in Section 12.4, nothing
expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or will be construed to
confer upon or give any person or entity other than the parties hereto
and their respective Affiliates any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.  12.10. Brokers.
Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Parent, and
Seller and Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser,
against any liability, claim, loss, damage or expense incurred by
Purchaser or by Seller and Parent, respectively, relating to any fees
or commissions owed to any broker, finder, or financial advisor as a result
of actions taken by Purchaser or by Seller and
Parent, respectively.  12.11. Further Assurances. From time to time, as and
when requested by either party, the other party will execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such    documents and instruments
as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.  12.12. Transfers. Purchaser, Seller and Parent will
cooperate and take such action as may be reasonably requested by the other
in order to effect an orderly transfer of the Assets and the Business with a
minimum of disruption to the operations and employees of the businesses of
Purchaser, Seller and Parent.  12.13. Bulk Sales. Purchaser waives
compliance by Seller with the provisions of the so-called bulk sales Law of
any jurisdiction; provided, however, that Seller will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates in respect of any Indemnifiable
Loss relating to, resulting from or arising out of Seller\'s failure so to
comply with such Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.  12.14. Governing Law. This Agreement, including
without limitation, the interpretation, construction and validity hereof,
shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Missouri.  12.15.

this Agreement shall be deemed or held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law, this Agreement shall
be construed with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision deleted,
and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby.  12.16.
Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same agreement.  12.17. Titles and
Headings. Titles and headings to sections herein are inserted for convenience
of reference only, and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  12.18. Passage of Title and
Risk of Loss. Legal title, equitable title and risk of loss with respect to
the Assets will not pass to Purchaser until such Assets are transferred
at the Closing, which transfer, once it has occurred, will be deemed
effective for tax, accounting and other computational purposes as of 11:59
P.M. (Central Time) on the Closing Date.  12.19. Certain Interpretive

inconsistent with any prior draft hereof or thereof.  12.20. No Recourse.
Notwithstanding any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, Parent and

Purchaser, on the one hand, or Parent and Seller or any stockholder of Parent
on the other hand, in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.  12.21. Schedules and Exhibits. This
Agreement provides for the delivery of a number of schedules and
exhibits (respectively, the "Schedules" and the "Exhibits") identified by
various numbers and letters throughout this Agreement. The Schedules and
Exhibits are to be negotiated by the parties hereto in good faith. Should the
parties hereto fail to reach an agreement on the Schedules and Exhibits by

"Agreement"), dated May 3, 1996, is entered into between Consumer

the "Service Provider"), and Copy USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   W I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, the Company desires to
retain Service Provider to provide certain services to the Company, and
Service Provider desires to provide such services to the Company:   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:   1.
Services. The Company hereby retains the Service Provider to the Company,
through the Service Provider\'s own personnel, those services listed on
Exhibit A hereto (individually, a "Service", and together, the "Services").
The Services may be rendered at the Service Provider\'s offices or at such
other locations selected by the Service Provider as the Company and the
Service Provider shall from time to time agree.   2. Agreement Term.
Termination of Services. (a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the
date hereof and shall continue for a period of 60 days following the
date hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall have the option to
extend such 60 day period for an additional 60 days by giving the Service
Provider written notice of its election to extend not less than 5 days prior
to the expiration of the initial 60 day period (such term, including any
extension thereof, is hereinafter referred to as the
"Transition Period").   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a),
the Company may, at any time during the Transition Period, cancel any
Service by 10 days written notice to the Service Provider. Upon expiration of
such 10 days, the Services Fee (as hereinafter defined) shall, without any
further action by the parties hereto, be reduced by the amount of the weekly
fees relating to the terminated Service as set forth on Exhibit A.   3.
Payment for Services. In consideration of the Service Provider providing the
Services to the Company during the Transition Period, the Company will pay
the Service Provider 15 days following receipt of a weekly invoice
in accordance with Exhibit A. The invoice will set forth the  number of
weeks that service was provided and the total payment per week using the
applicable rates as set forth on Exhibit A with respect to each of the
Services (the "Services Fee").   4. Indemnification. The Company will, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold
harmless the Service Provider, its affiliates and associates, and each of
the respective owners, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents of
each of the foregoing, from and against any loss, liability, damage, claim or
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel) arising as a result or
in connection with the provision of the Services by the Service Provider
hereunder or other activities on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries,
other than acts or omissions of the Service Provider which constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct.   5. Defense of Claims. (a) Service
Provider agrees that during the Transition Period and for a reasonable
period thereafter, Service Provider will cooperate with the Company, at the
Company\'s request and expense, in the defense of any claims that may be made
against the Company or its subsidiaries, to the extent that such claims may
relate to the Services performed by Service Provider for the Company
during the Transition Period. The Service Provider agrees to promptly inform
the Company if it becomes aware of any lawsuits involving such claims that
may be filed against the Company. The Company agrees to reimburse Service
Provider for all of Service Provider\'s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
associated with such cooperation, including travel expenses. During
the Transition Period, the time devoted to such cooperation shall be treated
as time spent rendering the Services. For periods following the Transition
Period, the Company agrees to provide reasonable compensation to Service
Provider for such cooperation.   (b) The Company agrees that during the
Transition Period and for a reasonable period thereafter, the Company
will cooperate with the Service Provider, at the Service Provider\'s request
and expense, in defense of any claims that may be made against the Service
Provider or its subsidiaries, to the extent that such claims may relate to
the Services performed by the Service Provider for the Company during the

Company\'s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with such
cooperation, including travel expenses and to provide reasonable compensation
for such cooperation.      6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets
forth the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the
Service Provider\'s rendering of the Services to the Company. This Agreement
may only be modified, waived or amended expressly by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto.    7. Nonalienation. The Services are hereby
deemed personal in nature and as such the Agreement may not be assigned by
either party except to a parent (or a subsidiary of such parent) or a
subsidiary. Any permitted assignment of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.   8. Severability. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement shall be held to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, the
remaining provisions of this Agreement and the remaining portion of any
provision held void or unenforceable in part shall continue in full force and
effect.   9. Notice. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
notice given hereunder shall be deemed sufficient if delivered personally or
sent by registered or certified mail to the address of the party for whom
intended at the principal executive offices of such party, or at such other
address as such party may hereinafter specify by written notice to the other
party.   10. Waiver of Breach. No waiver by any party of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver
of any preceding or succeeding breach of such provision or of any other
provision herein contained. The failure of any party hereto to take any
action by reason of such breach will not deprive such party of the right to
take action at any time while such breach continues.   11. Independent
Contractor. The Company and Service Provider acknowledge the relationship
created by this Agreement is that of an independent contractor. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed to create a relationship of employer
and employee between the Company and Service Provider or any of Service
Provider\'s employees:   a. Service Provider shall have the sole
discretion to determine the manner and means by which its employees
shall perform their duties, the hours of work of any of its employees and,

are to be performed.   b. Service Provider shall be solely responsible
for all wages, salaries and benefits of its employees, for
all    employment and employment-related taxes and for insurance coverage
required for such employees by law (e.g. workers\' compensation insurance,
disability insurance, unemployment insurance, etc.).   c. Neither Service
Provider nor any of its employees will be entitled to any benefits provided
by the Company to its employees (e.g. group insurance, pension, etc.).   
d. Service Provider agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state,
county and local laws, ordinances, regulations and codes in the performance
of its duties under this Agreement, including laws and executive orders
relating to equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination
in employment.   12. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by

this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby.   14. Survival. Sections 4
through 12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.   15.

each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute a single instrument.       [THE REMAINDER OF THE PAGE
