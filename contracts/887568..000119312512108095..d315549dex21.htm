ARTICLE 2

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

Section 2.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) (i) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.01_, as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent and HoldCo shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) the
Offer at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent and
HoldCo to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in
_Exhibit A_  (each, an "Offer Condition", and together, the "Offer
Conditions"). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th
Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using
Exchange Act Rule 14d-1(g)(3)).

 



10  Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer
or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) reduce the number of Shares
subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the Offer Price, (C) waive or amend the
Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ ), (D) add to the Offer
Conditions, (E) modify any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the holders
of Shares, (F) extend the Offer (except as required or permitted by the other
provisions of this _Section 2.01_), (G) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer or (H) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse
to the holders of Shares.

(ii) Merger Sub shall (and Parent and HoldCo shall cause Merger Sub to):

(A) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer; and

(B) if, on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the
Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive
increments of up to ten Business Days each (or such longer period as the
parties hereto may agree), until such time as all Offer Conditions are
satisfied;

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (1) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the End Date or the termination of this Agreement and (2) if,
at any expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions except for the
Minimum Tender Condition are satisfied or have been waived, Merger Sub shall
only be required to extend the Offer for one or more additional periods not to
exceed an aggregate of twenty (20) Business Days.

 

(iii) If the Offer is completed but fewer than ninety percent (90%) of the
then total outstanding Shares are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer,
then Merger Sub may, and at the request of the Company shall, and upon any
such request of the Company, Parent and HoldCo shall cause Merger Sub to, make
available a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Exchange Act Rule
14d-11.

(iv) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent and HoldCo shall cause Merger Sub to,
promptly after the expiration of the Offer, accept for payment and promptly
thereafter pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer. Parent and HoldCo shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger
Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(v) Nothing contained in this _Section 2.01(a)_ shall affect any termination
rights in Article 8. Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer
without the prior written consent of the Company other than as permitted by
this Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article
8 prior to any scheduled expiration of the Offer, Parent and HoldCo shall
cause Merger Sub to promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day of
such termination) terminate the Offer.

 



11 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents") and shall
disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. Unless previously withdrawn in accordance with
_Section 6.03_, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to include the Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and
to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by Applicable Law. The Company and its outside legal counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer
Documents and any amendments thereto prior to filing such documents with the
SEC or dissemination of such documents to the holders of Shares, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its outside legal counsel with any written comments
(and, in the case of any oral comments, shall provide such comments to the
Company and its outside legal counsel orally) Parent, Merger Sub or their
outside legal counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, shall consult
with the Company and its outside legal counsel (to whose comments reasonable
and good faith consideration shall be given) prior to responding to such
comments and shall provide to the Company and its outside legal counsel a copy
of any written responses thereto and telephonic notice of any material
discussions with the SEC staff.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement (including the exercise of the Top-Up
Option) and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and
Merger Sub, any Shares subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be
deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the shares
underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on behalf
of Merger Sub.

Section 2.02  _Company Actions_.

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Company has been advised that all of its directors and named
executive officers (as that term is defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K of
the Securities Act), who own Shares intend to tender their Shares pursuant to
the Offer. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any such shares held on
behalf of third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time,
the "Schedule 14D-9") including the Board Recommendation (subject to _Section
6.03_) and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the

 



12  holders of Shares. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by Applicable Law. Parent,
Merger Sub and their outside legal counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments
thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC or dissemination of such
documents to the holders of Shares, and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel. The Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub and their outside
legal counsel with any written comments (and, in the case of any oral
comments, shall provide such comments to Parent and Merger Sub and their
outside legal counsel orally) the Company or its outside legal counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the receipt of such comments, shall consult with Parent and Merger Sub
and their outside legal counsel (to whose comments reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given) prior to responding to such comments, and shall
provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their outside legal counsel a copy of any
written responses thereto and telephonic notice of any material discussions
with the SEC staff.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the most recent
practicable date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to
such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files and all other information in the
Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of the Shares,
and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including
updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files)
as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the holders of
Shares. Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence (and in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement) the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall,
upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in
their possession.

Section 2.03 _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within
two Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder,
waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 7_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of
such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its
terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 53
State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02109, unless another place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto.

 



13 Section 2.04 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
as soon as practicable after the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause
appropriate articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts for filing as provided in Section 11.06 of the
MBCA.

(b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time when the
Articles of Merger have been received for filing by the Secretary of State of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or at such later time and date as may be
agreed by the parties in writing and specified in the Articles of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the MBCA, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), and the separate corporate existence
of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in the MBCA.

Section 2.05 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to _Sections 2.05(b)_  and _(c)_ , the Company grants to Merger
Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), for so long as this Agreement
has not been terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, to purchase from the
Company the number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes the number of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Short-
Form Threshold") necessary for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company
without a vote or consent of the Companys stockholders in accordance with
Section 11.05 of the MBCA. Nothing herein shall be construed to obligate
Merger Sub to exercise the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up Option shall terminate
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement.

(b) The Top-Up Option may only be exercised one time by Merger Sub, in whole
but not in part, and only if clauses (i) and (ii) of the following sentence
are satisfied. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, promptly (but
in no event later than one Business Day) after the acceptance for payment of,
and payment by Merger Sub for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer (the "Acceptance Time") or the expiration of a subsequent offering
period if (i) at the Acceptance Time or the expiration of such subsequent
offering period Merger Sub owns in the aggregate at least 80% of all shares
of Company Common Stock then outstanding and (ii) after giving effect to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub would reach the Short-Form Threshold
(after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver the Top-Up Shares
upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that: (A)
the number of Top-Up Option Shares would not exceed the number of the
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock; (B) no legal restraint
or Order that has the effect of preventing the exercise of

 



14  the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares
in respect of such exercise shall be in effect; and (C) Merger Sub irrevocably
commits upon acquisition of the Top-Up Shares to effect the Merger pursuant
to _Section 6.04(d)_. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Option Shares shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up
Option Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price will
be paid by Merger Sub as follows: (x) the portion of the aggregate purchase
price equal to the par value of the Top-Up Shares shall be paid in cash and
(y) the balance of the remaining aggregate purchase price may be paid, by
Merger Sub, at its election, (I) in cash or (II) by executing and delivering
to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the
balance of the remaining aggregate purchase price, or some
combination thereof. Any such promissory note shall be full recourse against
Parent and Merger Sub, be due one year from the date the Top-Up Option Shares
are issued, bear interest at the rate of three percent (3%) per annum payable
quarterly, may be prepaid without premium or penalty and provide that the
unpaid principal and accrued interest thereunder shall immediately become due
and payable (a) in the event that Merger Sub fails to make any payment of
interest as provided therein and such failure continues for a period of 30
days or (b) upon the occurrence of customary bankruptcy or insolvency events
with respect to Merger Sub. The Company Board has determined that such
consideration for the Top-Up Option Shares is adequate.

(c) In the event that Merger Sub exercises the Top-Up Option, it shall deliver
to the Company a written notice (the "Top-Up Notice") setting forth (i) the
number of Shares that are expected to be owned by Merger Sub immediately
preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, (ii) the number of Top-Up Option
Shares that it intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (iii) the
manner in which it intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iv) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares by Merger Sub is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include
an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that promptly following such
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub intends to consummate the Merger in
accordance with Section 11.05 of the MBCA as contemplated by _Section
6.04(d)_. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger
Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to
be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option Shares and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Merger Sub such shares represented by book-entry. The
parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing
of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares to occur as promptly as possible,
and in any event no later than the first Business Day after the Top-Up Notice
is deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01_. The parties
further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
be consummated in accordance with Section 11.05 of the MBCA as contemplated
by _Section 6.04(d)_ as close in time as possible to (including, to the
extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.
Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate to ensure that any
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent
with all Applicable Law.

(d) Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares
that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent,
HoldCo and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger

 



15  Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in any appraisal proceeding under
Part 13 of the MBCA with respect to any dissenting Shares, the Surviving
Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares
or any cash or promissory note delivered to the Company in payment for such
Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in connection with the determination
of the fair value of the dissenting Shares in accordance with Part 13 of the
MBCA.

(f) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option shall not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or
a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation
of Applicable Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of
this  _Section 2.05(f)_ shall be null and void.

Section 2.06 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders thereof:

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.06(b)_, _Section 2.06(c)_,
_Section 2.06(d)_ or  _Section 2.08_, each Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

 

(b) each Share owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto;

(c) each Share held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of either the Company or
Parent (including HoldCo and Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.07 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration certificates representing Shares (the
"Certificates;"  _provided_ , _however_ , that any references herein to
"Certificates" are deemed to include references to book-entry

 



16  account statements relating to the ownership of Shares). As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Exchange Agent the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates (the "Payment
Fund"). To the extent such fund diminishes for any reason below the level
required to make prompt payment of the Merger Consideration, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the lost portion of
such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. Promptly after the Effective Time and in
any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder
of Shares at the Effective Time, in each case whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_,
a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery or transfer of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate promptly upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred each such
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of
such Certificate.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.07_
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



17 Section 2.08 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.06_ or
any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
(i) is entitled to appraisal, (ii) has not voted in favor of this Agreement or
the Merger or consented thereto in writing, to the extent approval by the
stockholders is required under the MBCA and (iii) has properly exercised
appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Part 13 of the MBCA shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with Part 13 of the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
holders right to appraisal, pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Part 13 of the MBCA, such Shares shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.06(a)_, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share.
The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA that relate to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.09 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards_.

 

(a) Each Company Stock Option, whether or not vested and exercisable, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, shall
become fully vested and exercisable as of the Acceptance Time. Each such
Company Stock Option shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per share exercise price
of such Company Stock Option, by (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (such product, the "Cash
Amount"). All payments provided pursuant to this _Section 2.09(a)_ shall be
made through the Companys payroll or accounts payable systems and,
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from such payments any amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the Code and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provisions of state,
local or foreign tax law. If the exercise price per share of any Company Stock
Option equals or exceeds the Offer Price, the Cash Amount therefor shall be
zero.

(b) Each Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time shall become fully vested and the restrictions with
respect thereto shall lapse as of the Acceptance Time and the Company
Restricted Stock Awards shall be treated in the same manner as the other
Shares in accordance with  _Section 2.06(a)_ and _Section 2.07_, subject to
any applicable Tax withholding requirements. In no event shall this _Section
2.09_ and _Section 2.07_ result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
any Company Restricted Stock Awards.

 



18 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions that are necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity
Awards pursuant to this  _Section 2.09_.

Section 2.10 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any applicable
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.12 _No Liability_. None of Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

Section 2.13 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate, as contemplated under this _Article 2_.

Section 2.14 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of Parent,
HoldCo, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take
all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the
Merger under the MBCA as promptly as commercially practicable. If at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of either of the Surviving Corporation or
Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of each of the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub or
otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.

Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (a "Standstill Release/Waiver")
(other than to the extent the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to provide a Standstill
Release/Waiver would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable law and that such Standstill Release/Waiver could reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal) and the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law each such agreement, (ii) amend or grant
any waiver or release or make any determination under or approve any
transaction or redeem any preferred stock purchase rights under the Company
Rights Agreement or take any action under the Company Rights Agreement to
facilitate an Acquisition Proposal except in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) approve any transaction under, or any
person becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Chapter 110F of the
Massachusetts General Laws except in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) consent to any take-over bid under
Chapter 110C of the Massachusetts General Laws except in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.03 _Board Recommendation_. 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.03(b)_ and _Section 6.03(c)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw, amend or
modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in any
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or the transactions (including pursuant
to the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement or any amendment thereto)
contemplated by this Agreement, the Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt or

of understanding, agreement in

 



46  principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (v) resolve or publicly propose to
take any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) (each of
the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to
as an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

(b)(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
the foregoing  _Section 6.03(a)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time
(and subject to compliance with _Section 9.04_), the Company Board or any
committee thereof may, if the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (A)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (1) a Superior
Proposal received after the date hereof or (2) any material fact, event,
change, development or circumstances not known by the Company Board as of the
date hereof and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal (such material fact,
event, change, development or circumstance, an "Intervening Event") or (B)
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ and to authorize and simultaneously to enter into a binding
written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, subject in each case to compliance with the terms of paragraph (ii)
or (iii) below, as applicable.

 

(ii) In the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change sought to be made under
clause (1) of _Section 6.03(b)(i)(A)_ or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ in response to a Superior Proposal, (x) no
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made
and (y) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_
may be made, in either case

(A) until after the fourth (4th) Business Day following written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board or any committee thereof
intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and
specifying the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the material terms
and conditions of, and the identity of the Third Party making, such Superior
Proposal, and a copy of any other relevant transaction documents (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal, which shall require a new notice period of two (2) Business Days,
and compliance with this _Section 6.03(b)_ with respect to such new notice),

(B) unless during such four (4) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day
period following an amended proposal), the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent
in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company Board or any committee thereof to
maintain the Board Recommendation and not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement, and

 



47 (C) unless, prior to the expiration of such four (4) Business Day period (or
two (2) Business Day period following an amended proposal), Parent does not
make a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the
Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel) to be at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal.

(iii) In the case of an Intervening Event, no Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made

 

(A) until after the fourth (4th) Business Day following written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board or any committee thereof
intends to take such action and specifying the facts underlying the Company
Boards (or any committee thereof) determination that an Intervening Event has
occurred, and the reason for the Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable
detail,

(B) unless during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, to the extent requested by Parent,
negotiate with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement
in such a manner that obviates the need for a Adverse Recommendation Change,
and 

(C) unless, by the expiration of such four (4) Business Day period, the
Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, taking into
consideration any amendments to this Agreement proposed by Parent (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel),
that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board or any committee thereof, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or any disclosure
requirements under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
compliance with such rules and Applicable Law will not in any way modify the
effect that any such action has if such disclosure constitutes an Adverse
Recommendation Change and (y) this _Section 6.03(c)_ shall not limit any of
Parents rights under _Article 8_ and _Section 9.04_ in respect of any such
position taken or disclosure made. 

Section 6.04 _Approval of Merger_.

(a) Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 11.05 of the
MBCA as contemplated by _Section 6.04(d)_, at Parents request, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the expiration of the Offer, the Company
shall prepare and file a proxy/information statement in preliminary form for
the Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto and any other required proxy materials, the "Proxy Statement")

 



48  seeking stockholder approval of the matters requiring Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement before it is
filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to all additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company shall include in the Proxy
Statement the Board Recommendation.

(b) The Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel with
copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments,
that the Company or its Representatives may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after
the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to all additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company
shall, after consultation with Parent and Merger Sub, respond promptly to any
comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by Applicable Law, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement, as so
corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and, if any
such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement as
provided in _Section 6.04(c)(ii)_, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by Applicable Law.

 

(c) Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 11.05 of the
MBCA as contemplated by _Section 6.04(d)_, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of the expiration of the Offer, the Company will,
in accordance with Applicable Law and the Companys governing documents, duly
set a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any adjournments and
postponements thereof, the "Stockholder Meeting") for the purpose of approving
the Merger and taking such other action requiring Stockholder Approval (with
the record date and meeting date set in consultation with Parent). Unless the
Company Board has withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in compliance with 
_Section 6.03_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of the holders of Shares required by Applicable
Law to effect the Merger. Once the Stockholder Meeting has been called and
noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Stockholder Meeting
without the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, except (i) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which it believes in good faith is necessary under Applicable Law
and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the holders of Shares prior to the Stockholder Meeting; _provided_
that in the event that the Stockholder Meeting is delayed to a date after the
End Date as a result of either (i) or (ii) above, then the End Date shall be
extended to the fifth Business Day after the date of the Stockholder Meeting.
Parent shall cause all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other
Shares owned by Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent to be
voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement.

 



49 (d) If, at any time following the Acceptance Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall own, in the aggregate, a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock necessary for Merger Sub to be merged into the Company without a vote or
consent of the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 11.05 of the
MBCA , then Parent and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of any such
shares held by Parent or its Subsidiaries, to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as possible after the Acceptance Time without the vote or
consent of the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 11.05 of the
MBCA.

Section 6.05 _Access to Information_. (a) Subject to Applicable Law, _Section
6.13(c)_, _Section 6.20_ and applicable contractual restrictions, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parents officers and Parents other authorized Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Acceptance Time, to its officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
Contracts and records. In addition, promptly following the date hereof and in
any event within forty-five (45) days, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to determine whether any funding of any Governmental
Authority, university, college, or other educational institution was used in
the development of any Company Intellectual Property Asset in connection with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted, and if any such instance is discovered, shall promptly disclose to
Parent such information and promptly make available to Parent any relevant
Contract associated therewith. The foregoing shall not require the Company
(a) to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any books,
Contracts or records governed by a confidentiality, non-disclosure or other
similar agreement in effect as of the date hereof, (b) to provide access to
or otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the extent
that the provision of such information would in the good faith judgment of the
Company based on advice of counsel jeopardize any attorney-client, work
product or other legal privilege or protection (it being agreed that, in the
case of clauses (a) and (b), that the Company shall give notice to Parent of
the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and thereafter
the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to violate such restriction or waive the applicable privilege or
protection), (c) to provide access to or otherwise make available any
information relating to the process conducted by the Company that led to the
execution of this Agreement, or (d) to provide access to or otherwise make
available or furnish any information if and to the extent that the provision
of such information could in the judgment of the Company based on advice of
counsel violate any Applicable Law. All requests for information made pursuant
to this _Section 6.05_ shall be directed to the executive officer or other
Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be deemed
Evaluation Material under and be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger
Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to,
contact any customer or supplier of the Company in connection with the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
Companys prior written consent, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that any such contact shall be arranged and supervised by
Representatives of the Company.

 



50 (b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
this  _Section 6.05_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to affect or
modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein,
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or otherwise prejudice in any
way the rights and remedies of Parent hereunder, nor shall any such
information, knowledge or investigation be deemed to affect or modify Parents
reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by
the Company in this Agreement.

Section 6.06 _Notice of Certain Events_. From the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
in writing of:

(a) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent of such party is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any Stockholder Litigation; and

(d) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that is reasonably likely,
individually or taken together with all other existing facts, events and
circumstances known to it, to result in the failure of any of the conditions
set forth on _Exhibit A_ or in _Article 7_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that
the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ shall not
be considered in determining whether the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_
or in _Article 7_ have been satisfied;

_provided_ , _however_ , that that no notification given by any party pursuant
to this _Section 6.06_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained
in this Agreement.

Section 6.07 _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Acceptance Time who are employed
by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Control Time ("Continuing Employees"), Parent shall
cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the Company and its
ERISA Affiliates prior to the Control Time to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals
or participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or
plan providing post-retirement medical or other similar benefits) and vesting
under each compensation, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the Surviving Corporation, but not including any
sabbatical or equity compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
(collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any Continuing Employee is
or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent service was
credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable Company
Employee Plan immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and to the extent such
credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

 



51 (b) For a period of not less than 12 months immediately following the
Acceptance Time, Parent shall provide Continuing Employees, considered in the
aggregate, with base salary, annual bonus opportunity and employee benefits
(excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program or arrangement) in the
aggregate no less favorable than those provided by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Continuing Employees as of the date of this
Agreement.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to
(i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such
Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to long-term disability and life
insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent permitted under the
terms and conditions of Parents applicable insurance contracts in effect as
of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of clarity,
to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions based on
periods of employment _Section 6.07(a)_ shall control; and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee and his eligible dependents with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and prior to the date
that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in such Parent Benefit
Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under
such Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that
such expenses were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company
Employee Plan.

(d) At least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the amount that could
be paid to each "disqualified individual" of the Company (as defined in
Section 280G(e) of the Code) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event)
and a copy of the estimated calculations and reasonable supporting
documentation in connection therewith, including the "base amount" (as defined
in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such disqualified individual.

 

(e) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this  _Section 6.07_ are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including any Company Employee, any participant
in any Company Employee Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to
continued employment with Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall be deemed to amend any
Parent Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to permit any Person to participate in any particular benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to
continue or amend any particular benefit plan, before or after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any
such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and
Applicable Law.

 



52 Section 6.08 _Change in Control Agreements_. Based on the Companys assurance
that such action would not give rise to any liability to any Company Employee
under Section 409A of the Code, Parent agrees that the Company shall be
entitled to take action to terminate each change in control agreement, policy,
plan or benefit listed on _Section 6.08_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
immediately before the Acceptance Time and Parent agrees to pay the severance
provided in each such change in control agreement in a lump sum to each
employee covered by each such change in control agreement upon the Acceptance
Time, whether or not such employee remains a Continuing Employee after the
Acceptance Time.

Section 6.09 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-
takeover Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger, the Tender and Voting Agreements or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable
Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 6.10 _Obligations of HoldCo and Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause each
of HoldCo and Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.11 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote any Shares beneficially
owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of approval of this Agreement
at the Stockholder Meeting, and will vote or cause to be voted the shares of
HoldCo or Merger Sub held by it or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, in favor of approval of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.12 _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) For six years after the Control Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Control Time
covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 6.12(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the
Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the
Company prior to the Control Time, which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Control
Time, including, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed 300% of the

 



53  Current Premium. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Control Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

(b) It is agreed that:

 

(i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company to any individual who at the Control Time is, or at any time prior to
the Control Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary
of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Party") under any indemnification
provision (including advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision,
in either case set forth in the articles of organization or bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and 

(ii) Parent shall, to the fullest extent that the Company is permitted to
under Applicable Law as in effect on the date of this Agreement, indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Party with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the consent of Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of one legal counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (and any required local counsel) as they are incurred) in
connection with any Proceeding whenever asserted, to the extent based on or
arising out of (A) the fact that an Indemnified Party was a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of
the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Control Time (including any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of
this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnified Party).

 

Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of
six (6) years from the Control Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification, exculpation and advancements in respect of any claim
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation fails to
comply with its obligations in this _Section 6.12(b)_ and an Indemnified
Party commences a suit which results in a determination that the Parent
or the Surviving Corporation failed to comply with such obligation, Parent
shall pay such Indemnified Party its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest thereon at the rate of interest per annum equal to the prime lending
rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any Independent
Directors, references in this _Section 6.12(b)_ to "Control Time" shall be
deemed replaced with "Effective Time."

 



54 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 6.12_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom
this _Section 6.12_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.12_ applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.12_).

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.12_.

 

Section 6.13 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of such steps as may be necessary (it
being understood that the Company and Parent shall be obligated only to use
reasonable best efforts in so doing) to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) the
delivery of required notices to, and the obtaining of required consents or
waivers from, Third Parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement. 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.13_, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) prepare and file
any notification and report forms and related material required under the HSR
Act, and any additional filings or notifications and related material required
under any applicable Foreign Competition Laws or that are necessary, proper
or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than fifteen (15)
Business Days from the date hereof for the filing of any notification and
report forms and related material required under the HSR Act) except by mutual
consent confirmed in writing); (ii) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable any information and documentary material that may
be requested by the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") or Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") under the HSR Act or by any Governmental Authority with
regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any Foreign Competition Laws
(each such Governmental Authority, a "Governmental Antitrust Authority"); and
(iii) use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary
or

 



55  advisable to obtain prompt approval of consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Antitrust Authority,
including to cause to be lifted any restraint, injunction or other legal
impediment to the Merger. Parent shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act,
and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments to any
Governmental Authority in connection with any filings under the HSR Act or
such other filings as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws (other
than normal filing fees that are imposed by Applicable Law on the Company).

(c) Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the
Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other
on, any filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) promptly inform each other of any communication (or
other correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the DOJ, FTC,
or any other Governmental Antitrust Authority, and (iii) promptly furnish each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between them or their subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and
Parent shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other party and its
counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any
discussion, telephone call or meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to participate in the
preparation for such discussion, telephone call or meeting. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to
stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or
applicable Foreign Competition Laws, without the prior written consent of the
other. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 6.13_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material".
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.13_, materials
provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(d) Parent shall have, except where prohibited by Applicable Law,
responsibility for determining the strategy for dealing with any Governmental
Authority regarding Applicable Law relating to antitrust matters.

 

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and
shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall, take any
action or propose, announce an intention or agree, in writing or otherwise, to
take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay
or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) notify
Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense and settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation. No compromise or
full or partial settlement of any Stockholder Litigation shall be agreed to by
the Company without Parents prior written consent.

 



56 Section 6.15 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement, or scheduling a press conference or conference call with investors
or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other
public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except as such release or announcement that Parent or
the Company determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is
required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association upon which the securities of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the
other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into
account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, and the party will consider such comments in good
faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required to consult with Parent before issuing any press
release or making any other public statement with respect to an Adverse
Recommendation Change effected in accordance with _Section 6.03_ or with
respect to its receipt and consideration of any Acquisition Proposal.

Section 6.16 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

Section 6.17 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and in
accordance with the Interpretative Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the
SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, to cause any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities with respect to equity securities
of the Company) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.18 _Directors_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and Nasdaq rules applicable to the Company,
promptly upon the Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate
such number of directors on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub
representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number
of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i)
the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage
that (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub or
any other Subsidiary of Parent (including Shares accepted for payment in the
Offer) bears to (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, promptly
take all necessary action to cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected;
_provided_ , _however_ ,

 



57  that in the event that Merger Subs designees are appointed or elected to
the Company Board, until the Effective Time the Company Board shall have at
least two directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who
are not officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Independent
Directors"); and _provided_ , _further_ , that, in such event, if the number
of Independent Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director shall be entitled to designate
a person to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent
Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then
remain, the other directors shall use reasonable best efforts to designate two
persons to fill such vacancies who are directors of the Company on the date of
this Agreement and who are not officers or affiliates of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub,
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if any vacancies remain, the other directors
shall designate persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers,
stockholders or affiliates of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent,
any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, and such persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option of Merger Sub, take all
necessary action to either increase the size of the Company Board or obtain
the resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to
enable Merger Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board
as provided above. At such time, the persons designated by Merger Sub shall,
as nearly as practicable, constitute at least the same percentage as persons
designated by Merger Sub to (1) each committee of the Company Board, (2) each
board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, and (3) each committee
of each such board, in each case only to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 6.18_ and shall include in or with the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is
required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l to fulfill its obligations under
this _Section 6.18_. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing any
information with respect to itself, Merger Sub and their respective nominees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
(c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subs designees pursuant
to this _Section 6.18_, the approval by affirmative vote or written consent
of all of the Independent Directors then in office shall be required to
authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of
the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including
any action by any committee thereof or any other director of the Company,
shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be required or permitted to
authorize) (i) any amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement
by the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation
or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any waiver or exercise of
any of the Companys rights under this Agreement, (iv) any determinations or
agreements made by or on behalf of the Company under this Agreement or (v) any
other matter in connection with the Merger that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the receipt of the Merger Consideration by the holder of
Shares (other than Parent and Merger Sub), including the timing of such
receipt. For purposes of considering any matter set forth in this _Section
6.18(b)_, the Independent Directors will be permitted to meet without the
presence of the other directors. The Independent Directors will have the
authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by
the Independent Directors

 



58  and will have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the Companys rights
hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Section 6.12_
shall apply to acts by the Independent Directors under this _Section 6.18_.
From and after the Acceptance Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take
any action to remove an Independent Director without cause.

Section 6.19 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of
Nasdaq to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company
Common Stock from the Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Company Common
Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event no more than ten days thereafter. Neither the Company
nor Parent shall cause such de-listing to occur prior to the Effective Time.

Section 6.20  _Confidentiality_. Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge
and agree to continue to be bound by the letter agreement dated as of January
25, 2012 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). 

Section 6.21 _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall take any action necessary to ensure that any Company
Arrangements entered into after the date hereof (or not previously approved as
contemplated by _Section 4.02(d)_) have been approved as contemplated by
Exchange Act Rule 14d-10 for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of
the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in paragraph (d) of such Rule.

inaccurate, _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that such breach by the Company or such inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Company are curable by the Company
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts prior to the End Date

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)(ii)_ until the earlier of the End
Date or the expiration of a 30 day period after delivery of written notice
from Parent to the Company of such breach or inaccuracy and

 



60  Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(c)(ii)_ if such breach or inaccuracy by the Company is cured within such

part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or (B) that any of
the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case, such that the breach
or failure to perform would give rise to a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that such breach by Parent or Merger Sub or such inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of Parent are curable by Parent or Merger Sub
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts prior to the End Date
and within 30 days, then the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(ii) _until the earlier of the End
Date or the expiration of a 30 day period after delivery of written
notice from the Company to Parent of such breach or inaccuracy and the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(d)(ii)_ if such breach or inaccuracy by Parent or Merger Sub is cured
within such period; __and (2) at the time of the delivery of such written
notice, the Company shall not be in breach of its obligations under this
Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement

the Offer resulted from the breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01_ (other than pursuant to  _Section 8.01(a))_ shall give notice of such
termination to each other party hereto.

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated

without liability of any party (or any Representative of such party) to each
other party hereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this
_Section 8.02_, _Section 6.20_ and _Article 9_ shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to _Section 8.01_; _provided_ , _further_ that nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree

connection with (a) a breach by

 



61  Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub of their respective obligations to commence and
complete the Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or (b) a material breach by any of them that has been the cause of,
or resulted in, failure of an Offer Condition, and that such damages shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company
or the holders of Shares (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including lost premium, other combination opportunities, the time value of
money and any relevant breaches by the Company, Parent, HoldCo or Merger
Sub), in each case to the extent not otherwise recoverable by such holders.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly acknowledged that notwithstanding

any third-party beneficiary rights under, or any right to enforce, the terms
of this Agreement.

and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 9.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) Subject to  _Section 6.18_, any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived at any time before or after approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the respective Boards of
Directors or stockholders of the parties hereto if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
without the further approval of the Companys stockholders, no such amendment
or waiver shall be made or given that requires the approval of the
stockholders of the Company under the MBCA unless the required further
approval is obtained.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.18_, any failure of any of the parties to
comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the parties entitled
to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by each such party
granting such waiver. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 9.04 _Fees; Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in

$64,000,000 (the "Termination Fee").

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)(i)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than one
Business Day after termination of this Agreement, pay Parent the Termination

63 (d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or 
_Section 8.01(c)(ii)_ and (i) prior to such termination an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not irrevocably withdrawn
prior to such termination, and (ii) within twelve months following the date of
such termination the Company shall have (A) entered into a letter of intent
or a definitive agreement with respect to, (B) recommended to its stockholders
or (C) consummated a transaction specified in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal", then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee
on the first Business Day after such event. For purposes of this _Section
9.04(d) _the references "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)."

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
_Section 9.04_ shall be payable only once with respect to this _Section
9.04_ and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one
or more provisions hereof.

 

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that without such provisions Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered
into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee or any
portion thereof and Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in an
Order against the Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the
Company shall pay Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the Termination Fee (or any portion thereof
that has not been paid timely in accordance with this Agreement) and on the
amount of such costs and expenses at the rate of interest per annum equal to
the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

 

Section 9.05 _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Parent or
Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of
its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for the provisions of _Section 6.08_ and _Section 6.12_,
which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting
therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof
and who may enforce the covenants contained therein. For the avoidance of
doubt, no holder of Shares shall have any third-party beneficiary rights under
_Section 8.02_ or any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom located in
Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and
any appellate court therefrom. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to enforcement of any of the
terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action,
suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each Party
agrees that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the
manner contemplated by _Section 9.01_ or in any other manner permitted by
law.

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Section 9.09 _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, except as expressly provided in the following sentence. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such state court has
proper jurisdiction, the Federal court of the District of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom, and, in any action
for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_, a party
shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief
that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including monetary
damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement in the event
that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.09_ are not available or otherwise are not
granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.09_ shall require any
party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section
9.09_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ or anything
set forth in this _Section 9.09_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.

 



65 Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other

Conditions of the Offer

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer but subject to the terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept
for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Exchange Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to Merger Subs obligation to
pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or
withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
and, only after complying with any obligation to extend the Offer pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, may terminate the Offer, if:

(i) there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer that number of Shares which, when added to any Shares
already owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, would represent at least two-
thirds (66 2/3%) of the Shares on a Fully Diluted basis (the "Minimum Tender
Condition");

 

(ii)(a) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired
or been terminated, (b) the approval of the Federal Cartel Office of the
Federal Republic of Germany shall not have been obtained or deemed obtained
pursuant to German merger control rules or (c) the approval or clearance or a
waiver of jurisdiction or a determination that a filing is not required by
the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission shall not have been obtained or the relevant
applicable waiting period shall not have expired or been terminated pursuant
to Taiwanese merger control rules (the "Antitrust Condition");

 

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of expiration of
the Offer:

 

(A) any Order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a Governmental
Authority, or any Law shall be in effect that would (1) make the Offer or the
Merger illegal or (2) otherwise prevent the consummation thereof;

(B) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred and be
continuing any event, change, effect or development that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

(C)(1) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in _Section
4.02_ or _Section 4.05_ of the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct
in all but immaterial respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as
of such time, except to the extent such representation and warranty expressly
relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such earlier time) or
(2) any other representation and warranty of the Company set forth in the
Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representation and
warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such
earlier time), other than in the case of clause (2) for such failures to be
true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (it
being understood that for this purpose all references to the term
"Company Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on the word
"material," except for the reference to the term "Company Material Adverse

 



70  Effect" in _Section 4.10_, shall be disregarded). Solely for the purposes
of clause (1) above, if one or more inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties referred to in such clause resulted in or would result in
aggregate monetary losses or damages of less than $5,000,000, such
inaccuracies will be deemed immaterial;

(D) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant
of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger
Agreement prior to such time;

(E) the Company fails to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by a senior
executive officer of the Company dated the date on the which the Offer expires
certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (C) and (D) of this
paragraph (iii) do not exist; or

 

(F) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

 

The foregoing conditions set forth in clause (ii) and clause (iii) above are
for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent or
Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the
sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in each case to the terms of
the Merger Agreement and applicable Law. Any reference in this Exhibit A or in
the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be
deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived. The foregoing
conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The
failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that
the term "Merger Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this Exhibit A is attached.
