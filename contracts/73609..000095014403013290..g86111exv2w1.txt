                  THIS ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT is made as of November 24, 2003
(this "Agreement") by and among Oakwood Homes Corporation, a North Carolina
corporation ("OHC"), and the other Persons identified as "Sellers" on the
Identification of Sellers Section of Sellers' Disclosure Schedule (collectively
with OHC, "Sellers" and each individually, a "Seller"), and Clayton Homes, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser").

                                    RECITALS

                  1.       Sellers and their Subsidiaries are engaged in the
business of designing, manufacturing, marketing and financing the sale of
manufactured and modular homes (the "Business");

                  2.       Sellers (other than the Non-Debtor Sellers) are
debtors and debtors-in-possession under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United
States Code, 11 U.S.C. Sections 101-1330 (as amended, the "Bankruptcy Code"),
having commenced voluntary cases (No. 02-13396 (PJW) (Jointly Administered))
(the "Reorganization Cases") on November 15, 2002 (the "Petition Date") in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "U.S.
Bankruptcy Court");

                  3.       Pursuant to Sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the
Bankruptcy Code, Sellers (other than the Non-Debtor Sellers) continue to operate
their respective businesses and manage their respective properties, and are
administering their respective estates created by Section 541 of the Bankruptcy
Code on the Petition Date (the "Estates");

                  4.       The boards of directors, general partners or other
managing authorities of Sellers have each determined that, subject to (i) the
conduct of a full, fair and open Auction, (ii) notice to all creditors and
equityholders of Sellers (other than the Non-Debtor Sellers) and (iii)
confirmation of the Plan by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court (as detailed in Section
4.07 below), it is advisable and in the best interests of the Estates, the
beneficiaries of such Estates and the equity holders of the Non-Debtor Sellers
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon the terms
and conditions set forth herein;

                  5.       The board of directors of Purchaser has determined
that it is advisable and in the best interests of its stockholders to
consummate, and has approved, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

                  6.       Sellers (other than the Non-Debtor Sellers) have
agreed, upon approval of the Bidding Procedures Motion by the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, to file an amended plan of reorganization (the "Plan") with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to effect (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, or (ii) an Alternative
Transaction; and

                  7.       Pursuant to Section 4.07 below Sellers (other than
the Non-Debtor Sellers) have agreed to: (i) transmit an amended disclosure
statement with respect to the Plan (the "Disclosure Statement"), once approved
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, to holders of claims and

equity interests in the Reorganization Cases, soliciting acceptance of the Plan,
and (ii) seek entry of an order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court (the "Confirmation
Order") confirming the Plan pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code (the
date on which the Confirmation Order is entered is hereinafter referred to as
the "Confirmation Date").

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions herein
contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

                  1.04     Purchase Price; Allocation; Adjustment.

                           (a)      Purchase Price. Purchaser hereby agrees to
purchase the Transferred Assets from Sellers and to pay or cause to be paid to
Sellers the Total Purchase Price. The "Total Purchase Price" shall mean (i)
$372,500,000 (the "Initial Purchase Price"), (ii) minus the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, (iii) plus or minus, as appropriate, any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 1.04(c), (iv) minus the Assumed Rebate Liabilities, (v)
minus the Warranty Service Liability Amount, (vi) plus the Additional Loan
Amount, (vii) minus the Asset Adjustment Amount, (viii) plus or minus, as
appropriate, the P&I Advances Adjustment Amount and (ix) minus the Contract
Escrow Offset Amount. The "Estimated Purchase Price" shall mean (i) the Initial
Purchase Price, (ii) plus or minus, as appropriate, any amounts determinable on
the Closing Date payable pursuant to Section 1.04(c), (iii) minus the Assumed
Rebate Liabilities, (iv) minus the Warranty Service Liability Amount, (v) minus
the Asset Adjustment Amount and (vi) plus the Additional Loan Amount.

                           (b)      Allocation of Purchase Price. Within 180
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to the Estates copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto with
Purchaser's proposed allocation of the purchase price among the Transferred
Assets (including a breakdown by legal entity). Within 60 days after the receipt
of such Form 8594, the Estates shall propose to Purchaser any changes to such
Form 8594 or shall indicate their concurrence therewith, which concurrence shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The failure by the Estates to propose any such
change within 60 days shall be deemed to be an indication of their concurrence
with such Form 8594. Any disputes with respect to the allocation of purchase
price which Purchaser and the Estates, acting in good faith, are unable to
resolve shall be submitted to Independent Accountants for a final determination.
Each party hereto agrees that no party will take a position on any income,
transfer or gains Tax Return, before any Governmental or Regulatory Authority
charged with the collection of any such Tax or in any judicial proceeding, that
is in any manner inconsistent with the terms of any such allocation without the
prior written consent of the other party.

                           (c)      Proration of Real Property Charges. The
Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by
the net amount calculated as being for the account of Purchaser or Sellers, as
the case may be, in connection with the Real Property Leases and the Real
Property, after netting all of the following adjustments: the pro-rata share
accrued to the Effective Time of ordinary course bills for utility charges
(electricity, water, sewer and natural gas), telephone charges, real property
and personal property Taxes, common area maintenance charges, insurance premiums
due or accrued, payroll Taxes, garbage collection, rent and other customarily
proratable items. The adjustments referred to in this Section 1.04(c) shall
reflect, in accordance with GAAP, the principle that all expenses and income
attributable to the period at or after the Effective Time are for the account of
Purchaser and all expenses and income attributable to the period before the
Effective Time are for the account of Sellers. If the amount of any proratable
item cannot be determined as at Closing, the amount thereof shall be estimated
and, within twenty (20) days following the Closing, such amount shall be
finalized and any difference between the estimated amount and the actual amount
of the proratable items shall be paid by the Estates to Purchaser or by
Purchaser to the Estates on behalf of Sellers, as applicable, and the Total
Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate.

Time").

                           (b)      Payment of Purchase Price. At the direction

Estimated Purchase Price, less the Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available United States funds to the Estates for distribution
pursuant to the Plan, the account information for such wire transfer to be

Agreement").

Advances, the Contract Escrow Offset Amount and the Total Purchase Price
Calculation, and if Sellers disagree with the Schedule of Closing Date Working
Capital Assets, the Schedule of Closing Date P&I Advances, the Contract Escrow
Offset Amount or the Total Purchase Price Calculation, then Sellers shall,
within such 20-Business Day period, deliver to Purchaser a written proposed
adjustment to the Schedule of Closing Date Working Capital Assets, the Schedule
of Closing Date P&I Advances, the Contract Escrow Offset Amount and/or the Total
Purchase Price Calculation ("Sellers' Adjustment Request") setting forth (A) the

Sellers' Adjustment Request to agree upon any adjustments to the Schedule of
Closing Date Working Capital Assets, the Schedule of Closing Date P&I Advances,
the Contract Escrow Offset Amount and the Total Purchase Price Calculation
proposed in Sellers' Adjustment Request. Upon the expiration of such 15-day
period, Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, may demand in
writing that any or all disputes reflected in Sellers' Adjustment Request be
submitted for resolution to an independent certified public accounting firm of
recognized national standing designated by the requesting party, which firm
shall be subject to approval by the other party, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld (such firm, the "Independent Accountants"). As promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days after such demand,
Sellers and Purchaser shall deliver to the Independent Accountants written
submissions supporting their respective positions with respect to such dispute.
The decision of the Independent Accountants with respect to the Schedule of
Closing Date Working Capital Assets, the Schedule of Closing Date P&I Advances,
the Contract Escrow Offset Amount, the Total Purchase Price Calculation and
Sellers' Adjustment Request, and any dispute relating thereto, shall be final
and binding on the parties hereto and may be enforced as an arbitration award in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

Accountants incurred in connection with this Section 1.08 or Section 1.04(b)
shall be borne equally as between Purchaser and Sellers. Upon delivery of the
Schedule of Closing Date Working Capital Assets,

                                      -12-

Total Purchase Price Calculation.

                           (c)      Within ten (10) days after the final
determination of the Total Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.04(a) and this
Section 1.08, (i) if the Total Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, (A) Purchaser shall pay to the Estates on behalf of Sellers by wire
transfer of immediately available United States funds an amount equal to such
excess, without set-off or deduction of any kind, and (B) Purchaser and Sellers
shall deliver a written notice to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Escrow Amount to the Estates
on behalf of Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available United States
funds, without set-off or deduction of any kind, within five (5) Business Days
of receipt of such instruction or (ii) if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds
the Total Purchase Price, Purchaser and Sellers shall deliver a written notice
to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow
Agent to pay (A) an amount equal to such excess from the Escrow Amount to
Purchaser and (B) the remainder of the Escrow Amount, if any, to the Estates on
behalf of Sellers, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available United
States funds, without set-off or deduction of any kind, within five (5) Business
Days of receipt of such instruction; provided, that in the event the Escrow
Amount is insufficient to pay to Purchaser the full amount by which the
Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Total Purchase Price, the Estates shall pay
to Purchaser the amount by which the Escrow Amount is insufficient by wire
transfer of immediately available United States funds, without set-off or
deduction of any kind.

                           (d)      Interest on and other income from the Escrow
Amount shall be payable in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

                                      -13-

transfer and assign to Sellers and their successors and assigns under this
Agreement (without cost or obligation to any Seller or successor or assign) any
third-party warranties that constitute Transferred Assets to the extent such
third-party warranties relate to any liabilities or obligations that any Seller
has retained under this Agreement in the event that any claim is made against
any Seller with respect to any such retained liability or obligation.

                           (b)      In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of Sellers in Sections 4.01(a) and 4.02, following the issuance by the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court of an Order approving the Bidding Procedures Motion,
Sellers shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, use commercially

respect to the transactions contemplated hereby made by any Governmental or
Regulatory

                                      -22-

Authority. If any action or proceeding in any court or other tribunal is
instituted or threatened to be instituted by any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative

Bankruptcy Court of an Order approving the Bidding Procedures Motion, Sellers
will, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to, (a) make the filings
required of Sellers or their respective Affiliates under the HSR Act within five
(5) Business Days after the issuance of such Order approving the Bidding
Procedures Motion but in no event later than December 16, 2003, (b) comply at
the earliest practicable date with any request for additional information
received by Sellers or their respective Affiliates from the Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
("DOJ") pursuant to the HSR Act, and (c) cooperate with Purchaser in connection
with Purchaser's filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement commenced by either the FTC or the DOJ or state attorneys general.

                  4.03     Bidding Procedures. Each Seller acknowledges that
this Agreement is the culmination of an extensive process undertaken by Sellers
to identify and negotiate a transaction with a bidder who is prepared to pay the
highest and best purchase price for the Transferred Assets while assuming or
otherwise satisfying the Assumed Liabilities. Set forth as Exhibit H hereto are
the bidding procedures (the "Bidding Procedures") to be employed, subject only
to U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval (the form of which is also set forth in
Exhibit H), with respect to the sale of the Business. Within two (2) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement, Sellers (other than the Non-Debtor Sellers)
will file a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the approval of the
Bidding Procedures and the provisions of this Agreement to be performed by
Sellers (other than the Non-Debtor Sellers) before the Closing (including
Sections 1.09, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05 and 4.07), and Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of this
Agreement (including the Break-Up Fee) (the "Bidding Procedures Motion"). The
hearing on the Bidding Procedures Motion shall be held after the date of this
Agreement and the parties shall work in good faith to obtain a hearing date as
early as possible, which, in any event, shall be no later than December 15,
2003. The sale of the Business is subject to competitive bidding as set forth in
the Bidding Procedures and approval of the Bidding Procedures Motion by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court. The overbid provisions and related bid protections in the
Bidding Procedures are designed to compensate Purchaser for its efforts and
agreements to date and to facilitate a full and fair process designed to
maximize the value of the Transferred Assets for the benefit of each Seller's
stakeholders.

issuance by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of an Order approving the Bidding
Procedures Motion, each Seller (other than the Non-Debtor Sellers) shall file
the Plan and the Disclosure Statement with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to effect,

the Disclosure Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. In such event, Sellers (other than the
Non-Debtor Sellers) shall make the appropriate filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court regarding such misstatement or omission and take such other actions to

filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, contains "adequate information" (as that
term is defined in Section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code). The Disclosure
Statement shall contain a recommendation of each of Sellers (other than the
Non-Debtor Sellers) that holders of claims against or interests in the Sellers
entitled to vote on the Plan vote to accept the Plan, subject to Sellers' right
to withdraw such recommendation upon their acceptance of a proposal for an
Alternative Transaction or upon termination of this Agreement as contemplated by
Section 8.01.

                           (c)      If the Confirmation Order or any other
Orders of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement, the Disclosure
Statement, the solicitation of acceptance of the Plan or the confirmation of the
Plan shall be appealed by any party (or a petition for certiorari or motion for
rehearing or reargument shall be filed with respect thereto), Sellers agree to
take such steps, if any, as may be reasonable and appropriate to prosecute such

petition or motion or defend against such appeal, petition or motion and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an expedited resolution of any such
appeal, petition or motion.

                  4.08     Tax Matters.

                           (a)      Subject to Section 1146 of the Bankruptcy
Code, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding
any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, share
transfer and stamp duty or taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and
other fees, and any similar Taxes (together, the "Conveyance Taxes") which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the extent any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not exempted from any such Conveyance Tax under Section 1146 of the
Bankruptcy Code, Purchaser shall be liable for and shall hold Sellers and the
Estates harmless against such Conveyance Taxes.

                           (b)      Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay all Taxes levied by
any foreign, federal, state, municipal or local taxing authority in any
jurisdiction with respect to the ownership, use or leasing of the Transferred
Assets after the Closing Date, and Sellers shall be responsible for and shall
pay all such Taxes with respect to the ownership, use or leasing of the
Transferred Assets on or prior to the Closing Date. To the extent that Sellers
have paid, prior to Closing, any Taxes for which Purchaser would be responsible
pursuant to the previous sentence, Sellers shall provide written notice of such
amounts no later than 30 days after the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall,
within five Business Days of receipt of such notice, pay such amounts to the
Estates.

                  4.09     Access to Information. Each Seller shall, and shall
cause its respective officers, employees, and other Representatives to, afford
to Purchaser and its Representatives access, at all reasonable times and in a
manner so as not to interfere with (a) its normal business operations, (b) the
Bidding Procedures or (c) any efforts by Sellers to obtain capital or financing
for or otherwise to effectuate any of the alternatives to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement set forth in the Plan, to its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records relating to the Business and
shall, and shall cause its respective officers, employees and other
Representatives to, furnish to Purchaser any and all information concerning its
properties, financial condition, operations and personnel relating to the
Business as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request.

                  4.10     Post-Closing Payments. Any payments to which
Purchaser is entitled under this Agreement which are received by Sellers or the
Estates following the Effective Time shall be received by Sellers or the
Estates, as the case may be, solely in trust for Purchaser and the full amount
of such payments (without deduction or set-off of any kind) shall be promptly
remitted to or for the account of Purchaser.

                  4.11     Employees. Sellers shall grant Purchaser access to
all Employees to allow Purchaser to evaluate such Employees for potential
employment with Purchaser after the Closing Date, subject to any such Employee's
satisfaction of any and all employment requirements imposed by Purchaser. Prior
to the Effective Time, Sellers shall terminate the

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

employment of all Employees as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date other than any Employees who shall continue to be
employed by OHC after the Effective Time. On or before the third Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall offer to hire, or cause one or more
of its Affiliates to offer to hire, a minimum of eighty percent (80%) of all
Eligible Employees of Sellers on the date of this Agreement on terms, including
compensation and benefits, equivalent to employees of Purchaser or its
Affiliates in comparable positions. All Eligible Employees who are offered
employment by Purchaser and accept such offer of employment shall be hired by
Purchaser, or one or more of its Affiliates, effective as of the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive all limitations as
to insured preexisting health conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Eligible
Employees hired by Purchaser or its Affiliates under any welfare benefit, 401(k)
and similar plans that such Eligible Employees may be eligible to participate in
after the Closing other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such Eligible Employees and that have not been satisfied
as of the Closing Date under any such plan maintained for such Eligible
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each such
Eligible Employee with credit for the years of service of such Eligible Employee
with Sellers under any welfare benefit, 401(k) and similar plan in which the
Eligible Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing. Sellers shall
be liable and responsible for and pay any and all liabilities and obligations
(a) under the WARN Act arising out of or resulting from termination by Sellers
of Sellers' Employees, and (b) otherwise associated with the termination and
severance by Sellers of all Employees of Sellers or the retention of the
Employees who continue to be employed by OHC after the Effective Time, including
any and all obligations to provide such Employees with continued health,
disability, life or other retirement benefits (whether covered by insurance or
not), including COBRA benefits (all such liabilities and obligations,
collectively, the "Employee Retained Liabilities").

                  4.12     Environmental Reports. Promptly following the date
hereof, Sellers shall cause to be prepared, at Sellers' sole expense, Phase I
Reports for all of its manufacturing facilities for which such a report has not
been delivered to Purchaser. Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a copy of each
Phase I Report promptly upon its receipt by Sellers provided that copies of all
such Phase I Reports shall be delivered to Purchaser prior to December 13, 2003
and, in all events, seventy-five percent (75%) of such Phase I Reports shall be
delivered to Purchaser no later than six (6) Business Days prior to the Auction
and the balance of such Phase I Reports shall be delivered to Purchaser no later
than four (4) Business Days prior to the Auction. In the event any conditions
described in any such report with respect to a non-operating manufacturing
facility could reasonably be expected to result in any remediation costs being
imposed on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, Purchaser shall be entitled (in
its sole discretion) to designate such manufacturing facility as an Excluded
Asset by providing notice of such designation to Sellers no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Auction and, following such notice, such
manufacturing facility shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes of
this Agreement; provided, that any such designation shall have no effect on the
purchase price under this Agreement. In the event any conditions described in
such reports with respect to manufacturing facilities (other than any
manufacturing facility designated as an Excluded Asset pursuant to the preceding
sentence) could reasonably be expected to result in remediation costs being
imposed on Purchaser and any of its Affiliates in the aggregate in excess of
$5,000,000, Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement, without any
Liability on its part (or on the part of any of its Representatives and
Affiliates), by providing notice of such

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

termination to Sellers no later than two (2) Business Day prior to the Auction;
provided, however, that this Agreement shall not be terminated if, following
such notice of termination by Purchaser but no later than one (1) Business Day
prior to the Auction, Sellers notify Purchaser of Sellers' election to pay
pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser (or deduct from
the purchase price under this Agreement) the amount of such remediation costs in
excess of $5,000,000 and further provided that (if the Closing occurs) under no
circumstance shall Sellers be liable for any such remediation costs under
$5,000,000 and such remediation costs shall not affect the purchase price
hereunder. In the event of any termination by Purchaser solely under this
Section 4.12, Purchaser shall not be entitled to the Break-Up Fee.

                  4.13     Pooling and Servicing Agreements. Section 4.13 of
Sellers' Disclosure Schedule lists the pooling and servicing agreements that
contain the embedded servicing agreements under which Oakwood Servicing Holdings
Co., LLC ("OSHC") is currently the "Servicer" (collectively, the "Servicing
Agreements"). Prior to the Effective Time, OSHC shall resign from its duties and
obligations as "Servicer" for the term securitizations under all of the
Servicing Agreements other than those (if any) listed as "Excluded Servicing
Agreements" on Section 4.13 of Sellers' Disclosure Schedule, and the respective
securitization trustee under each such Servicing Agreement shall have appointed
a subsidiary of Purchaser (designated by Purchaser) as the successor servicer
(such subsidiary, the "New Servicer") under each such Servicing Agreement;
provided, that Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc., a Tennessee corporation
("Vanderbilt"), shall be the subservicer to the New Servicer or, at Purchaser's
election, the New Servicer. In connection with each such appointment, (a) the
applicable securitization trustee shall confirm that the New Servicer's
servicing responsibilities under each of the Servicing Agreements shall be
solely on a "going forward" basis, (b) the applicable securitization trustee
shall confirm that the New Servicer shall not be liable or responsible for any
obligations, liabilities or expenses of any type whatsoever (whether direct,
contingent, known, unknown or otherwise), arising from or relating to acts,
omissions, occurrences, defaults or breaches occurring or failing to occur under
or in connection with the Servicing Agreements or related securitization
facility documents (including the related pooling and servicing agreement) prior
to the appointment of the New Servicer, (c) the applicable securitization
trustee shall confirm that the New Servicer is entitled to all the rights of the
Servicer under the Servicing Agreements (including rights to servicing fees,
advance reimbursements etc.) without setoff or deduction for any prior
Servicer's acts or omissions, (d) the applicable securitization trustee shall
confirm that the rates and priority of the Servicing Fees payable to New
Servicer are the same as the rates and priority of the Servicing Fees previously
paid to OSHC (which rates are set forth in Section 4.13 of Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and which Servicing Fee payments are senior in priority with respect to
securitization trust payments and distributions), and (e) confirmation shall be
provided that the existing Subservicing Agreements between OSHC and Oakwood
Acceptance Corporation ("OAC") have been terminated. Prior to the Effective
Time, the requisite consents, notices and approvals in order to validly effect
the foregoing shall have been obtained, including the requisite consents from
each of the trustees and requisite ratings agency letters, as applicable. Unless
otherwise directed by Purchaser in writing, the Sellers acknowledge and covenant
that Sellers shall use their good faith efforts to effect the foregoing, and
Sellers, upon request by Purchaser, will cooperate with Purchaser in allowing
representatives of Purchaser, following approval of the Bidding Procedures
Motion by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, to discuss and negotiate successor servicer
terms directly with the applicable securitization trustees, but in the event the
Sellers are unable to obtain the requisite consents,

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

notices, approvals and confirmations in order to validly effect the foregoing
after pursuing such good faith efforts, the parties agree that in lieu of
obtaining the consents and approvals referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence, Sellers may satisfy their obligations under this Section 4.13 by
commencing a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy on behalf of OSHC and assuming and
assigning the Servicing Agreements to the New Servicer pursuant to an order
entered under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, provided that, for Sellers to
have satisfied their obligations under this Section 4.13 through such an
order,(i) the order authorizing such assumption and assignment shall be in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the New Servicer, (ii) at least ten days shall
have passed since the entry of such order and such order shall not be subject to
any stay, appeal or motion for rehearing, reconsideration or revocation, and
(iii) such order shall provide that (a) the New Servicer's servicing
responsibilities under the Servicing Agreements shall be solely on a "going
forward" basis, (b) the New Servicer shall not be liable or responsible for any
obligations, liabilities or expenses of any type whatsoever (whether direct,
contingent, known, unknown or otherwise), arising from or relating to acts,
omissions, occurrences, defaults or breaches occurring or failing to occur under
or in connection with the Servicing Agreements or related securitization
facility documents (including the related pooling and servicing agreement) prior
to the appointment of the New Servicer, (c) the New Servicer shall be entitled
to all the rights of the Servicer under the Servicing Agreements (including
rights to servicing fees, advance reimbursements etc.) without setoff or
deduction for any prior Servicer's acts or omissions, (d) the rates and priority
of the Servicing Fees payable to New Servicer under the Servicing Agreements are
the same as the rates and priority of the Servicing Fees previously paid to OSHC
(which rates are set forth in Section 4.13 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule and
which Servicing Fee payments are senior in priority with respect to
securitization trust payments and distributions), and (e) the existing
Subservicing Agreements between OSHC and OAC have been or are thereby
terminated. In connection with any motion seeking the entry of such assignment
and assumption order, the applicable securitization trustees, securitization
certificateholders and any and all creditors of OSHC or OAC with claims (as such
term is defined in Section 101(12) of the Bankruptcy Code) ("Potential
Claimants") shall have received at least fifteen days prior written notice in
accordance with the Bankruptcy Code (including any applicable rules) and all
parties in interest, including the Potential Claimants shall have had good and
sufficient time to object or otherwise respond to the relevant motion period.
Any costs in connection with such assumption and assignment (including any cure
costs) shall be borne by Sellers. In addition, those Sellers who hold residual
interests in REMIC trusts the servicing for which is being assigned to the New
Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.13 shall have agreed (to the extent they
have a right to exercise a "terminating purchase" or clean-up call), on behalf
on themselves and their respective transferees, to provide New Servicer a first
right of exercise of any such terminating purchase or clean-up call under the
respective Servicing Agreements.

                  Purchaser, on the one hand, and each Seller, on the other,

                  5.01     Regulatory and Other Approvals.

                           (a)      Following entry of an Order of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court approving the Bidding Procedures Motion, Purchaser will, as
promptly as practicable, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents, approvals or actions of, make all filings with and give all notices to
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or any other Person required of Purchaser
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Operative
Agreements, provided, however, that Purchaser shall be under no obligation to
provide any financial incentive to any Person for its grant of any consent or
approval required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Operative Agreements, (ii) provide such other information and communications to
such Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or other Persons as such
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or other Persons may reasonably request
in connection therewith and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation to Sellers in
connection with the performance of their obligations under Sections 4.01 and
4.02. Purchaser will provide prompt notification to Sellers when any such
consent, approval, action, filing or notice referred to in clause (i) above is
obtained, taken, made or given, as applicable.

                           (b)      In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of Purchaser in Section 5.01(a) above, following entry of an Order of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approving the Bidding Procedures Motion, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) make the filings required of
Purchaser or its Affiliates under the HSR Act within five (5) Business Days
after the issuance of such Order approving the Bidding Procedures Motion but in

date with any request for additional information received by Purchaser or its
Affiliates from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act, (iii) cooperate with
Sellers in connection with their filing under the HSR Act and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement commenced by either the FTC or the DOJ or state
attorneys general, and (iv) not knowingly take or cause to be taken any action,
including the acquisition of any business, voting securities (or other ownership
interests) or assets, which would reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent any consents, approvals and actions of any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority (including under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                           (c)      In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of Purchaser as set forth in Sections 5.01(a) and (b) above, following
entry of an Order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approving the Bidding Procedures
Motion, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby made by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority. If any
action or proceeding in any domestic or foreign court or other tribunal is
instituted or threatened to be instituted by any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative
of any Law, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
action as will (i) resolve any objections which any such Governmental or
Regulatory Authority may have to such transactions, (ii) avoid the entry of, or
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order which has, or will have, the effect of preventing or interfering with the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) obtain
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority, provided, however, that, notwithstanding the provisions

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

of this Section 5.01 or any other provision in this Agreement (other than the
proviso to Section 6.05) to the contrary, in no event shall Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to agree to, nor shall any Sellers
agree to (a) any prohibition of or limitation on the ownership or operation by
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any portion of their
respective businesses, product lines or assets, including those related to the
Transferred Assets, or any of the Transferred Assets, (b) divest, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of any portion of its or their respective businesses,
product lines or assets, including those related to the Transferred Assets, or
any Transferred Assets, or (c) any other limitation on Purchaser's or any of its
Subsidiaries' or Affiliates' ability to effectively control their respective
businesses or operations, including those related to the Transferred Assets, or
any of the Transferred Assets; provided, further, that Purchaser agrees to take,

with Sellers to ensure that the Plan and the Disclosure Statement, as filed with
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, contain "adequate information" (as that term is
defined in Section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code). Purchaser shall from time to
time furnish to Sellers all such information about Purchaser required to be
disclosed in the Disclosure Statement. Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers
if at any time before the Effective Date it becomes aware that the Disclosure
Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

                           (c)      If the Confirmation Order or any other
Orders of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement, the Disclosure
Statement, the solicitation of acceptance of the Plan or confirmation of the
Plan shall be appealed by any party (or a petition for certiorari or motion for
rehearing or reargument shall be filed with respect thereto), Purchaser agrees
to assist and cooperate with Sellers in Sellers' efforts, if any, to prosecute
such appeal, petition or motion or defend against such appeal, petition or
motion, with the objective of effecting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that Purchaser's obligations under this Section 5.02(c)
shall not require it to incur any legal costs or other out-of-pocket expenses,
or file any separate appeal, petition or motion.

of this Section 5.06, and other than information required to be disclosed by Law
or stock exchange rule in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby).
Purchaser shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 5.06 by any
Affiliate or Purchaser Representative. If such transactions are not consummated,
Purchaser shall return to Sellers all such documents received and shall destroy
all copies of such documents and all documents or materials containing
information derived from such documents and shall continue to hold all such

(approving the Plan in a form providing for the effectuation of all the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms and
provisions hereof), on or before March 1, 2004, provided, however, that if on

Sellers are using their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of the

                  10.03    Bulk Sales Act. To the extent applicable, the parties

                  10.04    Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Operative

agreements prior to the date hereof between the parties with respect to the

rule, provided that any such required disclosure shall only be made, to the
extent consistent with Law, after consultation with the other parties hereto;
provided, however, further that this Section 10.06 shall not apply to any

                  10.07    Confidentiality. Any information or material obtained
by Purchaser or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement (including
Sellers' Disclosure Schedule) that constitutes "Evaluation Material" (as defined
in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Any information or material obtained by Sellers or
their Representatives pursuant to this Agreement regarding Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates shall be treated as confidential by Sellers and their
Representatives in the same manner as Evaluation Material under the
Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that Sellers shall have the right
to file Sellers' Disclosure Schedule with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court under seal.
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere contained, and
without limitation of any kind, Sellers and Purchaser and their respective
Representatives may disclose to any and all Persons (a) the U.S. tax treatment
and U.S. tax structure (as defined in Regs. ss.ss. 1.6011-4(c)(8) and (9)) of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) all materials of
any kind (including opinions and tax analyses) that are provided to any such
party relating to such U.S. tax treatment and U.S. tax structure.

                  10.08    Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may
be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but
no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver
by any party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All remedies,
either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative
and not alternative.

                  10.09    Amendment. This Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or modified only by a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of each party hereto.

                  10.10    No Third Party Beneficiary. The terms and provisions
of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and
their respective successors or permitted assigns, including post-confirmation
trusts, disbursing agents or other agents or professionals of the Estates, and
it is not the intention of the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights
upon any other Person.

                  10.11    No Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement
nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
attempt to do so will be void, provided, however, that Purchaser may assign,
transfer and/or delegate all or any portion of its rights, duties and
obligations under this Agreement (including any Assumed Liabilities and rights
with respect to any Transferred Assets, but not including its obligation to pay
or cause to be paid the Total Purchase Price and any amount required to be paid
by it pursuant to Section 8.02(d)) to any Affiliate(s) of Purchaser. In the
event of any such assignment, transfer or delegation to one or more Affiliates
of Purchaser, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein (but
subject to the further provisions of this Section 10.11), (a) Purchaser shall
have no liability or obligation (whether arising by contract, this Agreement,
tort or otherwise) for any such assigned, transferred or delegated rights,
duties and obligations, and (b) each Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser
and such Affiliate(s) in documenting, executing and effecting the valid

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

assignment, transfer and/or delegation of those rights, duties or obligations
from the respective Seller directly to such Affiliate(s); provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall remain liable to Sellers
under this Agreement for any such assigned, transferred or delegated duties or
obligations to the extent such duties or obligations relate to Assumed
Liabilities under (1) Section 1.02(a)(ii), (2) Section 1.02(a)(iii), (3) Section
1.02(a)(iv) relating solely to retail customer purchase contracts or (4)
Business Contracts listed under "Vendor Contracts" on Section 1.01(a)(vii) of
Sellers' Disclosure Schedule, unless, with respect to any such assigned,
transferred or delegated duties or obligations: (x) Sellers shall have given
their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
to the assignment, transfer or delegation; or (y) Purchaser shall have (i) put
funds into escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement reasonably satisfactory to
Sellers or (ii) obtained a surety bond or letter of credit in favor of Sellers,
in each case in an amount mutually agreed by Sellers and Purchaser to be
sufficient to pay in full any such assigned, transferred or delegated duties and
obligations. Subject to any required approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, this
Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, including
post-confirmation trusts, disbursing agents or other agents or professionals of
the Estates.

                  10.12    Headings. The headings used in this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the
provisions hereof.

                  10.13    Retention of U.S. Bankruptcy Court Jurisdiction.
Subject to the proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence, and except as
otherwise provided herein, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction
of the proceedings referred to in the Plan, including for purposes of
determining any and all controversies and disputes arising under or in
connection with, or for purposes of interpreting the provisions of, this
Agreement and the Operative Agreement and including to the full extent set forth
in the Plan and the Confirmation Order. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, such jurisdiction shall include any determination as to the
fulfillment or non-fulfillment of any condition to consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Articles VI and VII and any such
determination shall be final and binding on the parties and not subject to any
appeal, the right to which is hereby waived by the parties; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall limit the rights of the parties to appeal
any determination of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court relating to the amount of any
monetary damages, fees, costs and expenses awarded with respect to any such
determination as aforesaid.

                  10.14    Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
a contract executed and performed in such State, without giving effect to the
conflicts of laws principles thereof, and, to the extent applicable, the federal
Laws of the United States of America.

                  10.15    Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or
future Law, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this
Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such
provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part hereof, and (c) the

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by
its severance herefrom.

                  10.16    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts and by facsimile signatures, each of which shall be deemed
to be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

provided that the Escrow Agent may retain amounts necessary to pay the Escrow
Agent the amounts contemplated by Section 4(e).

                  3.       Statements; Interest. The Escrow Agent agrees to
maintain account statements with respect to the Escrow Account setting forth
account balance, interest earned on the Escrow Funds and all other activity with
respect to the Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent from time to time shall promptly
provide Sellers and Purchaser with a copy of an account statement for the Escrow
Account upon their reasonable request. All interest proceeds earned on the
Escrow Funds shall be paid to Sellers and Purchaser on a pro-rata basis based on
the proportionate amount of the Escrow Funds to which Sellers and Purchaser are
entitled, if any, under the terms of this Agreement.

                  4.       Rights and Limitations upon Duties of Escrow Agent.

                           (a)      The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible
for the identity, authority or rights of any person, firm or corporation
executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or
any document or instrument deposited hereunder or any endorsement thereon or
assignment thereof.

                           (b)      The Escrow Agent acts hereunder as a
depository only and shall not be responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever
for the genuineness, sufficiency, correctness, or validity of any agreement,
document, certificate, instrument, or item deposited with it or any notice,
consent, approval, direction, or instruction given to it, and the Escrow Agent
shall be fully protected hereunder for all acts taken in accordance with any
written instruction, final order or judgment or instrument given to it
hereunder, and reasonably believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine and what it
purports to be.

                           (c)      It is understood and agreed that the duties
of the Escrow Agent hereunder are purely ministerial in nature and that the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, fact, or law, or any
act done or omitted to be done, except for its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence or that of its partners, employees, and agents. The Escrow Agent's
determination as to whether an event or condition has occurred, or been met or
satisfied, or as to whether a provision of this Agreement has been complied
with, or as to whether sufficient evidence of the event or condition or
compliance with the provision has been furnished to it, shall not subject the
Escrow Agent to any claim, liability, or obligation whatsoever, even if it shall
be found that such determination was improper and incorrect; provided that the
Escrow Agent and its partners, employees, and agents shall not have been guilty
of willful misconduct or gross negligence in making such determination.

                           (d)      In the event any property held by the Escrow
Agent hereunder shall be attached, garnished or levied upon under any court
order, or if the delivery of such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any
court order, or if any court order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered
affecting such property or affecting any act by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent may, in its sole discretion, obey and comply with all writs, orders,
judgments or decrees so entered or issued notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary. If the Escrow Agent obeys and complies with any such
writs, orders, judgments or decrees, it shall not be liable to any of the
parties hereto or to any other person, firm, corporation or other entity, by
reason of such compliance, notwithstanding that such writs, orders, judgments or
decrees may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

                           (e)      The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
receive its normal fees as compensation for its services hereunder as set forth
on Schedule A attached hereto. The Escrow Agent's fees, costs and expenses shall
be borne one-half by Sellers and one-half by Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers and Purchaser jointly and severally agree to pay the
compensation of the Escrow Agent, and shall reimburse the Escrow Agent for any
and all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances made by it in the
performance of its duties hereunder, including reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements incurred by it. Upon receipt by Sellers and Purchaser of the
Escrow Agent's written notice itemizing such costs and expenses, the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to the payment thereof within ten (10) days after

                                       3
<PAGE>

such written notice is given and Sellers and Purchaser hereby authorize the
Escrow Agent to pay such amounts to itself from the amounts held in the Escrow
Account; provided that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to payment of its
first year's Annual Administration Fee upon the deposit of the Escrow Funds with
the Escrow Agent.

                           (f)      Sellers and Purchaser jointly and severally
agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability, or expense (collectively, "Costs") incurred, except to the
extent of those Costs attributable to gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of the Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with its entering
into this Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder, including costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability in connection
herewith or therewith. The right to indemnification set forth in the preceding
sentence shall include the right to be paid by Sellers and Purchaser in respect
of Costs as they are incurred (including Costs incurred in connection with
defending itself against any claim of liability in connection herewith).

                           (g)      The Escrow Agent shall not be required to
take any action under this Agreement if the Escrow Agent shall reasonably
determine, or shall have been advised by counsel, that such action is likely to
result in personal liability, or is contrary to the terms hereof, or otherwise
contrary to law.

                           (h)      If at any time the Escrow Agent shall
receive conflicting notices, claims, demands, or instructions with respect to
the Escrow Account, or if for any other reason it shall in good faith be unable
to determine the party or parties entitled to receive any of the Escrow Funds,
or any part thereof, the Escrow Agent may refuse to make any distribution or
payment and may retain the Escrow Funds in its possession until it shall have
received instructions in writing concurred to by all parties in interest, or
until directed by a final order or judgment of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court from
which no appeal is or can be taken, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall make such
disposition in accordance with such instructions or such order. Alternatively,
the Escrow Agent may deposit all or any part of the Escrow Funds with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for disposition in accordance with further order(s) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, in which event the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any
further obligations hereunder.

                           (i)      The Escrow Agent may consult with, and
obtain advice from, legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to
the construction of any of the provisions hereof or its duties hereunder, and it
shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected and indemnified under
Sections 4(c) and 4(f) above for all acts taken, in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct, in accordance with the opinion and
instructions of such counsel, and the costs of such counsel shall be subject to
reimbursement under Section 4(f) and the notice requirement under Section 4(e).

                           (j)      The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon
giving the other parties hereto thirty (30) days notice to that effect. In that
event the successor escrow agent shall be such person, firm, corporation or
other entity as Sellers and Purchaser shall mutually select. It is understood
and agreed that the Escrow Agent's resignation shall not be effective until a
successor escrow agent agrees to act hereunder; provided, however, that in the
event no successor escrow agent is appointed and acting hereunder within thirty
(30) days of such notice,

                                       4
<PAGE>

the Escrow Agent may pay and deliver the Escrow Funds into the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court; and provided, further, that the Escrow Agent may appoint a successor
escrow agent hereunder at any time so long as such successor shall accept and
agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (except that any such successor
escrow agent shall be entitled to customary fees payable as provided herein) and
shall be a bank or trust company insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, authorized to do business in the State of Delaware.

                           (k)      No person, firm, corporation or other entity
will be recognized by the Escrow Agent as a successor or assignee of Sellers and
Purchaser until there shall be presented to the Escrow Agent evidence
satisfactory to it of such succession or assignment.

                  5.       Interpleader Action. In the event of any disagreement
between Sellers and Purchaser about the interpretation of this Agreement, or
about the rights and obligations or the propriety of any action contemplated by
the Escrow Agent hereunder or upon the resignation of the Escrow Agent and the
failure of the parties hereto to timely engage a successor, the Escrow Agent
may, at its sole discretion, file an action or bill in interpleader in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to determine the rights of the parties hereto and deposit the
balance of the Escrow Account with such court. The Escrow Agent shall be
indemnified by the parties hereto, jointly and severally, for all costs,
including reasonable attorney's fees, in connection with the aforesaid
interpleader action.

                  6.       Term.

                           (a)      This Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the disbursement of all of the Escrow Funds from the Escrow
Account.

                           (b)      If at any time the Escrow Agent shall
receive a joint written notice signed by or on behalf of Sellers and Purchaser
that this Agreement has been terminated and instructing the Escrow Agent with
respect to the disposition of the Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall
disburse the balance of the Escrow Account in accordance with the instructions
contained in such notice, and upon such disbursement this Agreement shall be
deemed terminated, and the Escrow Agent shall be released and discharged from
all further obligations hereunder.

                           (c)      Section 4(f) hereof shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

                  7.       Miscellaneous.

                           (a)      If one or more of the provisions contained
herein shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provisions hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

                           (b)      No waiver of any provisions of this
Agreement nor waiver of any breach or default under this Agreement shall be
considered valid unless in writing and signed by the party giving such waiver,
and no such waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision or any
subsequent breach or default of a similar nature.

respective successors and assigns, including post-confirmation trusts,
disbursing agents or other agents or professionals of the Estates, and it is not
the intention of the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any
other Person.

                OAKWOOD HOMES CORPORATION SALE BIDDING PROCEDURES
                -------------------------------------------------

                  Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "Bidding
Procedures") to be employed with respect to the sale of substantially all of
Seller's (as hereinafter defined) assets (the "Sale") pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement by and between Oakwood Homes Corporation and its affiliated
sellers under the APA (collectively, the "Seller") and Clayton Homes, Inc. (the
"Purchaser"), dated November 24, 2003 (including all exhibits and agreements
attached thereto, the "Agreement"1), or such other sale of such assets to a
Qualified Bidder (as hereinafter defined) as may result from the Auction (as
hereinafter defined) contemplated hereby (an "Alternative Transaction") pursuant
to the Seller's to-be-filed joint consolidated plan of reorganization (as may be
amended, the "Plan").

                  Notwithstanding the selection of the Successful Bidder (as
hereinafter defined), and the execution of the Agreement (or the Marked
Agreement (as hereinafter defined)), as the case may be, the consummation of the
Sale or an Alternative Transaction provided for therein shall be contingent
upon, and made pursuant to, confirmation and the effectiveness of the Plan. If
no other Qualified Bid (as defined below) is received pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in these Bidding Procedures, then the Seller may close the
Sale with the Purchaser; provided, however, that if another Qualified Bid is
received by the Seller, then the Seller may close an Alternative Transaction
with such Qualified Bidder (as hereinafter defined) determined to have made the
highest or otherwise best offer in the Auction (as hereinafter defined)
consistent with these Bidding Procedures (the "Successful Bidder").

                           PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS
                           --------------------------

                  To Participate in the Bidding Process, each interested person
(a "Potential Bidder") must deliver the following to the Seller's Investment
Banker (as hereinafter defined), with a copy to the Committee's Financial
Advisors (as hereinafter defined), no later than 12:00 noon (Wilmington,
Delaware time) on the fifth business day after entry of the order approving
these Bidding Procedures or such other time as may be agreed by the Committee or
the Debtors:

                  (i)      An executed confidentiality agreement in form and
                           substance reasonably satisfactory to the Seller,
                           which is no less favorable to Seller than the
                           confidentiality agreement (together with all
                           amendments thereto) executed by the Purchaser; and

-------------------
1    Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms shall have the
     meanings set forth in the Agreement.


<PAGE>

                  (ii)     The most current audited and latest unaudited
                           financial statements (collectively, the "Financials")
                           of the Potential Bidder, or, if the Potential Bidder
                           does not have audited financial statements or is an
                           entity formed for the purpose of the Transaction, (x)
                           Financials of the equity holder(s) of the Potential
                           Bidder or such other form of financial disclosure
                           reasonably acceptable to the Seller or its legal and
                           financial advisors, or the Committee and its legal
                           and financial advisors and (y) the written commitment
                           of the equity holder(s) of the Potential Bidder to be
                           responsible for the Potential Bidder's obligations in
                           connection with the Transaction.

                  A "Qualified Bidder" is a Potential Bidder that delivers the
documents described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, whose Financials
demonstrate, in the opinion of the Seller and its legal and financial advisors,
or the Committee and its legal and financial advisors, (x) the financial
capability to consummate an Alternative Transaction, and (y) the ability to
consummate an Alternative Transaction if selected as a Successful Bidder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Purchaser is a Qualified
Bidder.

                  Within two (2) business days after Seller's Investment Banker
receives from a Potential Bidder all of the materials required by subparagraphs
(i) and (ii) above, the Seller or the Committee shall determine, and Seller's
Investment Banker shall notify the Potential Bidder in writing, whether the
Potential Bidder is a Qualified Bidder. If the Potential Bidder is a Qualified
Bidder, at the same time that the Seller notifies the Potential Bidder that it
is a Qualified Bidder, the Seller shall deliver to the Qualified Bidder a copy
of the confidential investment memorandum prepared by Seller's Investment Banker
and the Agreement.

                  After the determination by the Seller or the Committee whether
any person is a Qualified Bidder, the Seller shall (i) coordinate the efforts of
Qualified Bidders in conducting their respective due diligence investigations
regarding the Seller in accordance with these Bidding Procedures, (ii) receive
bids from Qualified Bidders, and (iii) negotiate any bid made to purchase the
Seller (collectively, the "Bidding Process"). Any person who wishes to
participate in the Bidding Process must be a Qualified Bidder as set forth
below. Neither the Seller nor any of its affiliates (nor any of their respective
representatives) shall furnish any nonpublic information of any kind whatsoever
relating to the Seller to any person who is not a Qualified Bidder.

                         OBTAINING DUE DILIGENCE ACCESS
                         ------------------------------

                  To obtain due diligence access or additional information from
the Seller, a Qualified Bidder (other than Purchaser) must first provide the
Seller's Investment Banker (with a copy simultaneously delivered to the
Committee's Financial Advisors) with a written non-binding expression of
interest ("Expression of Interest") regarding (i) the Transaction, (ii) the
purchase price range, (iii) the structure and financing of the transaction
(including, if applicable, the amount of equity to be committed and sources of
financing), (iv) any conditions to closing, and (v) the nature and extent of
additional due diligence it may wish to conduct. If, based on the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

Expression of Interest and such additional factors as the Seller determines
(after consultation with the Committee) are relevant, the Seller, in its
business judgment, determines that the Qualified Bidder is reasonably likely to
make a bona fide higher or otherwise better offer for the Seller's assets than
offered by the Purchaser, the Seller shall, after consultation with the
Committee, afford such Qualified Bidder reasonable due diligence.

                  Neither the Seller nor any of its affiliates (or any of their
respective representatives) shall furnish any nonpublic information relating to
the Seller to any person except to the Purchaser or a Qualified Bidder who makes
an acceptable Expression of Interest. Seller shall give the Purchaser access to
all due diligence information provided to any other Qualified Bidder at the same
time as, or immediately after, it is given.

                  The Seller shall coordinate all reasonable requests for
additional information and due diligence access from Qualified Bidders. No
conditions relating to the completion of due diligence shall be permitted to
exist after the Bid Deadline (as hereinafter defined).

                           DUE DILIGENCE FROM BIDDERS
                           --------------------------

                  Seller's Investment Banker and the Committee's Financial
Advisors shall be entitled to due diligence from the Qualified Bidder (other
than Purchaser), upon execution of a reasonable confidentiality agreement. The
Qualified Bidder shall comply with all reasonable requests for additional
information and due diligence access by the Seller's Investment Banker and the
Committee's Financial Advisors. Failure by the Qualified Bidder (other than
Purchaser) to fully and promptly comply with requests for additional information
and due diligence will be a basis for Seller, after consultation with the
Committee, to determine that the limited bid as well as any subsequent bid made
by the Qualified Bidder is not a Qualified Bid.

                                BID REQUIREMENTS
                                ----------------

                  A bid must be a written irrevocable offer from a Qualified
Bidder (i) stating that the Qualified Bidder offers to consummate the
Transaction as contemplated by the Agreement, upon the terms and conditions
(other than the Break-Up Fee) set forth in a copy of the Agreement, marked to
show those amendments and modifications to the Agreement, including price and
terms, that the Qualified Bidder proposes (and which are in form and substance
acceptable to the Seller after consultation with the Committee, the "Marked
Agreement"); (ii) enclosing a copy of the proposed Marked Agreement; and (iii)
accompanied with (a) a certified or bank check, or wire transfer, in the amount
of fourteen million dollars ($14,000,000) payable to the order of the Seller as
a good-faith deposit (the "Good Faith Deposit"), and (b) written evidence of a
commitment for financing or other evidence of ability to consummate the
transaction, subject to no conditions other than those set forth in the Marked
Agreement, in either event satisfactory to the Seller in consultation with its
financial and legal advisors and the Committee.

                  In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Seller, after
consultation with the Committee, will consider a bid only if the bid:

                  a.       provides for an aggregate purchase price of at least
                           three million dollars ($3,000,000) over the sum of
                           (x) the aggregate purchase price offered by

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

                           the Purchaser in the Agreement (which shall be
                           evaluated based, among other things, on all relevant
                           information, including the cash purchase price, and
                           working capital adjustment and assumption of all
                           liabilities set forth in the Marked Agreement,
                           without regard to the Break-Up Fee), and (y) the
                           Break-Up Fee;

                  b.       provides that all cash and securities (other than
                           equity securities) which are components of the
                           purchase price are denominated in U.S. Dollars only;

                  c.       is not conditioned on the outcome of unperformed due
                           diligence by the bidder with respect to the Seller;

                  d.       does not request or entitle the bidder to a break-up
                           fee, an expense reimbursement or any similar type of
                           payment; and

                  e.       fully discloses the identity of each entity that will
                           be bidding for the Seller or otherwise participating
                           in connection with such bid, and the complete terms
                           of any such participation.

                  A bid received from a Qualified Bidder that meets the
requirements set forth in the preceding two paragraphs will be considered a
"Qualified Bid." For purposes hereof, the Agreement executed by the Purchaser
shall constitute a Qualified Bid, but under no circumstances will Purchaser be
required to make a Good Faith Deposit. Nothing in these Bidding Procedures will
be deemed to amend Purchaser's rights under the Agreement.

                                  BID DEADLINE

AUCTION SHALL TAKE PLACE AT 10:00 A.M. (WILMINGTON, DELAWARE TIME) ON (i)
JANUARY 9, 2004, IF THE BID PROCEDURES HEARING IS ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 11,
2003; OR (ii) JANUARY 14, 2004, IF THE BID PROCEDURES HEARING IS AFTER DECEMBER
11, 2003, AT THE OFFICES OF MORRIS NICHOLS ARSHT & TUNNELL, 1201 NORTH MARKET
STREET, WILMINGTON, DELAWARE or such later time or other place as the Seller
shall notify all Qualified Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids. Only a
Qualified Bidder who has submitted a Qualified Bid will be eligible to
participate at the Auction. Only the authorized representatives of each of the
Qualified Bidders, the Committee, the Purchaser and the Seller shall be
permitted to attend the Auction. At the Auction, Qualified Bidders will be
permitted to increase their bids. The bidding at the Auction shall start at the
purchase price stated in the highest or otherwise best Qualified Bid, as
determined by the Seller, after consultation with legal and financial advisors
and the Committee, and as disclosed to all Qualified Bidders prior to the
commencement of the Auction, and continue in increments of at least one million
dollars ($1,000,000).

                  Immediately prior to the conclusion of the Auction, the
Seller, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors and the Committee,
shall (i) review each Qualified Bid on the basis of its financial and
contractual terms and the factors relevant to the sale process and the best
interests of the Seller's estates, including, without limitation, those factors
affecting the speed and certainty of consummating the Sale, the adequacy of the
consideration offered (including liquidity of any equity component), finance and
other contingencies, and antitrust and competition law considerations, and (ii)
identify the highest or otherwise best offer (based upon all relevant
information) for the Transaction (the "Successful Bid").

                          ACCEPTANCE OF SUCCESSFUL BID
                          ----------------------------

                  The Seller presently intends to enter into a Transaction with
the Successful Bidder, whether such entity is the Purchaser or another Qualified
Bidder. Pursuant to the order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the Bidding
Procedures (the "Bidding Procedures Order"), the Agreement or Marked Agreement
shall constitute a binding contract of Seller only to the extent that
performance is called for before the closing under such agreement. The Seller
intends to present the results of the Auction and the Agreement or the Marked
Agreement, as the case may be, to the Bankruptcy Court at a hearing (the
"Approval Hearing"), at which the Seller will request that the Bankruptcy Court
(i) confirm the results of the Auction, including that the Auction complied with
the Bidding Procedures and the Bidding Procedures Order, and (ii) approve the
selection of the Successful Bid and the Successful Bidder, as the highest or
otherwise best offer for the Seller. The Approval Hearing shall be held no
earlier than five

                                      -6-

business days after the Auction, but in no event later than January 25, 2004
(Wilmington, Delaware time).

                  However, neither (a) the Seller's inclusion of the Successful
Bid in the Plan or Disclosure Statement or presentation of the Successful Bid
and the Agreement or Marked Agreement, as applicable, at an Approval Hearing,
nor (b) the entry of an order approving the Disclosure Statement (or any other
order approving the Agreement or the Marked Agreement before confirmation of the
Plan) by the applicable Court, shall obligate the Seller to consummate the
Transaction. The Seller will be obligated to consummate the Transaction and the
Bankruptcy Court will have approved the Transaction only when the Plan, as
amended to give effect to the Successful Bid, has been confirmed and the
effective date thereof occurs.

                    INCORPORATION OF SUCCESSFUL BID INTO PLAN
                    -----------------------------------------

                  The terms of the Successful Bid shall be incorporated into the
Plan, which, together with the Disclosure Statement shall be amended to the
extent required to give effect thereto. The closing of the Sale shall be
contingent upon confirmation of the Plan and the occurrence of the effective
date of the Plan

             RETURN OF GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT; QUALIFIED BIDS STAY OPEN
             ------------------------------------------------------

                  Pending the entry of the Approval Order, all Good Faith
Deposits shall be maintained by the Seller in one or more interest-bearing
escrow accounts. All Qualified Bids (except any bids made by Purchaser) must
remain open, until the eleventh day after entry of the Approval Order or the
next business day thereafter. Pending such date, all Good Faith Deposits shall
be maintained by the Seller in one or more interest-bearing escrow accounts and
shall be returned to unsuccessful bidders on the eleventh day (or the next
business day thereafter) after entry of the Approval Order with any accrued
interest.

                                OTHER PROVISIONS
                                ----------------

                  The Seller may, after consultation with the Committee, (i)
determine, in its business judgment, which Qualified Bid, if any, is the
Successful Bid; and (ii) reject at any time before entry of the Approval Order,
any bid that, the Seller determines, is (a) inadequate or insufficient, (b) not
in conformity with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding
Procedures, or the terms and conditions of Sale, or (c) contrary to the best
interest of the Seller and its estates. In the event that the Committee or any
other party in interest disagrees with the manner in which the Seller conducted
the Bidding Process or the selection of the Successful Bid, it may assert its
objection at the Approval Hearing. The Seller, after consultation with the
Committee, shall have the right to adopt such other rules for the Bidding
Process which, in its sole judgment, will better promote the goals of the
Bidding Process and which are not inconsistent with any of the provisions of
these Bidding Procedures. At the Auction, after consultation with the Committee,
the Seller may announce any such additional procedural rules for conducting the
Auction.

</TABLE>

Please note that this list is limited to single tax claims over $50,000.00,
exclusive of penalties and interest.

In addition to the above claims, Oakwood estimates that it owes approximately
$801,074.95 in property taxes to numerous jurisdictions. These taxes,
individually, would not be "material," however due to the large aggregate
liability, Oakwood discloses these liabilities here. Additional information
about these property taxes is available upon request.
