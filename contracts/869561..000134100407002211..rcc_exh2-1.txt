     Common Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such
     Company Stock Option.

                   (ii) Each stock appreciation right with respect to Company
     Common Stock, including those issued under the Company Stock Plans, whether
     or not vested, and whether or not performance-based, which is outstanding
     at the Effective Time (each, a "Company SAR"), shall be cancelled and
     converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive payment of an
     amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
     Common Stock for which such Company SAR (regardless of whether or not any
     such Company SAR is then vested or exercisable) shall not theretofore have
     been exercised and (y) the excess, if any, of the Common Merger
     Consideration over the grant price per share of such Company SAR.

                   (iii) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
     contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or
     benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common

     based on, shares of Company Common Stock (including restricted stock,
     restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares and other
     stock-based awards, other than Company Stock Options and Company SARs
     (each, a "Company Stock-Based Award")) that is outstanding immediately
     prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and shall be

     accordance with Section 3.1(b).

                   (iv) As soon as practicable following the date of this
     Agreement, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board") (or, if

     adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
     provide that with respect to the ESPP, (x) the then-offering period shall
     end on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time
     occurs, (y) each participant's outstanding right to purchase shares of
     Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately
     prior to such date; provided that all amounts allocated to each
     participant's account under the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be
     used to purchase whole shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable
     price determined under the terms of the ESPP using such date as the final
     purchase date for such offering period and (z) the ESPP shall terminate
     immediately following such purchases of Company Common Stock.

                   (v) All amounts payable to holders of Company Stock Options,

<PAGE>

               (e) Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

               (f) Redemption of Exchangeable Preferred Stock. The Exchangeable
Preferred Stock shall, if requested by Parent, be called for redemption at the
Effective Time in accordance with Section .

         3.2   Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

               (a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall
deliver or cause to be delivered, in trust, to a bank or trust company
designated before the Closing Date by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Paying Agent") pursuant to a paying agent agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be exchanged or paid in
accordance with this ARTICLE III, to be held for the benefit of and distributed
to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Class M Preferred Stock
(other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(a))
(collectively, the "Shares") in accordance with this Section 3.2. The Paying
Agent shall agree to hold such funds (such funds, together with earnings
thereon, being referred to herein as the "Consideration Fund") for delivery as
contemplated by this Section 3.2 and upon such additional terms as may be agreed
upon by the Paying Agent.

               (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") and to each holder of
record of Shares not represented by a certificate ("Book-Entry Shares") whose
Shares are converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE III,
and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled as of the Effective Time. In no event shall the holder of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share be entitled to receive interest on any funds to
be received in the

                                       6
<PAGE>

Merger. The amount of any payment to a person in respect of Merger Consideration
shall be rounded to the nearest $.01. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares which is not registered in the transfer of records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

               (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented thereby.
From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section
3.2.

               (d) Investment of Consideration Fund. The Consideration Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation; provided, however, that any such investments shall be in (i)
securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the government
of the United States of America ("U.S.") or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and having maturities of not more than one month from the date of
investment or (ii) money market mutual or similar funds having assets in excess
of $1,000,000,000. Earnings on or constituting all or a portion of the
Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as Parent directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required
by this ARTICLE III, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
the holders of Shares at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.

               (e) Tax Withholding. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Holdings
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration (and any other amounts payable in accordance with this
Agreement) otherwise payable to any holder of Shares such amounts as the Paying
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
U.S. federal, state or local tax law or any other non-U.S. tax law or any other
applicable legal requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such amounts withheld from
the Merger Consideration (or from any other amounts payable in accordance with
this Agreement) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid.

               (f) Termination of Consideration Fund. Any portion of the
Consideration Fund which remains undistributed to the shareholders of the
Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand,

                                      7
<PAGE>

and any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) as general creditors for
payment of their claim for any Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws.

               (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent
or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

         3.3   Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has filed with
the corporation a written notice of intent to demand the fair value of the
Shares owned by the holder in accordance with sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of
the MBCA ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1, unless and until such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to
dissent and demand payment under the MBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his or her right to demand
payment, then such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without interest or
dividends thereon, and such Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
for payment of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company
with respect to shareholders' appraisal rights, and, prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

         3.4   No Further Rights or Transfers. Except for the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to each Share or the perfection of
dissenters' rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares, at and after the
Effective Time, the holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights as a
shareholder of the Company.

         4.6   Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

               (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as required by the Exchange Act
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as required by the
Exchange Act to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Section 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date
hereof, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's board
of directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting. The Company's management has completed an assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting
in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 for the year ended December 31, 2006, and such assessment concluded that
such controls were effective.

               (b) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the
applicable listing and governance rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock

are collectively referred to as the "Company Material Contracts" and is each a
"Company Material Contract".

         4.15  Proxy Statement. None of the information (a) supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or (b) incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, on the date mailed to the shareholders
of the Company, at the time of the Special Meeting, or at the time of any
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading except, in each case,
that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent, Holdings or Merger
Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

         4.16  Company Rights Plans. The Company has amended, and the Company
and the Board have taken all necessary action to amend, the Class A Rights Plan
and the Class B Rights Plan (together, the "Rights Agreements") to render the
Class A Rights and the Class B Rights (together, the "Rights") inapplicable to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
and to ensure that none of the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger will result in (a) the occurrence of an event
described in Section 3(a) of the Rights Agreements, (b) a Distribution Date (as
defined in the Class A Rights Plan or the Class B Rights Plan) or (c) the Rights
becoming evidenced by, and

                                       22
<PAGE>

transferable pursuant to, certificates separate from the certificates
representing the Company Common Stock. No Distribution Date has occurred, and
the Rights have not become evidenced by, or transferable pursuant to,
certificates separate from the certificates representing the Company Common
Stock. The Company and the Board have taken all actions necessary to make the
Class A Rights and Class B Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. A true and correct copy of each such
amendments to the Rights Agreements and the action of the Board approving such
amendments has been provided to Parent on or prior to the date hereof, and such
amendments remain in full force and effect.

         4.17  Takeover Statutes. The Board and/or a committee of disinterested
directors thereof pursuant to section 302A.673, as applicable, have duly and
validly taken all corporate action to render the provisions of section 302A.673
of the MBCA restricting business combinations with "interested shareholders"
inapplicable to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Section
302A.671 of the MBCA applicable to "control share acquisitions" will not
prohibit the authorization, execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
or consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
authorization, execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby does not, and
any formation of a "group" for purposes of section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act
in connection with this Agreement will not, result in a "control share
acquisition" as defined in section 302A.011 of the MBCA or a "takeover offer"
within the meaning of Section 80B.subd.8 of Minnesota Statues. Assuming the
accuracy of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 5.8, no "fair
price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "takeover offer" or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (each a "Takeover Statute"), is
applicable to the Company, shares of the Company's capital stock, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company makes no representation or
warranty concerning the applicability of any Takeover Statute other than those
Takeover Statutes existing under the MBCA and Section 80B.

         4.18  Brokers and Finders. Except for the fees and expenses payable to
Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Falkenberg Capital Corporation, which fees and
expenses are reflected in their respective agreements with the Company, true and
complete copies of which have been made available to Parent, the Company has not
employed any investment banker, broker, finder, consultant or intermediary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby which would be entitled to
any investment banking, brokerage, finder's or similar fee or commission in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

         4.19  Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received the
opinion of Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., dated as of the date hereof, to the effect
that, as of such date, the consideration to be received by the holders of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is fair to the holders of Class A
Common Stock and to the holders of Class B Common Stock from a financial point
of view. A true and complete executed copy of such opinion has been delivered to
Parent.

         4.20  Interested Party Transactions. Except for employment agreements
set forth in Section 4.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or filed or
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to a Company SEC Report filed prior to
the date hereof or Company Benefit Plans,

                                       23
<PAGE>

there are no Contracts under which there are any existing or future liabilities
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and, on the
other hand, any (i) present officer or director of either the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any person that has served as such an officer or director
within the past two years or any of such officer's or director's immediate
family members, other than regular directors' fees, (ii) record or beneficial
owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's capital stock as of the date

         4.21  No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this ARTICLE IV and in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.3(c), neither the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries nor any other person acting on behalf of the Company or any
such Subsidiary makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT, HOLDINGS AND MERGER SUB
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

         Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent,
Holdings and Merger Sub (in the case of Merger Sub, from and after its
incorporation as contemplated by Section 6.12) represents and warrants to the
Company as set forth below.

         5.1 Corporate Organization and Qualification. Each of Parent, Holdings
and Merger Sub is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its respective
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and is qualified and in good
standing as a foreign corporation, partnership or other entity in each
jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or operated or the business
conducted by it require such qualification, except where failure to so qualify
or be in good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub has all requisite power and authority
(corporate or otherwise) to own its properties and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted except where failure to have such power and authority
has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

available to the Company complete and correct copies of the articles of
incorporation or other equivalent organizational documents and bylaws of Parent,
Holdings and Merger Sub.

         5.2   Authority Relative to this Agreement.

               (a) Each of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub has the requisite
corporate or other power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement and the

action of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub and no other proceedings

                                       24
<PAGE>

on the part of Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent, Holdings and
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of each of
Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent, Holdings
and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability may
be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally
and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

               (b) Each of Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub has duly and validly
approved and taken all corporate or other action required to be taken by Parent,
Holdings or Merger Sub for the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         5.3   Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Neither the execution,
delivery and performance by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub of this Agreement,
nor the consummation by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will:

respective articles of incorporation or other equivalent organizational
documents and bylaws of Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub;

including the Communications Act, (F) such filings or consents as may be
required by local and state Governmental Entities pursuant to any Utilities
Laws, (G) as may be required by any applicable state securities or "blue sky"
laws, (H) where the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or
permit, or to make such filing or notification, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (I) such filings,
consents, approvals, orders, registrations and declarations as may be required
as a result of the status or identity of the Company;

               (c) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration, loss of any
material benefit or any lien or other charge or encumbrance) under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, license, concession, Contract,
right or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their assets may be bound or affected, except for such violations, breaches and
defaults (or give rise to any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or

                                       25

other charge or encumbrance) which have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; or

               (d) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or permits
and filings or notifications referred to in this Section 5.3 are duly and timely
obtained or made, violate any Order applicable to Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub
or to any of their respective assets, except for violations which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         5.4   Available Funds. Immediately prior to and at the Effective Time,
Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub will have available all of the funds necessary
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         5.5   Proxy Statement. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied in writing by Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, on the date mailed to
the shareholders of the Company, at the time of the Special Meeting, and at the
time of any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading except, in each
case, that no representation or warranty is made by Parent, Holdings or Merger

incorporation by reference therein.

date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its controlled affiliates has
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock of the

part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any information to,
any Third Party or Third Parties making such written Competing Proposal and
their respective Representatives and potential sources of financing if the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that (i) the Competing Transaction (A) is reasonably likely

the holders of Shares than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (B) is reasonably capable of being consummated (a "Superior
Proposal") and (ii) the failure to furnish such information or participate in
such discussions or negotiations could be reasonably expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law.

               (b) The Company shall be permitted to provide information to any
Third Party (or any Representative thereof or potential source of financing
therefor) pursuant to the second sentence of Section 6.4(a) only if (i) such
information is provided pursuant to and in accordance with a confidentiality
agreement containing terms and conditions no less restrictive

                                       31
<PAGE>

in any material respect than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
and (ii) all such information provided to such Person has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or concurrently with the
time it is provided to such Person. The Company shall take all action necessary
to enforce its rights under the provisions of any "standstill" agreement between
the Company and a Third Party, and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to
any amendment or modification to any such agreement, to permit such Third Party
to submit a Competing Proposal.

               (c) The Company shall (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
or their Representatives conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Competing Proposal and will request the prompt return or
destruction of any confidential information previously furnished to such Persons
in connection therewith, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to
inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.4.
Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.4 by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4 by the Company.

               (d) As promptly as practicable after the receipt by the Company
or any of its Representatives of any Competing Proposal or any inquiry with
respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Proposal and in any case within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, the Company
shall provide oral and written notice to Parent of (i) such Competing Proposal
or inquiry, (ii) the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal or
inquiry, and (iii) the material terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal
or inquiry (including any amendments or modifications thereto). The Company
shall keep Parent fully informed on as current a basis as is reasonably
practicable of the status of such Competing Proposal or inquiry, including,
without limitation, any changes to the terms and conditions thereof, and
promptly provide Parent with copies of all Competing Proposals (and
modifications thereof) and related term sheets, letters of intent, agreements,
draft agreements and modifications thereof.

               (e) Neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly
or indirectly, (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent
the Company Recommendation or make any statement in connection with the Special
Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation including, without limitation,
approving or recommending any Competing Proposal or failing to recommend the
adoption of this Agreement (any of the foregoing, a "Change of Recommendation")
or (ii) approve any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any
Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal
or an Intervening Event, after having complied with the other provisions of this
Section 6.4(e) and determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, effect a Change of
Recommendation, provided that the Board may not effect a Change of
Recommendation unless (i) the Board shall

                                       32
<PAGE>

have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect
a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the most
current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of an Intervening Event,
attach information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and
(ii) Parent does not make, within five Business Days after the receipt of such
notice, a proposal that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, is at least as
favorable to the holders of the Company Common Stock as such Superior Proposal
or obviates the need for a Change of Recommendation as a result of an
Intervening Event, as the case may be. The Company agrees that, during the five
Business Day period prior to its effecting a Change of Recommendation, the
Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding any Change of
Recommendation, Parent shall have the option, exercisable within five Business
Days after such Change of Recommendation, to cause the Board to submit this
Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of adopting this
Agreement and approving the Merger. If Parent exercises such option, Parent
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(ii).
If Parent fails to exercise such option, the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.4(ii).

               (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company or the Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from
making any disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in each case, the Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that
it is required to do so in order to comply with applicable Law, including its
fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company, provided, however that neither
the Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by
Section 6.4(e), effect a Change of Recommendation or approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal.

         6.5   Reasonable Best Efforts.

               (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby;
(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities or other Persons any actions,
non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or orders
required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) make all necessary registrations and filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
and the Merger required under (A) any applicable federal or state securities
Laws, (B) the HSR Act and any applicable

                                       33
<PAGE>

competition, antitrust or investment Laws of jurisdictions other than the U.S.,
(C) the FCC Rules, including the Communications Act, and (D) any other
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company and Parent will cooperate
with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including
providing copies of all such filings and attachments to the non-filing party;
(iv) furnish all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; (v) keep the other party informed in all material respects
of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby; (vi) permit the other parties
to review any material communication delivered to, and consulting with the other
party in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with any
proceeding by a private party relating thereto, and giving the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences (to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or private party); (vii) avoid the
entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(viii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. No parties to this Agreement shall consent
to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Without limiting this Section 6.5(a), Parent
agrees to take, or to cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make any and
all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, merger control, competition, or trade regulation Law or any other
applicable federal, state or local Law, including the FCC Rules, the
Communications Act and Utilities Laws, or impediment resulting from a PUC that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no
later than the Termination Date) , including proposing, negotiating, committing
to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of
Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company or otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit Parent's or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company, in each case, as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
Closing. Except as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, Parent,
Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action that could reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in ARTICLE
VII not being satisfied as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no
later than the Termination Date).

               (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to
the other of (i) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and (ii) any change or development that is
reasonably likely to have

                                       34
<PAGE>

a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable; provided that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties or covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereunder.

               (c) Except with respect to the matter set forth in Section 7.3(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall not be permitted to agree
to any actions, restrictions or conditions, or make any payment (other than de
minimis administrative fees) with respect to obtaining any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of
Parent in its sole discretion, except for commercially reasonable agreements and
payments in connection with the matter set forth in Section 7.3(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

         6.6 Access to Information. The Company shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) afford to directors, officers, employees, counsel,
investment bankers, accountants and other authorized representatives
("Representatives") of Parent and its affiliates reasonable access, in a manner
not unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties, personnel,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period,
shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such
Representatives all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub if
such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) cause
significant competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, (ii) violate applicable
Law or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or (iii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal
privilege. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.6 for any
competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to this Agreement, other than in connection with
any divestiture or other disposition of assets. Except as otherwise contemplated
hereby, the confidentiality agreement, dated May 24, 2007 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between the Company and Parent shall apply with respect to
information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company's
Representatives hereunder.

         6.7   Publicity. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of
their respective affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any
other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as
may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make
such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before making any such public announcements;
provided that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior

                                       35
<PAGE>

agreement of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or
public announcement if the Board has effected a Change of Recommendation.

         6.8   Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

               (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at any time prior to the
Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its present
or former Subsidiaries or corporate parents (the "Indemnified Parties") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by
Law. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of
expenses set forth in the articles of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws of the Company on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties with respect to events occurring
prior to the Effective Time, unless such modification is required by Law.

               (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company
and the Company's Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any other
employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such insurance
policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Insured Parties") with
respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated hereby) or a "tail" or "run-off" policy providing such
coverage with respect to such matters; provided, however, that (i) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of substantially the
same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the Insured Parties, (ii) in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation
be obligated to expend in order to obtain or maintain insurance coverage
pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) any amount per annum in excess of 200% of the
aggregate premiums currently paid or payable by the Company in 2007 (on an
annualized basis) for such purpose (the "Cap"), which the Company represents and
warrants to be no more than the amount set forth on Section 6.8(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) if equivalent coverage cannot be
obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the
Cap, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain as
much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Cap.

               (c) This Section 6.8 is intended to benefit the Insured Parties
and the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving
Corporation of the indemnification and other

                                       36
<PAGE>

obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8 and the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

               (d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving person of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

               (e) To the extent permitted by Law, all rights of indemnification
and advancement of expenses for the benefit of any Indemnified Party shall be
mandatory rather than permissive.

         6.9   Employees.

               (a) For the benefit of employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent such employee remains employed after the Effective
Time (the "Employees"), for a period of one (1) year following the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to (i) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
each Employee with base salary or wage rates, cash incentive compensation
opportunity and other cash compensation that, in the aggregate, are not less
than those in effect for such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) either (A) maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the
Company Plans (other than any equity-based Company Plan or any Company Plans
which are required to be terminated pursuant to this Agreement) at the benefit
levels in effect on the date hereof or (B) provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide employee benefits (including retirement benefits) that,
in the aggregate, are no less favorable to each Employee than those in effect
for employees of Parent similarly situated to such Employee after the Effective
Time. In determining the total compensation to be provided post-Closing to each
Employee who participated in any equity-based Company Plan other than the ESSP,
but who is not expected to receive equity-based awards under Parent's programs,
during the first year following Closing Parent will cause Surviving Corporation
to evaluate whether any adjustment in other elements of compensation should be
made to reflect such lost participation and Surviving Corporation will make any
such adjustment(s) that Parent and Surviving Corporation determine to be
appropriate.

               (b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be
honored, in accordance with their terms, all incentive, bonus, individual
benefit, employment, employment termination, severance and other compensation
agreements, plans and arrangements, including the Company's change-in-control
agreements and policies and general severance and retention plans, in each case
existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, that are between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former officer,
director or employee thereof or for the benefit of any such current or former
officer, director or employee.

               (c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy
or arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time and in which

                                       37
<PAGE>

any of the Employees participate (the "Parent Plans"), for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate and vesting, service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides
past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent and/or any
applicable Subsidiary of Parent; provided, however, that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods or evidence of insurability requirements. Each Parent Plan shall
waive pre-existing condition limitations for Employees (and their beneficiaries
and covered dependents) participating in such plan to the extent waived or not
applicable under the applicable Company Plan. The Employees shall be given
credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the Effective
Time during the Parent Plan year in which the Effective Time occurs under a
corresponding Company Plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums for such period as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Plan.

               (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9, express or implied:
(i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Company Plan, any
Parent Plan, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement; (ii)
shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or any Subsidiary to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan,
any Parent Plan, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement;
(iii) is intended to confer or shall confer upon any current or former employee
any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason
of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment;
(iv) is intended to confer or shall confer upon any individual or any legal
representative of any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents
or beneficiaries of employees or retirees and including collective bargaining
agents or representatives) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement; or (v) shall be deemed to confer upon any such individual or legal
representative any rights under or with respect to any plan, program or
arrangement described in or contemplated by this Agreement, and each such
individual or legal representative shall be entitled to look only to the express
terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

         6.10  Section 16(b). The Board shall, prior to the Effective Time, take
all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d)
and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt from section 16 of the
Exchange Act the disposition of capital stock of the Company and "derivative
securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act) with respect to
capital stock of the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of section
16(a) of the Exchange Act.

         6.11  Control of the Company's Operations. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct
the operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its
operations.

                                       38
<PAGE>

         6.12  Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation. Parent will take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, (b) cause Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (c) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct
any business, make any investments or incur or guarantee any indebtedness.

         6.13  Compliance with Laws. The Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, operate its business in compliance with all applicable Laws
in all material respects, including all FCC Rules relating to the sunset of the
Cellular Radiotelephone Service Analog Service Requirement and related
requirements, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in full
force and effect and, to the extent applicable, renew, the Company Permits. The
Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any Deployment Requests
that are received by the Company after the date hereof. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to renew, prior to the expiration thereof and for a
period ending not less than 60 days after the Closing Date, each Public Safety
Access Point extension that would otherwise expire between the date hereof and
the Closing Date.

         6.14  Treatment of Certain Notes.

               (a) Subject to Section 6.14(c) hereto, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its respective reasonable best
efforts to commence, promptly after the receipt of a written request from Parent
to do so and the receipt of the Offer Documents from Parent, tender offers to
purchase, and any related consent solicitations with respect to, any
indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Indebtedness") on the terms and conditions specified by Parent in compliance
with all applicable covenants in the existing indentures and certificates of
designation (collectively, the "Debt Offers"), and Parent shall assist the
Company in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of
the Debt Offers shall be conditioned on the completion of the Merger and
otherwise in compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations. The
Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offers.
With respect to any series of Indebtedness, if requested by Parent in writing,
in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer for such series (or in addition thereto), the
Company shall, to the extent permitted by the indenture and officers'
certificates or supplemental indenture governing such series of Indebtedness (i)
issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding principal
amount of Indebtedness of such series pursuant to the requisite provisions of
the indenture and officer's certificate governing such series of Indebtedness or
(ii) take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary
for the satisfaction and/or discharge and/or defeasance of such series pursuant
to the applicable provisions of the indenture and officer's certificate or
supplemental indenture governing such series of Indebtedness, and shall redeem
or satisfy and/or discharge and/or defease, as applicable, such series in
accordance with the terms of the indenture and officer's certificate or
supplemental indenture governing such series of Indebtedness at the Effective
Time, provided that to the extent that any action described in clause (i) or
(ii) can be conditioned on the occurrence of the

                                       39
<PAGE>

Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, and provided, further, that prior to
the Company being required to take any of the actions described in clause (i) or
(ii) above that cannot be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time,
prior to the Closing, Parent shall irrevocably and timely deposit, or shall
cause to be irrevocably and timely deposited with the trustee under the relevant
indenture governing such series of Indebtedness sufficient funds to effect such
redemption or satisfaction or discharge. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that
the Merger shall have been consummated and that there shall be no Law
prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offers) as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in compliance with all applicable covenants in the existing indentures
and certificates of designation and shall not, without the written consent of
Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes to the Debt
Offers other than as reasonably agreed between Parent and the Company.

               (b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the
consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are
received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary
shall (and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the applicable trustee to
execute supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of
Indebtedness for which the requisite consent has been received, which
supplemental indentures shall implement the amendments described in the offer to
purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related documents
(collectively, the "Offer Documents") and shall become operative only
concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offers). Concurrent with
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for
payment and thereafter promptly pay for any Indebtedness that has been properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and in
accordance with the Debt Offers using funds provided by or at the direction of
Parent.

               (c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate
documentation in connection with the Debt Offers, including the Offer Documents.
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents.
The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings
to the holders of Indebtedness in connection with the Debt Offers shall be
subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and its legal
counsel. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offers any
information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer
Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall be
disseminated by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders
of the applicable Indebtedness (which supplement or amendment and dissemination
may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of a filing of a

mutual written consent of Parent and the Company.

         8.2   Termination by Either Parent or the Company. This Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned by Parent or the Company if (i)
any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, Parent, Holdings
or Merger Sub shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other

provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.2(iii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement results in such failure of the Merger to occur
on or prior to such date; provided further, however, that, if the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(c) shall not have been satisfied solely by reason of the
failure of any Governmental Consent that has been obtained to have become a
Final Order, neither party may terminate this Agreement prior to the 60th day
after the date on which such Governmental Consent was obtained.

         8.3   Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated by Parent
prior to the Effective Time (i) if the Company shall have failed to perform in
any material respect any of its material obligations under this Agreement to be
performed at or prior to such date of termination, which failure to perform is
not cured, or is incapable of being cured, within 30 days after the receipt by
the Company of written notice of such failure or (ii) if, subject to the

effected a Change of Recommendation.

         8.4   Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated by
the Company prior to the Effective Time (i) if Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub

cured, within 30 days after the receipt by Parent of written notice of such
failure or (ii) pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.4(e), if the Company,
prior to the termination of this Agreement, pays the Termination Fee to Parent.

         8.5   Effect of Termination.

               (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to

directors, officers or shareholders, other

                                       45
<PAGE>

than the provisions of this Section 8.5, the provisions of ARTICLE IX and the
last two sentences of Section 6.6. Nothing contained in this Section 8.5 shall
relieve any party from liability for any fraud or willful breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement.

               (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement:

                   (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(i), as a result of a
     breach by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
     Representatives of Section 6.3 or Section 6.4, or Section 8.3(ii);

                   (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.4(ii);

     within one (1) year after the termination of this Agreement the Company
     consummates, enters into a definitive agreement in respect of, or the Board
     approves or recommends, any Competing Proposal, or (y) a Competing
     Transaction is publicly announced or becomes publicly known and has been
     withdrawn and within one (1) year after the termination of this Agreement
     the Company consummates, enters into a definitive agreement in respect of,
     or the Board approves or recommends, a Competing Proposal with the Person
     that made the previously withdrawn Competing Proposal; provided that,
     solely for purposes of this Section 8.5(b)(iii), the term "Competing
     Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 6.4(a),
     except that all references to 15% shall be deemed to be 50%;

then the Company shall make payment to Parent of a fee in the amount equal to
$55,000,000, minus any previously paid Expense Reimbursement (the "Termination
Fee"), in the case of clause (i) above, within five (5) business days following

Termination Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement when due, the Termination Fee
and/or Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the
period commencing on the date the Termination Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement,
as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the

                                       46
<PAGE>

rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., in the City of New York
from time to time during such period, as such bank's prime lending rate plus 200
basis points. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee
and/or Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, when due, the Company shall
also pay to Parent all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of Parent

and/or Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be.

obligations of the Company contained in this Section 9.1(b), the "Expense
Reimbursement").

         9.2   Survival of Representations and Warranties; Survival of
Confidentiality. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or
in any schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section 9.2 shall not limit any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that by its terms is to be
performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and the provisions of
such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material
delivered by any party hereunder.

         9.3   Modification or Amendment. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after any vote of the shareholders of the Company contemplated
hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their
respective boards of directors (or individuals holding similar positions, in the
case of a party that is not a corporation), at any time prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; provided, however, that
after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no such
amendment, modification or supplement shall reduce or change the Merger
Consideration or adversely affect the rights of the Company's shareholders
hereunder without the approval of such shareholders.

<PAGE>

strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall

         9.8   Governing Law. Except to the extent that the laws of the State of
Minnesota mandatorily apply, this Agreement shall be governed, performed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction.

         9.9   Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly and
irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any court of New
York State sitting in New York County or any Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in New York County, and any appellate court from any thereof,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than
a U.S. federal or state court sitting in New York County; provided that each of
the parties shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding for
enforcement of a judgment entered by any U.S. federal court located in New York
County or any New York state court in any other court or jurisdiction.

         9.10  Service of Process. Each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in Section 9.9 in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by
registered U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address
as specified in or pursuant to Section 9.4. However, the foregoing shall not
limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by
any other legally available method.

         9.11  Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each nonbreaching
party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by
monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) will
waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to
which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance
of this Agreement in any action instituted in accordance with Section 9.9.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties

including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits hereto, together with
the other instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality
