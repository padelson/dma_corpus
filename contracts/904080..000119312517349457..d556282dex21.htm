forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, the Merger will occur and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Sailfish in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the conditions set
forth in, this Agreement, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub

(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Entity") and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of New Sailfish. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity will possess all of the rights, powers and privileges and
be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities and restrictions of Sailfish
and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL. At the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Entity shall

respectively, until such certificate of incorporation and bylaws are
thereafter amended in accordance with their respective terms and applicable

the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Entity, in each case except as set forth on _Annex 2.02_ , as may be updated
by Green Energy by written notice to Sailfish prior to the Effective Time, and
such directors and officers shall serve until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Entity.

 

Section 2.03 _Conversion of Shares_. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any other action on the part of Sailfish or any holder
of any capital stock of Sailfish:

(i) Each share of Sailfish Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and
will be converted into the right to receive one fully paid and non-assessable
share of New Sailfish Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration"), and each
holder of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this
Agreement; and

 

(ii) Each share of issued and outstanding common stock of Merger Sub owned by

28 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) The outstanding shares of common stock of New Sailfish held by
Sailfish immediately prior to the Effective Time will be repurchased for par
value and retired upon the Effective Time.

 Section 2.04 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, New Sailfish shall appoint the Exchange
Agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for:

(i) certificates representing shares of Sailfish Common Stock (the
"Certificates"); or

(ii) uncertificated shares of Sailfish Common Stock (the "Uncertificated
Shares").

Prior to the Effective Time, New Sailfish shall provide or shall cause to be
provided to the Exchange Agent shares of New Sailfish Common Stock sufficient
in order for the Exchange Agent to distribute the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Promptly after the Closing Date, New Sailfish will send, or
will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Sailfish
Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
that will specify that the delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title will pass, only on proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent.

(b) Each holder of shares of Sailfish Common Stock will be entitled
to receive, on

(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal (or other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), or

(ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares,

 

the aggregate Merger Consideration that the holder has a right to receive
under _Section_ __ _ 2.03_. The shares of New Sailfish Common Stock
constituting the Merger Consideration will be in uncertificated book-entry
form, unless a physical certificate is requested by the holder or is otherwise
required under applicable Law. As a result of the Merger, at the Effective
Time, all shares of Sailfish Common Stock will cease to be outstanding and
each holder of Sailfish Common Stock will cease to have any rights with
respect to the Sailfish Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Sailfish Common Stock under _Section_
__ _ 2.03_.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it will be a condition to the
payment that:

 



29 ##### Table of Contents

  

(i) either the surrendered Certificate will be properly endorsed or
will otherwise be in proper form for transfer or the applicable
Uncertificated Share will be properly transferred, and

(ii) the Person requesting the payment will pay to the Exchange Agent any
Transfer Taxes required as a result of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that the Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Sailfish Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity,
they will be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the Sailfish Common Stock provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this _Article_ __ _ 2_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent under  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders
of shares of Sailfish Common Stock 12 months after the Closing Date will be
returned to the Surviving Entity, on demand. Any holder who has not exchanged
shares of Sailfish Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ before that date will look only to the
Surviving Entity or New Sailfish for payment of the Merger Consideration, and
any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon.

(f) None of the Parties, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Sailfish Common Stock for any amounts
properly paid or delivered to a public official under applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Sailfish Common Stock six (6) years after the Closing Date (or
that earlier date, immediately before the time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) will
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.05 _Sailfish Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Sailfish shall take all such actions as are necessary to cause, as of the
Effective Time, each share of Sailfish Common Stock subject to vesting
repurchase rights or other lapse restrictions ("Sailfish Restricted Stock")
granted and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be
accelerated and settled in a share of New Sailfish Common Stock.

(b) Sailfish shall take all such actions as are necessary to cause, as of the
Effective Time, each restricted stock unit with respect to Sailfish Common
Stock (a "Sailfish Restricted Stock Unit") granted and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be accelerated and converted into a number of
shares of New Sailfish Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of
Sailfish Common Stock subject to such Sailfish Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Sailfish and New Sailfish shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or

Sailfish Restricted Stock or Sailfish Restricted Stock Units
(collectively, "Sailfish Incentive Awards") such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state,
local or foreign Tax or other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Sailfish, New Sailfish or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the

been paid to the holders of such Sailfish Incentive Awards, as applicable, in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Sailfish, New
Sailfish or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

delivery upon exercise, settlement, conversion or vesting of the Sailfish
Incentive Awards with respect to those individuals, if any, who, subsequent
to the Closing, will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable. New Sailfish shall administer the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent applicable.

 

(f) Prior to and at Closing, Sailfish and New Sailfish will take all actions
with respect to the Sailfish Stock Plans reasonably requested by Green
Energy, including, but not limited to, the termination of any or all Sailfish
Stock Plans, the assumption of any or all Sailfish Stock Plans by New
Sailfish, and the filing of a Form S-8 registration statement with respect to
shares of Sailfish Common Stock available for grant and delivery under the
Sailfish Stock Plans. Prior to and at Closing, Sailfish and New Sailfish will
take all actions with respect to the implementation of an omnibus equity
incentive plan reasonably requested by Green Energy, including, but not
limited to, the adoption of such omnibus equity incentive plan, the provision
of any requisite Sailfish or New Sailfish board of director and/or
shareholder approval, and the filing of a Form S-8 registration statement with
respect to shares of New Sailfish Common Stock available for grant and
delivery under any such omnibus equity incentive plan.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by New Sailfish in
accordance with

 the terms of the Warrant Agreement, and each Sailfish Warrant so assumed by
New Sailfish will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions of such Sailfish Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that such Sailfish Warrant shall cease to represent a warrant to
purchase Sailfish Common Stock and will be converted into a warrant (a "New
Sailfish Warrant") exercisable for the Merger Consideration which the
Sailfish Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Sailfish Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time would have been entitled to receive
upon consummation of the Merger. New Sailfish shall reserve for
future issuance a number of shares of New Sailfish Common Stock at least
equal to the number of shares of New Sailfish Common Stock that will be
subject to the New Sailfish Warrants.

 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time and in
accordance with the Warrant Agreement, Sailfish shall use its best efforts to
take such actions and deliver such documents as are required pursuant to the
Sailfish Warrants and by the warrant agent for the Sailfish Warrants.

 

Section 2.07 _Adjustments_. If during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Sailfish shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any

Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a
holder of Sailfish Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any applicable
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Sailfish Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

Section 2.09 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if

Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Sailfish, the use of the
Sailfish Intellectual Property by Sailfish and its Subsidiaries in the

and effect and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors
Rights, and neither Sailfish nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge

Sailfishs and its Subsidiaries Oil and Gas Properties, and to produce,
gather, process and handle, transport, and market Hydrocarbons from or
attributable to its and their respective currently-producing Oil and Gas
Properties and otherwise to conduct its business in the ordinary
course, consistent with past practice, and subject to the limitations,
qualifications, reservations and encumbrances contained in any Sailfish SEC
Document, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Sailfish Material Adverse Effect. Each of Sailfish and its Subsidiaries has
fulfilled and performed all its material obligations with respect to such
Rights-of-Way and conduct their business in a manner that does not violate
any of the Rights-of-Way and no event has occurred that allows, or after
notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination thereof or
would result in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any such
Rights-of-Way, except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Sailfish Material Adverse Effect. All flowlines, risers,
umbilicals, gathering lines, transportation facilities, platforms, and
facilities operated by Sailfish and its Subsidiaries (even if on platforms
not owned by Sailfish) are subject to Rights-of-Way, and there are no gaps
(including any gap arising as a result of any breach by Sailfish or any of

access to any platforms, gathering lines, transportation lines, or other
processing, marketing, or production handling facilities, whether under the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Interstate
Commerce Act, or otherwise. Any gas gathering system constituting a part of
the Oil and Gas Properties of Sailfish or its Subsidiaries has as its primary
function the provision of natural gas gathering services, as the term
"gathering" is interpreted under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, and none
of such Oil and Gas Properties have been or are certificated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") under Section 7(c) of the
Natural Gas Act or, to the knowledge of Sailfish are now subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC under the Natural Gas Act or Natural Gas Policy Act.
None of the Oil and Gas Properties of Sailfish or its Subsidiaries are
providing service under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act or under a
tariff or other authorization on file with or approved by any Governmental
Entity. None of the Oil and Gas Properties of or other oil pipelines owned by
Sailfish or its Subsidiaries are providing service under or subject to the
Interstate Commerce Act nor are Sailfish or its Subsidiaries or any such Oil
and Gas Properties or oil pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC

Section 4.18  _Oil_ __ _ and Gas Matters_.

(a) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have
a Sailfish Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
Sailfish Reserve Report and that is expressly described in Section 4.18(a) of
the Sailfish Disclosure Letter or (ii) reflected in the Sailfish Reserve
Report or in the Sailfish SEC Documents as having been sold or otherwise
disposed of, as of the date hereof, Sailfish and its Subsidiaries have good
and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the
reserves reflected in the Sailfish Reserve Report and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by Sailfish and its Subsidiaries, free and
clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of
the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" means title of Sailfish or
one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them
(or purported to be held or owned by them), beneficially or of record with any
applicable Governmental Entity that (1) entitles Sailfish (or one or more of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of
all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue
interest share shown in the Sailfish Reserve Report of all Hydrocarbons
produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and
Gas Properties (other than decreases in connection with operations in which
Sailfish or its applicable Subsidiary may be a non-consenting co-owner,
decreases resulting from reversion of interests to co-owners with respect to
operations in which such co-owners elected not to consent, decreases resulting
from the establishment of pools or units, and decreases required to allow
other working interest owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to
make up past under deliveries), (2) obligates Sailfish (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and
expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to,
such Oil and Gas Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on
the Sailfish Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than
increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to defaulting
or non-consenting co-owners under applicable operating agreements or Laws and
increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in the
net revenue interest of Sailfish and its applicable Subsidiaries) and (3) is
free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

(b) The factual, non-interpretive data (other than title data) supplied by
Sailfish to the Sailfish Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to the
Sailfish interests referred to in the Sailfish Reserve Report, by or on behalf
of Sailfish and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the
Sailfish Reserve Report was, as of the time provided, accurate in all material
respects. The oil and gas reserve estimates of Sailfish set forth in the
Sailfish Reserve Report are derived from reports that have been prepared
by the Sailfish Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates
fairly reflect, in all material respects, the oil and gas reserves of Sailfish
and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with
SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas
exploration, development and production industry (including changes in
commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has been no
change in respect of the matters addressed in the Sailfish Reserve Report that
has had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Sailfish Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,

and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties
and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned
or held by Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely and properly
paid, and (iii) none of Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries (and, to
Sailfishs knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of,
or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and
Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil
and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by
Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of Sailfish and its Subsidiaries are being received by such
selling entities in a timely manner and no proceeds from the sale of
Hydrocarbons produced from any such Oil and Gas Properties are being held in
suspense (by Sailfish, any of its Subsidiaries, any third party operator
thereof or any other Person or individual) for any reason except as reported
in the Sailfish SEC Documents. Neither Sailfish nor any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay payment, advance payment, or similar
payment (other than royalties, overriding royalties, and similar arrangements
established in the Oil and Gas Leases) to deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds
from the sale thereof, attributable to such Persons interest in its Oil and
Gas Properties at some future time without receiving payment therefor at the
time of delivery. As of the dates reflected in the Disclosure Letter, neither
Sailfish nor any of its Subsidiaries has any production, platform,
transportation, production handling, processing, plant, or other imbalance,
and no Person has given notice that any such imbalance constitutes all of
the relevant Persons ultimately recoverable reserves from a balancing area.

any Governmental Entity in effect to which any of the Green Entities is a
party or subject that materially interferes with, or would be reasonably
likely to materially interfere with, the business of any of the Green Entities
as currently conducted. 

Section 5.08 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of any of the Green Entities of any kind whatsoever (whether
accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise), other
than: (a) liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved against on the
balance sheet of Green Energy dated as of December 31, 2016 (including the
notes thereto) contained in the Green Financial Statements; (b) liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to December
31, 2016; (c) liabilities or obligations for fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, negotiation and consummation of the
Transactions; and (d) liabilities or obligations that have not had and would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.09 _Green Permits; Compliance with Applicable Law_.

(a) The Green Entities hold all franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders of all Governmental Entities (other than Oil and Gas
Leases) necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the
"Green Permits"), except where the failure to so hold has not had and would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green
Material Adverse Effect. All Green Permits are valid and in full force and
effect, no default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) has
occurred under any such Green Permit, and no suspension or cancellation of
such Green Permits is pending or threatened in writing or, to the knowledge of
Green Energy, threatened orally, except where the failure to be in full force
and effect, suspension or cancellation has not had and would not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse
Effect. The Green Entities are in compliance with the terms of the
Green Permits, except where the failure to so comply has not had and would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green
Material Adverse Effect. The businesses of the Green Entities are not
currently being conducted, and at no time during the past three years have
been conducted, in violation of any applicable Law, except for violations that
have not had and would not be reasonably likely to

 have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Green Energy, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Green Entities is pending or threatened, other
than those the outcome of which has not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Green Entities are in compliance with, and are not in default under or
in violation of, any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance,
default or violation has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect. No Green
Entity has received any written communication since January 1, 2014 from a
Governmental Entity that alleges that any Green Entity is not in compliance
with or is in default or violation of any applicable Law, except where
such non-compliance, default or violation would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Green Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.10 _Broker_ __ _s Fees_. Except for the fees and expenses payable
to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and UBS Securities LLC (the "Green Financial
Advisor"), no broker, investment banker, or other Person is entitled to any
brokers, finders or other similar fee or commission from the Green Entities
in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of Green Energy, and the agreements with respect to such engagements
have previously been made available to Sailfish.

 

Section 5.11 _Green Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Set forth on Section 5.11(a) of the Green Disclosure Letter is a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of each Green Benefit Plan. Green
Energy has furnished or made available to Sailfish true, correct and complete
copies of each of the Green Benefit Plans (or, with respect to any unwritten
Green Benefit Plan, a written summary thereof) and, to the extent applicable,
true, correct and complete copies of: (i) related trust documents and any
amendments thereto, (ii) the insurance contracts and any amendments thereto,
(iii) the most recent favorable determination or opinion letters, (iv) the
most recent report filed on Form 5500 and accompanying schedules, (v) the most
recent financial statements and actuarial reports, (vi) the current summary
plan description (including all summaries of material modifications thereto)
and (vii) all material correspondence received from or provided to the
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the IRS or any
other Governmental Entity during the past three years.

 

(b) Each Green Benefit Plan has been established and administered in
accordance with its terms and in material compliance with all applicable
Laws. Each Green Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code satisfies the requirements of Section
401(a) of the Code and has received a favorable determination letter as to
its qualification, or, if such Green Benefit Plan is a prototype plan, the
opinion or notification letter for each such Green Benefit Plan and nothing
has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that could reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

 



66 ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) There are no actions, suits or claims pending (other than routine claims
for benefits) or, to the knowledge of Green Energy, threatened against, or
with respect to, any of the Green Benefit Plans or their assets, except for
such actions, suits or claims that are not material to any Green Entity and to
the knowledge of Green Energy, no facts or circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, suit or claim. There
is no audit, inquiry, investigation, proceeding or examination pending or, to
the knowledge of Green Energy, threatened by the IRS, the Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Green Benefit Plan.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2014, all contributions required to be made to the Green
Benefit Plans pursuant to their terms or applicable Laws have been timely
made.

(e) There are no material unfunded benefit obligations that have not been
properly accrued for in the Green Financial Statements or disclosed in the
notes thereto in accordance with GAAP.

(f) No Green Entity, nor any member of an Aggregated Group to which any such
Person belongs, contributes to, has an obligation to contribute to, or has any
liability with respect to (including any contingent liability) and no Green
Benefit Plan is, a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (including a
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA), Section 302 of ERISA, or Section 412 of the Code or a multiple
employer welfare arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40)(A) or ERISA).

(g) No Green Benefit Plan or Green Entity provides, or has any obligation
to provide, current or former employees of a Green Entity (or any
beneficiaries thereof) welfare benefits (including medical and life or
disability insurance benefits) after such Person terminates employment with
the Green Entities, except for the coverage continuation requirements of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and as
codified in Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 _et. seq_. of ERISA. No
Green Benefit Plan and no Green Entity provides, or has any obligation to
provide, welfare benefits to any Person who is not an individual currently or
formerly designated by a Green Entity as an employee of a Green Entity or a
beneficiary thereof.

 

(h) Except for any items pursuant to the agreements set forth on Section
5.11(h) of the Green Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of this
Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with another event) will or can
be reasonably expected to (i) entitle any current or former director,
officer, employee or consultant of any Green Entity to any payment or benefit
(including severance pay/benefits or similar compensation), any cancellation
of indebtedness, or any increase in compensation; (ii) result in
the acceleration of payment, funding or vesting under any Green Benefit Plan;
or (iii) result in any increase in benefits payable under any Green Benefit
Plan. No amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form
of benefits or rights) in connection with the Transactions (either alone or
in combination with another event or subsequent action) will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Green
Entity has any obligation to make a "gross-up" or similar payment in respect
of any Taxes that may become payable Section 409A.

 



67 ##### Table of Contents

  

(i) Except as set forth on Section 5.11(i) of the Green Disclosure Letter, no
Green Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United
States or covers any employee residing or working outside the United States
(any such Green Benefit Plan, a "Foreign Benefit Plan"). With respect to each
Foreign Benefit Plan, the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit
Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Foreign
Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procedure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of
this Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants in such
Foreign Benefit Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations
most recently used to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit
Plan and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets
or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. Each Green
Benefit Plan which, under the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States, is required or approved by any Governmental Entity, has been so
registered and approved and, to the knowledge of Green Energy, has
been maintained in good standing with the applicable requirements of the
Governmental Entities and, if intended to qualify for special Tax treatment,
to the knowledge of Green Energy, there are no existing circumstances or
events that have occurred that could reasonably be expected to affect
adversely the special Tax treatment with respect to such Foreign Benefit
Plans.

 Section 5.12 _Labor Matters_.

(a) Since January 1, 2014, no Green Entity has been a party to, or bound by,
any collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with any labor union.

(b) Since January 1, 2014, there have been no existing or, to the knowledge
of Green Energy, threatened unfair labor practices, charges or grievances
against a Green Entity arising out of a collective bargaining agreement, other
agreement with any labor union, or other labor-related grievance proceedings.

(c) Since January 1, 2014, there have been no strikes, disputes, slowdowns,
work stoppages or lockouts existing or, to the knowledge of Green Energy,
threatened with respect to any employees of the Green Entities.

representation petitions or demands with respect to any employees of the
Green Entities and, to the knowledge of Green Energy, no union organizing
campaign or similar effort is pending or threatened with respect to any
employees of the Green Entities.

 

(e) All Green Entity employees are employed at will and all independent
contractors are properly classified under all applicable Laws, including
federal and state wage and hour laws.

(f) The Green Entities are, and since January 1, 2014 have been, in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting
employment and employment practices including but not limited to Laws relating
to wages and hours, including the Fair Labor Standards Act,
collective bargaining, unemployment insurance, workers compensation, equal
employment opportunity, discrimination, immigration control, employee

 classifications, misclassification of employees as independent contractors,
safety and health, reductions in force, including the WARN Act, and the
payment and withholding of Taxes, and there are no Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Green Energy, threatened against any Green Entity, by or on
behalf of any applicant for employment, any current or former employee or any
class of the foregoing, relating to any of the foregoing applicable Laws, or
alleging breach of any express or implied contract of employment, wrongful
termination of employment, or alleging any other discriminatory, wrongful or
tortious conduct in connection with the employment relationship, other
than any such matters described in this sentence that have not had and would
not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2014, no Green Entity has received
any written notice of the intent of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Labor or any
other Governmental Entity responsible for the enforcement of labor or
employment Laws to conduct an investigation with respect to any Green Entity
which has had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.13 _Taxes_.

 

(a) (i) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to
the Green Entities before the date hereof have been timely filed (taking into
account all extensions), and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects, (ii) the Green Entities have timely paid
all material Taxes due or claimed to be due, except for those Taxes being
contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been established
in the Green Financial Statements, (iii) all material Taxes required to be
withheld by the Green Entities have been timely withheld and, to the extent
required, paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity and the Green
Entities have complied with all information reporting and backup withholding
requirements, including maintenance of required forms and other records, and
(iv) the charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to the Green
Entities reflected in the December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet of
Green Energy are adequate under GAAP to cover unpaid Tax liabilities of the
Green Entities accruing through the date thereof.

(b) No Green Entity is party to any Tax Sharing Agreement, other than such an
agreement exclusively between or among the Green Entities, and no Green
Entity has been a member of an affiliated group (or similar state, local or
foreign filing group) filing a material consolidated income Tax Return.

 

(c) Except for such matters as have not had and would not be reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect,
there is no outstanding material claim, assessment or deficiency against any
Green Entity for any Taxes that has been asserted or threatened in writing by
any Governmental Entity, and no written claim has been made, within the
preceding three years, by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where no
Green Entity files Tax Returns or pays Taxes that it is obligated to file Tax
Returns or pay Taxes in such jurisdiction. No waiver or extension of any
statute of limitations with respect to the assessment or collection of Taxes
is in effect for the Green Entities.

 



69 ##### Table of Contents

  

(d) During the period beginning two years before the date hereof, no Green
Entity has been a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation for
purposes of Section 355 of the Code.

(e) Except as provided in Section 5.13 of the Green Disclosure Letter, each
Green Entity is classified as a disregarded entity or a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Any Green Entity that is a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes has made or will make a valid election under
Section 754 of the Code.

Section 5.14  _Intellectual Property_. The Green Entities own or have the
right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the
businesses of the Green Entities as presently conducted (collectively, the
"Green Intellectual Property") free and clear of all Encumbrances except for
Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to own or have the right to
use such properties has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of Green Energy, the use of the Green Intellectual Property by the
Green Entities in the operation of the business of the Green Entities as
presently conducted does not infringe upon or misappropriate any Intellectual
Property of any other Person, except for such matters that have not had and
would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Green Material Adverse Effect. The Green Entities have taken reasonable
measures to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets used in the
businesses of the Green Entities as presently conducted, except where failure
to do so has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the
Transactions will not diminish or terminate the ownership of or rights in any
material Intellectual Property owned or used by the Green Entities in their
respective businesses as currently conducted and, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Green Material Adverse Effect, to the
knowledge of Green Energy, after the Closing Date the Green Entities will have
the right to use such Intellectual Property on the same basis as prior to the
consummation of the Transactions.

Section 5.15 _Real Property_. Except as has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material
Adverse Effect, and except with respect to any of the Green Entities Oil and
Gas Properties, (a) the Green Entities have good, valid and defensible title
to all material real property owned by a Green Entity, in each case, including
office leases, equipment yards, warehouses, and shore base facilities
(collectively, the "Green Owned Real Property") and valid leasehold estates
in all material real property leased, subleased, licensed or otherwise
occupied (whether as tenant, subtenant or pursuant to other occupancy
arrangements) by a Green Entity (collectively, including the
improvements thereon, the "Green Material Leased Real Property") free and
clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances, (b) each agreement
under which a Green Entity is the landlord, sublandlord, tenant, subtenant, or
occupant with respect to the Green Material Leased Real Property (each, a
"Green Material Real Property Lease") to the knowledge of Green Energy is in
full force and effect and is valid and enforceable against the parties thereto
in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to Creditors
Rights, and no Green Entity, or to the knowledge of Green Energy, any other
party thereto, has received written notice of any default under any Green
Material Real Property Lease, and a true, correct and complete copy of each
Green Material Real Property Lease has been made available to Sailfish prior
to the date hereof, and (c) there does not exist any pending or, to the
knowledge of Green Energy, threatened, condemnation or eminent domain
proceedings that affect any of the Green Owned Real Property or Green Material
Leased Real Property.

Section 5.16 _Surface and Seabed Rights_. Each Green Entity has such Rights-
of-Way as are sufficient in all respects to access, construct, operate,
maintain, and repair the equipment and facilities related to such
Green Entitys Oil and Gas Properties, and to produce, gather, process and
handle, transport, and market Hydrocarbons from or attributable to their
respective currently-producing Oil and Gas Properties and otherwise to conduct
its business in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, except
for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green
Material Adverse Effect. Each Green Entity has fulfilled and performed all its
material obligations with respect to such Rights-of-Way and conducts its
business in a manner that does not violate any of the Rights-of-Way and no
event has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would
allow, revocation or termination thereof or would result in any impairment of
the rights of the holder of any such Rights-of-Way, except for such
revocations, terminations and impairments that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green
Material Adverse Effect. All flowlines, risers, umbilicals, gathering lines,
transportation facilities, platforms, and facilities operated by any Green
Entity (even if on platforms not owned by any Green Entity) are subject to
Rights-of-Way, and there are no gaps (including any gap arising as a result
of any breach by any Green Entity of the terms of any Rights-of-Way) in
the Rights-of-Way other than gaps that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material
Adverse Effect. No Green Entity has received any written claim for access to
any platforms, gathering lines, transportation lines, or other processing,
marketing, or production handling facilities, whether under the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Interstate Commerce
Act, or otherwise. Any gas gathering system constituting a part of the Oil and
Gas Properties of any Green Entity has as its primary function the provision
of natural gas gathering services, as the term "gathering" is interpreted
under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, and none of such Oil and Gas
Properties have been or are certificated by the FERC under Section 7(c) of the
Natural Gas Act or, to the knowledge of Green Energy, are now subject to the
jurisdiction of the FERC under the Natural Gas Act or Natural Gas Policy Act.
None of the Oil and Gas Properties of any Green Entity are providing service
under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act or under a tariff or other
authorization on file with or approved by any Governmental Entity. None of the
Oil and Gas Properties of or other oil pipelines owned by any Green Entity are
providing service under or subject to the Interstate Commerce Act nor is any
Green Entity or its Subsidiaries or any such Oil and Gas Properties or oil
pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC pursuant to the Interstate
Commerce Act.

 

Section 5.17 _Oil_ __ _ and Gas Matters_.

 

(a) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Green
Material Adverse Effect and except for property (i) sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of the Green
Reserve Report and expressly described in Section 5.17(a) of the Green
Disclosure Letter or (ii) reflected in the Green Reserve Report as having
been sold or otherwise disposed of, as of the date hereof, the Green Entities
have good and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis
for the reserves reflected in the Green Reserve Report and in each case
as attributable to interests owned by the

 



71 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Green Entities, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for Permitted
Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible
title" means that one or more of the Green Entities title (as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or
owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by them), beneficially or of
record (other than the Mexican Granting Instruments) with any applicable
Governmental Entity that (1) entitles one or more of the Green Entities to
receive (after satisfaction of all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not
less than the net revenue interest share shown in the Green Reserve Report of
all Hydrocarbons produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life
of such Oil and Gas Properties (other than decreases in connection with
operations in which any Green Entity may be a non-consenting co-owner,
decreases resulting from reversion of interests to co-owners with respect to
operations in which such co-owners elected not to consent, decreases resulting
from the establishment of pools or units, and decreases required to allow
other working interest owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to
make up past under deliveries), (2) obligates one or more of the Green
Entities to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the maintenance
and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas Properties,
of not greater than the working interest shown on the Green Reserve Report
for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than increases resulting from
contribution requirements with respect to defaulting or non-consenting co-
owners under applicable operating agreements or Laws and increases that are
accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in the net revenue interest
of the Green Entities) and (3) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other
than Permitted Encumbrances).

(b) The factual, non-interpretive data (other than title data) supplied by
the Green Entities to the Green Independent Petroleum Engineers relating to
the Green Entities interests referred to in the Green Reserve Report, in
connection with the preparation of the Green Reserve Report was, as of the
time provided, accurate in all material respects. The oil and gas reserve
estimates of the Green Entities set forth in the Green Reserve Report are
derived from reports that have been prepared by Green Energy and audited by
the Green Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly
reflect, in all material respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Green
Entities at the dates indicated therein. Except for changes generally
affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry
(including changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production,
there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Green
Reserve Report that has had or would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Except as has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Green Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins, periodic contractual fees and similar payments owed to any
Person or individual under (or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and Gas
Leases have been properly and timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum
royalties, overriding royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to
any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by any Green Entity have been timely
and properly paid and (iii) no Green Entity (and, to Green Energys
knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or
failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or
entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease)
included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by any Green Entity.
Except as set forth

 



72 ##### Table of Contents

  

 in Section 5.17(c) of the Green Disclosure Letter, no portion of the Mexican
Granting Instruments, or the lands or rights covered thereby, has been
relinquished or surrendered, and the Green Energy Disclosure Letter
accurately describes the current geographic area covered thereby after any
such relinquishments and surrenders, together with the current phase of each
Mexican Granting Instrument or portion thereof.

 

(d) All proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Green Entities are being received by such selling entities
in a timely manner and no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from
any such Oil and Gas Properties are being held in suspense (by any Green
Entity, any third party operator thereof or any other Person or individual)
for any reason except as set forth on Section 5.17(d) of the Green Disclosure
Letter. No Green Entity is obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay
payment, advance payment, or similar payment (other than royalties,
overriding royalties, and similar arrangements established in the Oil and Gas
Leases) to deliver Hydrocarbons or proceeds from the sale thereof,
attributable to such Persons interest in its Oil and Gas Properties at some
future time without receiving payment therefor at the time of delivery. As of
the dates reflected in Section 5.17(d) of the Green Disclosure Letter, no
Green Entity has any production, platform, transportation, production
handling, processing, plant, or other imbalance, and no Person has given
notice that any such imbalance constitutes all of the relevant Persons
ultimately recoverable reserves from a balancing area.

 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no authorizations for
expenditure or other commitments to make capital expenditures (or series of
related authorizations for expenditure or commitments) binding on any Green
Entity with respect to its or their respective Oil and Gas Properties that
Green Energy reasonably anticipates will individually require expenditures
after the Effective Time of greater than $10,000,000. Section 5.17(e) of the
Green Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete description of any work
program and/or budget for the current year and any future year, including
any multi-year work program and budget, and any development plan, appraisal
plan, exploration plan, or production plan in each case, that is binding or
required with respect to the Mexican Granting Instruments or by virtue of Law,
has been approved by the operating committee or other governing body under
any applicable operating agreement, or has been approved or mandated by any
Governmental Entity. No Green Entity is obligated (and has not, during the
term of the Mexican Granting Instruments) to make any payment arising out of
a failure to comply with minimum work obligations, minimum appraisal
obligations, or any approved work program or budget.

 

(f) All currently-producing wells and equipment related to Oil and Gas
Properties operated by any Green Entity are in an operable state of repair,
adequate to maintain operations in accordance with past practice, ordinary
wear and tear excepted. Section 5.17(f) of the Green Disclosure Letter sets
forth any assessment of pre-existing damages provided to an applicable
Governmental Entity under the Mexican Granting Instruments.

 

(g) As of the date hereof, no Green Entity has failed to elect to participate
in (or affirmatively elected not to participate in) any operation or activity
which could result in any of such Persons interest in any of its Oil and Gas
Properties becoming subject to a penalty, premium, or forfeiture as a result
of such election or lack thereof.

Gas Properties that such Person is, or will within 18 months after the date
hereof be, obligated by any Laws or contract to plug, dismantle, decommission,
and/or abandon or that have been plugged, dismantled, decommissioned, and/or
abandoned in a manner that does not comply in all material respects with

allocable to, each Mexican Granting Instrument. All such costs are "Eligible
Costs" under the Mexican Granting Instruments.

(l) Each Mexican Granting Instrument, and each amendment or modification
issues with respect thereto, or waiver of rights or interpretation by a
Governmental Entity thereunder, has been validly issued and approved by the
applicable Governmental Entities.

 

(m) The applicable Green Entity has such rights to export Hydrocarbons from
the United Mexican States as are set forth in the Mexican Granting

as are set forth in the Mexican Granting Instruments have not been curtailed
or suspended by any Governmental Entity.

 

(n) Section 5.17(n) of the Green Disclosure Letter contains an accurate and
complete description of any plugging and abandonment or decommissioning
trust, surety, or other security, poste, _provided_ , or otherwise held by or

(other than to the extent necessary (i) for the absence of a quorum, or (ii)

incentive compensation plan, program or arrangement), for purposes of

each Continuing Employee with credit for all co-payments, deductibles and
out-of-pocket limits and other fees paid by such Continuing Employee and his

Green Contribution and the Green Debt Exchange, as part of a tax-deferred
contribution under Section 351 of the Code;

 

(v) the New Sailfish Contribution and Conversion will be treated as a tax-
free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and as a mere

that could adversely impact the Intended Tax Treatment, including, among other
things, transferring, merging, liquidating or changing the tax classification
of any of New Sailfish Sub, the Apple Blockers or the Ride Blocker or
changing the tax classification of Old Sailfish LLC.

(b) For purposes of the Merger and the New Sailfish Reorganization,
this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within

adverse effects that would reasonably be expected to be borne by Sailfish if
such transactions were not undertaken), (ii) have an adverse effect on the
value of the New Sailfish Common Stock to be issued in the Merger (taking into
account any adverse effects that would reasonably be expected to affect the

Section 7.04 _Access; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each of Sailfish and Green Energy shall, and each of them shall cause each
of its respective Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to the other Party and its

counsel, financial advisors and other representatives (collectively, the
"Representatives"), during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article_
__ _ 9_, reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice,
to the officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities of such Party and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records,
contracts and documents and (ii) furnish reasonably promptly to the other
Party and its Representatives such information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as may be
reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of the other Party.
Each of Sailfish and Green Energy and their respective Representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the other Party or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt
and timely discharge by the employees of the other Party and its Subsidiaries
of their normal duties. Each Party shall have the right to have a designee of
such Party accompany the other Party and its Representatives on any visits or
inspections of any properties of such Party and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Party shall be
required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish
information to the other Party or any of its Representatives to the extent
that such information is subject to attorney-client privilege or the attorney
work-product doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such
information is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or
agreement ( _provided _ that each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the consent or waiver of any counterparty to such agreement
necessary to disclose information otherwise disclosable hereunder), or that
such access would jeopardize the protection of competitively sensitive
information or that such access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no Party shall have access to personnel records
of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information that
in such other Partys good faith opinion upon the advice of legal counsel the
disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries
to risk of liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be
permitted to conduct any sampling or analysis of any environmental media or
building materials at any facility of the other Party or its Subsidiaries
without the prior written consent of such other Party (which may be granted or
withheld in such other Partys sole discretion). Each Party agrees that it
will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.04(a)_ for any purpose unrelated
to the Transactions.

fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) prior to furnishing any non-public
information that is prohibited from being furnished pursuant to _Section_ __ _

_(iv)_ and/or _(v)_ of the defined term "Change of Recommendation", if prior
to taking or, as applicable, failing to take, such action:

 



101 ##### Table of Contents

  

(A) the Sailfish Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Competing Proposal
is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to effect such a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (taking into account any adjustment to the terms and
conditions of the Transactions proposed by Green Energy in response to such
Competing Proposal);

 

(B) Sailfish shall have given prior written notice to Green Energy at least
five (5) Business Days prior to taking such action (1) that Sailfish has
received such proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
proposal and (2) that Sailfish intends to take such action, and the basis for

its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (and taking into account any
legally binding (if accepted by Sailfish) adjustment or modification of the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Green Energy), shall have
determined in good faith that the Competing Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal and that failure to effect such a Change of Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each time material modifications to the terms of
a Competing Proposal that the Sailfish Board has determined to be a Superior
Proposal are made, Sailfish shall be required to deliver a Notice to Green
Energy and to again comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
7.05(e)(iii)_ with respect to such revised Competing Proposal (it being
understood that the Notice Period in respect of such revised Competing
Proposal shall be the longer of (x) the remaining time of the initial Notice
Period and (y) three Business Days); and

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Sailfish Stockholder Approval, in response to an Intervening
Event, if the Sailfish Board so chooses, cause Sailfish to take any action
contemplated by _clause_ __ _ (i)_ and/or _(ii)_ of the defined term "Change
of Recommendation", if prior to taking such action:

(A) the Sailfish Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;

 

(B) Sailfish shall have given prior written notice (an "IE Notice") to Green
Energy at least five (5) Business Days prior to taking such action that
Sailfish has determined that an Intervening Event has occurred or arisen
(which notice will reasonably describe such Intervening Event, including a
detailed description of the events, facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event and any material documents and correspondence in respect of
such Intervening Event and the reasons for such Change of Recommendation) and
that Sailfish intends to effect such Change of Recommendation;

Green Energy (to the extent Green Energy desires to negotiate) regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by
Green Energy in response to such Intervening Event; and

(D) following the IE Notice Period, the Sailfish Board, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (and taking into
account any legally binding (if accepted by Sailfish) adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Green
Energy), shall have determined in good faith that such proposed changes do
not obviate the need for the Sailfish Board to effect such Change of
Recommendation and that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the Sailfish Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. 

(f) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ is intended to restrict Sailfish, in
response to an unsolicited inquiry related to an actual or potential
Competing Proposal, from informing any Person of the existence of the

(g) Sailfish shall use its reasonable best efforts to inform all
Representatives of Sailfish and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the

any breach of any of the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ by any Sailfish
Subsidiary or by any officer, director or employee of Sailfish or its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _  7.05_ by

Section 7.10 _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have

Law in effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time and
until the six year anniversary of the Effective Time, New Sailfish shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of any Green Signing Party or
of Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any
Green Benefit Plan or any Sailfish Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the
request of any Green Signing Party or of Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, Employee
Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise (the "Indemnified Persons") against
all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including
attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a
party or is otherwise involved, including as a witness, based, in whole or in
part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is
or was a director, officer or employee of any Green Signing Party or of
Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Green Benefit Plan
or of any Sailfish Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request of any
Green Signing Party or of Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other
enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any
such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to or at the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"),
including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law (and New Sailfish and Old Sailfish LLC shall, jointly and severally, pay
expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding
to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is
brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may
retain Sailfishs regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Persons, and New Sailfish shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as
promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii) New Sailfish shall use
its best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified
Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.10(a)_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify
New Sailfish (but the

 



107 ##### Table of Contents

  

 failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any obligations that it
may have under this _Section_ __ _ 7.10(a)_ except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such partys position with respect to such claims).
With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification by New Sailfish under this _Section_ __ _
7.10(a)_, such Indemnified Person shall have the right to require that such
determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the
Indemnified Person and approved by New Sailfish (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed
material services for New Sailfish, Sailfish, or the Indemnified Person within
the last three years. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 7.10(c)_, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.10(a)_ shall not require
New Sailfish to indemnify, defend or hold harmless, or advance expenses to,
any Indemnified Person in connection with any Proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such Indemnified Person. 

(b) New Sailfish shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in
the Organizational Documents of New Sailfish, or any of its Subsidiaries in
any manner that would affect (or manage New Sailfish or any of its
Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would affect) adversely
the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of New Sailfish
or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by applicable Law.
In addition to the rights provided such persons by applicable Law, New
Sailfish shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and exculpation from
liability existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and
employees of Sailfish and its Subsidiaries.

(c) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, New Sailfish shall
indemnify any Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be
payable in advance upon request as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_,
relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Persons rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.10_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of
whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Sailfish will procure "tail" directors and officers liability and fiduciary
liability insurance policies with a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six years from the Effective Time placed with insurance companies having
the same or better AM Best Financial rating as Sailfishs current directors
and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance companies with terms
and conditions providing retentions, limits and other material terms no less
favorable than the current directors and officers liability and fiduciary
liability insurance policies maintained by Sailfish with respect to matters,
acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Sailfish may not spend more than 300% (the
"Cap Amount") of the last annual premium paid by Sailfish prior to the date
hereof for the six years of coverage under such "tail" policies.

 

(e) In the event that New Sailfish or any Subsidiary of New Sailfish, or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or

 



108 ##### Table of Contents

  

 merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of New Sailfish or such Subsidiary of New
Sailfish, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.10(a)_. New Sailfish shall not sell, transfer, distribute or
otherwise dispose of any of their assets or the assets of any Subsidiary in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to render New Sailfish unable to
satisfy its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.10(a)_. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the parties and each Person entitled to indemnification or
insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.10_, and his heirs and representatives.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Sailfish or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents or fiduciaries under any Sailfish Benefit Plan, it being

__ _ 7.10_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any
such policies.

apparent on the face of such disclosure, notwithstanding the presence or
absence of an appropriate section of the Sailfish Disclosure Letter or the

5.06(c)_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, except to the

(d) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or covenants or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Sailfish
Disclosure Letter or the Green Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such

controversy between the Parties to determine whether any obligation, item or
matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR

BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

(b) Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to submit itself to
the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(the "Chancery Court") or, if, but only if, the Chancery Court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware
with respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the courts of the State of Delaware, as described above,
and (iv) WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION RELATED
TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.04_ shall prevent any Party from
bringing an action or proceeding in any jurisdiction to enforce any judgment
of the Chancery Court or any federal court located in the State of Delaware,
as applicable. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ shall be effective
service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties hereby
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with such action,
suit, or proceeding in the manner provided by _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ or in
such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

Section 10.05 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Each Party accordingly agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages) to (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, including the
consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) an injunction restraining such
breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where the parties are obligated
to consummate the Transactions and the Transactions have not been consummated
(other than as a result of the other partys refusal to close in violation of
this Agreement) each of the parties expressly acknowledges and agrees that the
other party and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that
monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party and its
stockholders, and that such other party on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically the breaching partys
obligation to consummate the Transactions. Each Party accordingly agrees not
to raise any objection to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _
10.05_. Each Party further agrees that no other Party and no other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish, or post any bond or similar instrument
in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.05_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

Section 10.06 _Counterparts; Electronic Transmission of Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
Parties in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of electronic mail

 Section 10.07 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall
be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void; _provided_ that a Party may, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, assign any or all of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates;
_provided further_ that such assignment by a Party shall not limit or affect
such Partys obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other
than the Parties and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof, except that (i) after the Closing, each
Indemnified Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary of _Section_
__ _ 7.10_ and may specifically enforce its terms and (ii) the Debt Providers
and their respective current, former or future directors, officers, general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons,
Affiliates, employees or Representatives shall be third party beneficiaries of
_Section_ __ _ 9.05_, _Section_ __ _ 10.04_ and this _Section_ __ _
10.07_. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sailfish agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives
(collectively, the "Sailfish Related Parties") that the Debt Providers and
their Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives and each of their
successors and assigns (i) shall be subject to no liability or claims by the
Sailfish Related Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the
New Revolving Credit Facility, or the performance of services by such Debt
Providers or their Affiliates or Representatives with respect to the
foregoing and (ii) are express third party beneficiaries of this section
(which may not be changed as to any Debt Provider without its prior written
consent).

 

Section 10.08 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
each Party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 10.09 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it

 legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if
not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and
obligations of the Parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

Section 10.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, at
any time before or after approval of this Agreement and the Transactions by
action by or on behalf of the respective Boards of Directors of the Parties or
the stockholders of Sailfish; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
Sailfish Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law would
require the approval of such stockholders, without first obtaining such
approval. This Agreement (including the Sailfish Disclosure Letter and the
Green Disclosure Letter) may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 

Section 10.11 _Waiver_. Any failure of any of the Parties to comply with any
obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein
may be waived at any time prior to the Closing by any of the Parties entitled
to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by each such Party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

 

Section 10.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the other
Combination Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, and the other
documents and instruments executed pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings (both
written and oral), among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.
