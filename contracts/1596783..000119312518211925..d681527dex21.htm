THE OFFER

 

Section 2.1. _Tender Offer_.

 

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have previously been validly terminated in
accordance with _Article 8_ , as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within the ten (10) Business Day period commencing on the first (1st) Business
Day after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase for cash all of the
outstanding Company Common Stock (including any Company Common Stock subject
to repurchase rights in favor of the Company) at a price per share equal to
the Offer Price. The date on which Merger Sub commences the Offer, within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to as the "Offer
Commencement Date." The Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set
forth on _Annex I_.

(b) Subject to any extension by Merger Sub of the Offer pursuant to  _Section
2.1(e)_, as promptly as practicable on the later of (i) __ the earliest date
as of which Merger Sub is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn), and (ii) __ the earliest date as of which each of the conditions
set forth in Annex I (the "Offer Conditions") shall have been waived by Merger
Sub or Parent (to the extent so waivable by the terms of this Agreement) or
satisfied, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) consummate
the Offer and irrevocably accept for purchase all Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn). The obligation
of Merger Sub to irrevocably accept for purchase Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the Offer Conditions (and shall not be subject to any other
conditions). As promptly as possible after (and, in any event, no more than
three (3) Business Days after) the irrevocable acceptance for purchase of any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, Merger Sub
shall pay the Offer Price (subject to any applicable withholding tax) for all
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer. Payments of the Offer Price shall be made in cash, net
of applicable withholding taxes and without interest, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right, subject to compliance
with the Exchange Act, but only in a manner that is not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, to waive, amend or modify any Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum

 



13  Condition) in their sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without
the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall:

 

(i) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition;

 

(ii) decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be
purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer;

 

(iii) reduce the Offer Price (except to the extent required pursuant to
_Section 2.1(f))_;

 

(iv) increase the Offer Price, except in response to a Change in
Recommendation or a Superior Proposal Notice;

 

(v) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer (except to the
extent required pursuant to  _Section 2.1(e)_);

(vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer;

 

(vii) impose any condition to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions;

 

(viii) amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner
adversely affecting, or that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on, any of the holders of Company Common Stock; or

(ix) take any action (or fail to take any action) that would result in the
Merger not being permitted to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
DGCL.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the
"Initial Expiration Date") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date and
time to which the Offer has been so extended (the "Expiration Date").

 

(e) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
from time to time as follows: (i) if on the scheduled Expiration Date, the
Minimum Condition has not been satisfied or any of the other Offer Conditions
has not been satisfied, or waived by Parent or Merger Sub if permitted
hereunder, then Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for one (1) or
more occasions in consecutive increments of ten (10) Business Days each (or
such longer period as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company) in order to
permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions (subject to the right of
Parent or Merger Sub to waive any Offer Condition, other than the Minimum
Condition); _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date later than the End Date;
and (ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ
or its staff.

 



14 (f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance
Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action; provided that nothing in this _Section
2.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(g) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then-scheduled Expiration Date unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer, shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of

of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees
to use all reasonable efforts to promptly cause the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and to promptly be disseminated to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by applicable
Law. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to
Parent, Merger Sub or Parents legal counsel any information concerning the
Acquired Companies and the Companys stockholders that is required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section 2.2(a)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and
its counsel with a copy of any written comments and a description of any oral
comments that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the 

 



15  Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement,
and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and Merger
Sub, any shares of Company Common Stock subject to notices of guaranteed
delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer unless and
until the shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered
to Merger Sub or to an agent of Merger Sub. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company
Board Recommendation as it may be amended or modified, and until but not
after it is withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this Agreement, and to the
inclusion of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 (as defined below) with the Offer
Documents disseminated to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.10_, Parent shall cause
to be provided to Merger Sub all of the funds necessary to purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that all of
their respective controlled Affiliates shall, tender any shares of Company
Common Stock held by them into the Offer. 

(c) This Agreement and the Transactions shall be effected under Section 251(h)
of the DGCL and Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be effected
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer.

(d) The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act. On the date filed with the SEC, on the
date first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders and at all
other times at or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied in writing by the Company
specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC, at
the time the Schedule 14D-9 is mailed to the stockholders of the Company, or
at any other time at or prior to the Acceptance Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

written comments and a description of any oral comments received by the

or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and give Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any response to such

Company need not give Parent and its counsel such opportunity to review and
comment in connection with any such response or comments that relate to any

(b) To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, (i) each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 if such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall take all steps necessary
to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to correct
such information, to be filed with the SEC and, subject to the final sentence
of this _Section 2.3(b)_, to be disseminated to holders of Company
Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent or Merger Sub that may be reasonably requested
by the Company in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section

otherwise disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock together with
the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock.

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as
permitted by  _Section 2.3(e)_ or _Section 6.2_: (i) withdraw, modify,
amend or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation, or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable any
Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clause "(i)" or clause "(ii)"
being referred to as a "Change in Recommendation"); or (iii) cause the Company
to enter into any letter of intent or similar document, agreement or
commitment, agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or
nonbinding), understanding, agreement or contract (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with _Section 6.2(a)_)
contemplating an Acquisition Proposal (any such contract, an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement").

 



17 (d) The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act. On the date filed with the SEC, on the
date first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders and at all
other times at or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Schedule 14D-9 shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to any information supplied in writing by Parent or Merger Sub

Offer Documents will, at the time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC,
at the time the Offer Documents are mailed to the stockholders of the Company,
or at any other time prior to the Acceptance Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may:

 

(i) make a Change in Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal or
cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
concerning an Acquisition Proposal if (and prior to any such action): (A) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of _Section
6.2(a)_; (B) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith, (1) after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal would, if this Agreement or the Offer were not
amended or an alternative transaction with Parent were not entered into,
constitute a Superior Proposal and (2) after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure
to make a Change in Recommendation or to cause the Company to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning such Acquisition Proposal
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (C) the Company
delivers to Parent no less than four (4) Business Days prior to any Change in
Recommendation or execution of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement a written
notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice") stating that the Company Board intends

Acquisition Agreement, including a copy of such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement), including all required information under _Section 6.2(b)_ (which
notice shall not be deemed to constitute a Change in Recommendation); (D)
during the four (4) Business Day period commencing on the date of Parents
receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (as may be extended pursuant to this
_Section 2.3(e)(i)_, the "Notice Period"), the Company shall, and shall cause
its financial advisors, legal counsel and its representatives to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or a possible
alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject
of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal; (E) after
the expiration of the Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith,

 



18  after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer
that Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a
result of the negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that (1) after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (2) after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, the failure to make a Change in
Recommendation or enter into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Laws; and (F) if the Company enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement concerning such Superior Proposal, the
Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if after compliance by the Company with
clauses "(C)" through "(E)" of this _Section 2.3(e)(i)_ with respect to any
Superior Proposal, any material revisions are made to such Superior Proposal
or any other Superior Proposal is made by or on behalf of the same Person or
any of such Persons Affiliates, the Company shall promptly deliver to Parent
a "new written notice" notifying Parent of such revisions or such other
Superior Proposal and shall comply with clauses "(C)" through "(E)" of this
_Section 2.3(e)(i)_ with respect to such "new written notice," it being
understood that a new Notice Period under this _Section 2.3(e)(i)_ shall
apply to any such "new written notice," except that such Notice Period shall
be two (2) Business Days instead of four (4) Business Days; or

 

(ii) make a Change in Recommendation not related to an Acquisition Proposal if
(and prior to taking such action): (A) any event, occurrence, fact, or change
materially affecting the Company that does not relate to any Acquisition
Proposal and was not known to the Company Board or reasonably foreseeable on
or prior to the date hereof (any such development or event, a "Change in
Circumstances") becomes known to the Company Board after the date of this
Agreement; (B) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of
such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (C) the Company
delivers to Parent a written notice no less than four (4) Business Days prior
to any Change in Recommendation stating that the Company Board intends to
effect a Change in Recommendation and specifying in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances, and such Change in Recommendation is not effected
prior to the fourth (4th) Business Day after Parent receives written notice
from the Company confirming that the Company Board intends to effect such
Change in Recommendation; (D) during such four (4) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement or the Offer or enter into an alternative
transaction so that a Change in Recommendation would no longer be necessary;
and (E) at the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and after taking into account any amendments to this
Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably agreed in
writing to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause
"(D)" above, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to
effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Laws.

 



19 (f) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish Merger
Sub with mailing labels, security position listing, non-objecting beneficial
owner list and any available listing or computer list containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Company Common Stock as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall furnish Merger Sub with such additional
available information (including updated lists of holders of Company Common
Stock and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Parent or
its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to, and
soliciting tenders of Company Common Stock from, the Companys record and
beneficial stockholders. All information furnished in accordance with this 
_Section 2.3(f)_ shall be held in confidence by Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement, and shall
be used by Parent and Merger Sub only in connection with the communication of
the Offer to the holders of Company Common Stock.

the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law, in

agreements, applicable Law or otherwise) to effect the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 3.7_, including by amending the applicable Company Equity
Incentive Plans.

Section 3.8. _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and each holder

to Section 262 of the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of

the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation. If any holder of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or shall
otherwise waive, withdraw or lose such holders right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) the right of such holder to be paid such
consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
shall cease, and (ii) such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into and have become exchangeable only for
the right to receive (upon the surrender of the Company Stock Certificate(s)
or Book Entry Shares previously representing such Appraisal Shares) the Merger
Consideration, without interest and reduced by the amount of any withholding
that is required under applicable Tax Law, in accordance with _Section
3.11_.

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demand by any
stockholder of the Company for appraisal of such stockholders Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and Legal
Proceedings with respect to any such demand, and the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to

of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL.

with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

Section 3.10. _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company or otherwise)
take such action to the extent that they deem appropriate in order to
effectuate the intent of this Agreement and further the Acquisition.

Section 3.11. _Withholding of Tax_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, after consultation with and providing adequate
written notice to the Company, each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
of the Acquired Companies, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent (each, a

consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Compensatory Awards such amount as such
Withholding Party is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by a Withholding
Party and withheld amounts are paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity in accordance with applicable Law, then for all purposes of this
Agreement such amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the former
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Compensatory Awards in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.12. _Lost Company Stock Certificates_. If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate,
the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest
thereon and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under
applicable Tax Law, in accordance with _Section 3.11_.

51 Section 6.2. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company will not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, not to and will
instruct, and use reasonable best efforts, to cause its representatives
(including any employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant, consultant
or other agent or advisor employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or that
provides services in connection with the Offer or the Merger) not to:

(i) solicit, initiate, endorse or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
the submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry or any proposals or offers that constitute or would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (including by approving
any transaction, or approving any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder," for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL);

 

(ii) furnish any information regarding the Company to any Person for the
purpose of encouraging, or in response to, an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry;

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or

(iv) approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or
similar document, agreement or commitment, or agreement in principle (whether
written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than any confidentiality agreement contemplated by this
_Section 6.2_).

 

 _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company and its representatives may engage in any such
discussions or negotiations and provide any such information in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the
extent that: (A) prior to providing any non-public information or engaging in
any discussions or negotiations with any Third Party in response to such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such Third Party (or there is
then in effect with such party) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; and (B) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. Prior to or concurrent with providing any non-public information to
such Third Party, the Company shall make such non-public information available
to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously
made available by the Company to Parent or Parents representatives). Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any Subsidiary of the Company or any of the
officers, directors or representatives (including any employee, investment
banker, attorney, accountant, consultant or other agent or advisor employed by
the Company or its Subsidiaries or that provides services in connection with
the Merger) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the Company.

 



52 (b) If the Company or any of its officers, directors, controlled affiliates
and representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry)
notify Parent in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
(which notification shall include the material terms and conditions thereof),
and shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed of any material change to
the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

(c) The Company shall, and shall ensure that its representatives, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions
or negotiations with, any Third Party relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry. The Company also agrees that (i) to the extent it has not
previously done so, it will promptly request each Third Party that has
executed a confidentiality agreement prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with such Persons consideration of a transaction involving, or the
acquisition of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any portion
thereof) to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person or its representatives by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
release any Third Party from, or terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality or standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, unless the Company Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, and
(iii) subject to the foregoing clause (ii), the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their representatives from:
(i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, provided that any
such disclosure does not contain an express Change in Recommendation; (ii)
disclosing to the Companys stockholders any factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the
party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal (and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed
to be a Change in Recommendation); or (iii) communicating with any Person (or
the representatives of such Person) that makes any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry to the extent necessary to direct such Person to the
provisions of this _Section 6.2_; _provided, however_ , __that the Company
Board shall not make any Change in Recommendation except in accordance with
_Section 2.3(e)_.

Section 6.3. _Filings; Other Action_.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly (and in no
event later than the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the later of
the date hereof and the earliest date permitted) use reasonable best efforts
to make and effect all registrations, filings and submissions required to be
made or effected by it or otherwise advisable pursuant to the HSR 

 



53  Act, other applicable Antitrust Laws, the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements with respect to the Offer and the Merger; (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required
from Third Parties in connection with the Transactions; and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other
actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and
effectuating the Transactions; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or
other consideration to any Person (other than a required fee to
any Governmental Entity in connection with a filing in support of the
Transactions) for any consent or approval required for the consummation of any
of the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Parent and Merger Sub (A) shall promptly provide all information requested by
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions and (B) shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all actions and steps necessary to
obtain and secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws and obtain any
clearance or approval required to be obtained from the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, any state attorney general, any
foreign competition authority or any other Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in _Section
6.3(a)_, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, each party hereto shall:
(i) give the other parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement
of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or
before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or
any of the other Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the
status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication
to or from the SEC, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the Merger.
Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Legal Requirement, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the
other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not settle or offer, compromise or agree to
settle or compromise any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or
the Merger or any of the other Transactions without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(c) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action or Legal Proceeding is commenced challenging the Offer or the Merger
or any of the other Transactions and such litigation, action or Legal
Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take commercially reasonable actions to resolve any

 



54  such litigation, action or Legal Proceeding and each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to contest any such litigation, action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions.

(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit
their respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights,
assets, business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license,
joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would
reasonably be expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to
the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions.

 

Section 6.4. _Access_. Upon reasonable advance written notice, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Parents representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to the Acquired Companies books and records and, during
such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all readily
available information concerning its business as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided, however,_ that the Acquired Companies shall not be
required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company could: (a) result
in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of Third Parties; (b) violate any
obligation of the Acquired Companies with respect to confidentiality, non-
disclosure or privacy; (c) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under
the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine; (d)
violate any Legal Requirement; or (e) materially interfere with the conduct of
the Acquired Companies businesses. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement
of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.
All requests for access pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ must be directed to
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company or another person designated in
writing by the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective
representatives not to, contact any customer or supplier of the Company in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions without
the Companys prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that any such contact shall be arranged by and with a
representative of the Company participating. All information obtained by
Parent and its representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be
treated as "Evaluation Material" of the Acquired Companies for purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 6.5. _Interim Operations of Merger Sub_. During the period from the
date hereof through the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities
of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.6. _Publicity_. The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public

 



55  statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided that (i) a party hereto may, without the prior consent of
the other parties hereto, issue such press release or make such public
statement as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of NASDAQ
if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other
parties hereto and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do
so prior to the time such press release or public statement is so required to
be issued or made, (ii) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such
consultation with respect to communication that are (1) principally directed
to employees, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications
are consistent with previous releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved the other party), or
(2) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Change in
Recommendation or "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and in
compliance with applicable Laws, Parent and the Company shall develop a joint
plan for communication to the Companys employees, Workers, customers,
suppliers and other strategic Persons about this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and upon development of such plan,
Parent and the Company shall comply with such plan. Prior to making any
written communications to the employees or Workers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comment made
by Parent on such communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

Section 6.7. _Other Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months (or, if less than twelve
(12) months, during the period of the respective employees employment) after
the Closing Date and consistent with _Section 6.7(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
other appropriate Acquired Company to, provide to each employee of the
Acquired Companies who continues employment with Parent or the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time and not later terminated by the
applicable employer (each, a "Continuing Employee") with (i) (A) base salary
or base hourly wage rate (as applicable) and (B) cash incentive compensation
opportunity (including bonuses and commissions), in each case in an amount at
least equal to that provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) other benefits (other than equity awards) that are
not substantially less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to each
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In addition, Parent shall assume and honor, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to assume and honor, the terms
of the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 6.7(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, provide for terms and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee
in accordance with applicable Law. Subject to the preceding sentence, nothing
in this  _Section 6.7_ shall preclude Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
other appropriate Acquired Company from making changes to the

 



56  terms and conditions of employment of any Continuing Employees who become
employed by the Surviving Corporation or other appropriate Acquired Company as
of the Closing Date or terminating Continuing Employees or other employees in
the ordinary course of business, in each case in accordance with the terms of
any agreement between the applicable Continuing Employee and any Acquired
Company.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that, as
of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee receives full credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual, vacation
entitlement and severance benefits for service with the Acquired Companies (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides such past service
credit) under the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in which such employees
are eligible to participate; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical
benefits or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication
of benefits. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of
vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company
Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, with respect to each benefit plan
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation that is an "employee
welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA (each, a "Parent
Welfare Plan") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
such Parent Welfare Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such
Parent Welfare Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents to the same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting
periods, required physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied
or would have been waived under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to his or
her commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan but, with
respect to long-term disability and life insurance benefits and coverage,
solely to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of Parents
applicable insurance contracts in effect as of the Effective Time; provided,
however, that for purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage
includes eligibility conditions based on periods of employment, _Section
6.7(b)_ shall control; and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in
the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee
commences participation in such Parent Welfare Plan in satisfying any
applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Welfare
Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses were
recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Benefit Plan.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor in accordance with their terms all deferred compensation
plans, agreements and arrangements, severance and separation pay plans,
agreements and arrangements, and all written employment, severance, retention,
incentive, change in control and termination agreements (including any change
in control provisions therein) applicable to employees of the Acquired
Companies and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



57 (e) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit
Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not
later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time. In the
event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by
Parent).

(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended
nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or terminating any of
its benefit plans in the ordinary course or otherwise in accordance their
terms, (iii) create a right in any employee to employment with Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any Person with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by
Parent or any Acquired Company or under any benefit plan which Parent, any
Acquired Company or the Surviving Corporation may maintain.

 

Section 6.8. _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
compensation committee of the Company Board (the "Compensation Committee")
will cause each Company Benefit Plan and Company employment agreement pursuant
to which consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is
a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation
Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.9. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Acceptance
Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 6.9(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the
"Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Acceptance Time, which policies provide such persons currently covered by
such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years (6) with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Acceptance Time, including in respect of the Transactions;

 



58  provided, however, that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not
exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such policies in
full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to): (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who at the Acceptance Time is, or at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a
Subsidiary of the Company (each an "Indemnified Party") for any and all costs
and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be
advanced as they are incurred); _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall
have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 6.9(b)_, judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon or
reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising
out of any action, suit or other Legal Proceeding (whether civil or criminal)
in which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or she may
be threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant
other than as a named party, including as a witness) (an "Indemnified Party
Proceeding") (A) by reason of such Indemnified Partys being or having
been such director or officer or an employee or agent of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise in connection with any action taken or
not taken at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
(B) arising out of such Indemnified Partys service in connection with any
other corporation or organization for which he or she serves or has served as
a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of
the Company (including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit
plan), in each of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues
in such position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or
threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the Acceptance Time (including
any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to
the fullest extent that the Company is permitted to so indemnify officers and
directors of the Company under applicable Law; and (ii) fulfill and honor in
all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (x) each
indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof between the Company
and any Indemnified Party; and (y) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses) and any exculpation provision set forth in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect on the
date hereof. If Parent fails to comply with its obligations under this
_Section 6.9(b)_ and any Indemnified Party commences a suit which results in
a determination that Parent failed to comply with such obligation, Parent
shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by Indemnified Parties in connection with their enforcement of their
rights provided under this _Section 6.9_. Parents and the Surviving
Corporations obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Acceptance Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation fails to
comply with its obligations in this _Section 6.9(b)_ and an Indemnified Party
commences a suit which results in a determination that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation failed to comply with such obligation, Parent shall pay such
Indemnified

 



59  Party his or her costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest
thereon at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of payment.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.9_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under any certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 6.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be
Third Party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_).

Section 6.10. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be
necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of shares of
Company Common Stock (including any Company Compensatory Awards) by each
Person who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.11. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable notify Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the
opportunity to (a) participate in the defense and settlement of, any
Transaction Litigation, and (b) consult with counsel to the Company regarding
the defense, settlement or compromise with respect to any such Transaction
Litigation. Without otherwise limiting the Indemnified Parties rights with
regard to the right to counsel, following the Effective Time, the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to continue to retain Goodwin Procter LLP or
such other counsel selected by such Indemnified Parties prior to the
Effective Time to defend any Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this
_Section 6.11_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably
apprised on a prompt basis of proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise adversely affected), and Parent may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the Company
shall consider in good faith; _provided_ that the Company shall not settle or
offer, compromise or agree to settle or compromise any Transaction Litigation
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

the Merger may be abandoned:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time;

 

(b) by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the other at any
time after January 3, 2019 (the "End Date") and prior to the Acceptance Time
if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before the End Date;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party (or any Affiliate of
such party) whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Acceptance Time to have occurred on or before the End
Date; 

(c) by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the other at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time if there shall be any Law enacted after the
date hereof and remaining in effect that makes the acceptance for payment of,
or the payment for, Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger illegal or that prohibits the consummation of the Offer or the Merger,
or any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have
issued a final and nonappealable Order or shall have taken any other action,

final and non-appealable; _provided, however_ , that to the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be
available to any party (or any Affiliate of such party) whose breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the issuance, promulgation, enforcement
or entry of any such Order;

 



61 (d) by Parent or the Company upon prior written notice to the other if the
Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_) expires as
a result of the non-satisfaction of one or more Offer Conditions, or is
terminated or withdrawn prior to the Acceptance Time (to the extent permitted
under the terms of this Agreement), without Merger Sub having accepted for
payment any Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer; _provided,
however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if the non-satisfaction of any Offer
Condition or the termination or withdrawal of the Offer results from the
failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform any covenant
required to be performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such party) at or
prior to the Acceptance Time;

(e) by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time if the Company Board shall have effected a Change in
Recommendation (provided that, any written notice, including pursuant to
_Section 2.3(e)_, of the Companys intention to make a Change in
Recommendation in advance of making an Change in Recommendation shall not
result in Parent having any termination rights pursuant to this _Section
8.1(e)_ unless such written notice otherwise constitutes a Change in
Recommendation); _provided, however_ that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ unless the notice
of termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ is made by Parent to the
Company within ten (10) Business Days following the occurrence of the event
giving rise to Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(e)_ ;

(f) by the Company upon prior written notice to Parent in connection with the
Company Board causing the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal, if the Company and the Company Board
shall have complied in all material respects with the notice, negotiation and
other requirements set forth in _Section 2.3(e)(i)_ with respect to such
Superior Proposal; provided that, concurrent payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.3_ shall be a condition to the right of the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_;

(g) by Parent upon prior written notice to the Company at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty in _Article
4_ or failure to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement on the part of the Company shall have occurred that would cause a
failure of the conditions set forth in clauses "2(c)," "2(d)," and "2(e)" of
_Annex I_ to exist; _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of this 
_Section 8.1(g)_, if such a breach is curable by the Company within twenty
(20) Business Days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach
and the Company is continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(g)_ on account of such breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon
the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period; _provided further_
_,_ _however_ , that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ if either Parent or Merger Sub is in breach
of its obligations under this Agreement such that the Company would be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ ;

(h) by the Company upon prior written notice to Parent at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, if a breach in any material respect of any representation
or warranty or failure to perform in any material respect any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement 

 



62  on the part of Parent or Merger Sub shall have occurred, in each case if
such breach or failure has had or would reasonably be expected to prevent
Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Offer, the Merger or any other
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section
8.1(h)_, if such a breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub within twenty
(20) Business Days of the date the Company gives Parent written notice of
such breach and Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, is continuing to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may
not terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 8.1(h)_ on account of such
breach unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the expiration of such
twenty (20) Business Day period; _provided further_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(h)_ if the Company is in breach of its obligations under this
Agreement such that Parent would be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 8.1(g)_; or

(i) by the Company upon prior written notice to Parent (x) Merger Sub fails to
commence the Offer in accordance with _Section 2.1_ or (y) Merger Sub fails
to consummate the Offer within two (2) Business Days following the Expiration
Date, and as of such Expiration Date all the other conditions have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the time Merger Sub consummates the Offer, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(i)_ shall
not be available to the Company if the Company is in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
that has been the cause of, or resulted in, Merger Subs failure to commence
the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (x) of
this _Section 8.1(i)_ shall not be available to the Company if it fails to
send such notice within ten (10) Business Days of becoming aware of the right
to do so.

 

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect without liability of any party (or any representative
of such party) to each other party hereto; _provided, however,_ that: (a) this
_Section 8.2_, _Article 1_ and the applicable definitions elsewhere in this
Agreement, the last sentence of _Section 6.4_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article 9_
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force
and effect; and (b) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any
party from any liabilities or damages arising out of its knowing or
intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement
delivered in connection herewith or any fraud, subject only, with respect to
any such liabilities of the Company, to _Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section
8.3(c)_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to satisfy
its obligation to accept for payment or pay for Company Common Stock or the
Company Compensatory Awards following satisfaction of the Offer Conditions,
and any failure of Parent to cause the Merger to be effected following
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ , will be deemed to
constitute an intentional and material breach of a covenant of this Agreement.
The parties rights and remedies under the Confidentiality Agreement
shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement.

 



63 Section 8.3. _Expenses; Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Offer and Merger are consummated.

 

(b) If: (i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or  _Section 8.1(d)_, (B) following the date
hereof and prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced, made or delivered to
the Company and (C) the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal (with all
references to 20% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal being treated as
50% for purposes of this clause "(i)") (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal) within twelve (12) months after such termination or the Company
enters into a definitive agreement within twelve (12) months after such
termination to effect an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal); (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.1(e)_; (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_, or (iv) if the Company willfully or materially
breaches its obligations under  _Section 6.2_, then in the case of each of
clauses "(i)" through "(iv)," the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to
Parent, in cash at the time specified in the next sentence, a termination fee
in the amount of $5,580,000 (the "Termination Fee"). Any Termination Fee
shall be paid: (x) in the case of clause "(i)" of the preceding sentence of
this _Section 8.1(b)_, upon the earlier of entry into the agreement for, or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Acquisition
Proposal, (y) in the case of clause "(ii)" of the preceding sentence of this
_Section 8.1(b)_, within two (2) Business Days following termination of this
Agreement and (z) in the case of clause "(iii)" of the preceding sentence of
this _Section 8.1(b)_, concurrently with a termination of this Agreement
under _Section 8.1(f)_ (or no later than on the next Business Day if such
termination occurs on a day that is not a Business Day).

Any Termination Fee due under this  _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Termination Fee shall be payable only
once and not in duplication even though the Termination Fee may be payable
under one or more provisions hereof. In the event that Parent shall become
entitled to payment of the Termination Fee, the receipt of the Termination Fee
shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates
or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the Offer and the Merger (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or
any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions or any matters
forming the basis for such termination. Each of the parties acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this  _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a
reasonable amount that shall compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the
circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement

 



64  and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the Company and Parent would not enter into this
Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee
when due, Parent shall be entitled to receive interest on such
unpaid Termination Fee, commencing on the date that the Termination Fee
became due, at a rate equal to the "prime rate" as published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment (calculated daily on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed, compounded monthly) and in the
event Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the Company for the Termination Fee (or portion thereof), the Company shall
pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit.

Section 9.8. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in

court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior

more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 9.10. _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply
in all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger, and the other Transactions. As a material inducement to the Companys
willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations
hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full performance and
payment by Merger Sub of each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings
required to be performed by Merger Sub under this Agreement and the
Transactions, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in
this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such
breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance
of any such covenant, obligation,

 



68  agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach
or default of Parent, and the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its
sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising
out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of
Parent and Merger Sub in the first instance. As applicable, references in this
_Section 9.10_ to "Merger Sub" shall also include the Surviving Corporation

beneficially owned by Parent and its Affiliates (excluding any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been received), represent one more than 50% of the sum of (x)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the time of
the expiration of the Offer, plus (y) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock then issuable to holders of Company Options from which

waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws

as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such representation
and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case
such representation and warranty shall not have been true and correct as of
such earlier date), except where the failure of any such representation or
warranty to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect; (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ (Due Organization), _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ (Absence of
Changes),  _Section_ __ _ 4.17_ (Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement),

(Brokers) shall not have been true and correct in all material respects as of
the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and
as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such representation
and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case
such representation and warranty shall not have been true and correct in all
material respects as of such earlier date); and (iii) the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _
4.3(a)_ (Capitalization) shall not have been true and correct as of the date
of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of
such date and time, except for _de minimis_ inaccuracies;

 

(d) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material respects
with the obligations or covenants required to be performed by it under the
Agreement and such failure to perform or comply shall not have been cured
prior to the Expiration Date;

(e) the Company shall not have delivered to Parent, dated as of the
Expiration Date, a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior
executive officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth
in the foregoing clauses (2)(c) and (2)(d) have been satisfied as of
immediately prior to the Expiration Date; or

(g) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred and
be continuing any event, change, effect or development that, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Merger Sub; provided
that the Minimum Condition may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub only with
the prior written consent of the Company, which may be granted or withheld in
the Companys sole discretion. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any
time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of
any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may
be asserted in whole or in part at any time and from time to time.

established for the meeting. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this
paragraph may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

The Corporation may, and to the extent required by law, shall, in advance
of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the

entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath
faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and
according to the best of his or her ability. Every vote taken by ballots shall

to therein unless written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to
take action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in the

written consent is so delivered to the Corporation. A telegram, cablegram,
facsimile, e-mail, or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to
be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or
persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to
be written and signed for the purposes of this Section to the extent permitted
by law. Any such consent shall be delivered in accordance with Section

 _Section_ __ _ 1_. _Certificates of Stock_.

 

Each holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to a
certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by any
two authorized officers of the Corporation representing the number of shares
registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the
certificate may be by facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a

_Section_ __ _ 3_.  _Record Date_.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board

which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date
shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action without a meeting, (including by telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission as permitted by law), the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors,
and which record date shall be not more than ten days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted. If no record date has
been fixed by the Board of Directors and no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the record
date shall be the first date on which a consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in the manner
prescribed by Article I, Section 9 hereof. If no record date has been fixed
by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by the Delaware General Corporation Law with respect to the proposed

manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any
notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner
provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

_Section_ __ _ 2_. _Waivers_.

 

A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder or director, or waiver
by electronic transmission by such person, whether given before or after the
time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent
to the notice required to be given to such person. Neither the business nor
the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver.

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as
a director, officer, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an
employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of

officer or trustee, or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the

  Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as
provided in Section 3 of this ARTICLE VIII with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

_Section_ __ _ 2_. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_.

 

In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this
ARTICLE VIII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an
"advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General
Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee
in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity
in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including,
without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication")
that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
this Section 2 or otherwise.

_Section_ __ _ 3_. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_.

 

If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this ARTICLE VIII is not paid in full by
the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in
which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if
successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by
the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be
a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances
because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an

  advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden
of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 4_. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_.

 

The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in
this ARTICLE VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporations Certificate
of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 5_. _Insurance_.

 

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and
any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the Delaware General Corporation Law.

_Section_ __ _ 6_. _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
Corporation_. 

The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 7_. _Nature of Rights_.

 

The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this ARTICLE VIII shall be contract
rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to
be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of this ARTICLE VIII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee
or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate,
or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any
occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took
place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.

_ARTICLE IX - AMENDMENTS _

 

These Bylaws may be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors at any
meeting or by the stockholders at any meeting.
