immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in this Agreement.

take place: (a) at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, no later than the third
(3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible under
applicable Law) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 2475 Hanover Street, Palo Alto,
California 94304; provided, that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or
prior to the time the Closing would have otherwise been required to occur
pursuant to the foregoing, the Closing shall not occur until the earlier to

the State of Delaware or at such later time as the parties shall agree in
writing and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL
(the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 2.6. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any capital
stock of the Company or any other Person:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock (a " _Share_ " or,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares, Converted Shares and
Dissenting Shares (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall at the
Effective Time automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to

shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Shares that

share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 2.7. _Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Article II, and in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying
Agents responsibilities with respect to this Agreement. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or shall cause to be deposited) with the
Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Shares a cash amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose except as set forth herein. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , that
such investments shall be in short-term obligations of, or guaranteed in full
by, the United States of America with maturities no more than thirty (30)
days. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation and any amounts in excess of
the amounts payable under this Article II shall be promptly returned to the
Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to
any such investments, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for
the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration under this Article
II. No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with
the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Shares to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

 



 

(b) Procedures for Surrender.

 



 

(i) _Common Stock Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after
the date on which the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each Record Holder of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (each
such certificate, a " _Certificate_ "), which Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in customary form and
with such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree,
and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) to the Paying Agent in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration for which such Shares have
been converted pursuant the provisions of this Article II. Upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.7(e)) for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant
to the provisions of this Article II in respect of each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or

 



     

 

 



 

accrued on any amount payable in respect of any Shares. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment has paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate and has established to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been
paid or are not required to be paid.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant
to the provisions of this Article II into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration.
In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares
shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and, upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or such
other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver (after giving effect to any required withholding Taxes as
provided in Section 2.7(g)) as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions
of this Article II in respect of each Share formerly represented by such Book-
Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall forthwith be
cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered.

 



 

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.7(b), each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Excluded Shares) shall, from and
after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, as contemplated by Section 2.6(a).
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, such Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of Shares one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent, which
shall remain responsible for payment of the Merger Consideration for such
Shares as provided in this Article II, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other Person

 



     

 

 



 

shall be liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and if required by Parent in its
sole discretion, the posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and
upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
with respect to such Certificate, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares
previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, without
any interest thereon.

 



 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby),
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Cancelled Shares and Converted Shares) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and had become exchangeable for, at
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company
will give Parent (i) reasonably prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices and demands. Parent shall have the right to direct and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands,
withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands; _provided_ that, after
the date hereof until the Effective Time, Parent shall consult with the
Company with respect to such negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Company, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or compromise, or settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any
such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to
comply with Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such Taxes as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making

 



     

 

 



 

of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ ") or under any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.8. _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement between Parent and the holder
thereof, each outstanding option to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") that is fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or would become fully vested and exercisable by the terms of
such Company Stock Option as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (each such Company Stock Option, a " _Vested Company Stock Option_
") shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and, in consideration
thereof, the holder of such Vested Company Stock Option shall receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock
Option, subject to applicable Tax withholding (such amount, the " _Company
Stock Option Consideration_ "). Unless otherwise provided in an agreement
between Parent and the holder thereof, each outstanding Company Stock Option
that is not a Vested Company Stock Option (each such Company Stock Option, an
" _Unvested Company Stock Option_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, be
cancelled and, in consideration thereof, the holder of such Unvested Company
Stock Option will receive the Company Stock Option Consideration, subject to
and conditioned on the same terms and conditions (including any terms and
conditions relating to vesting and acceleration thereof, but excluding any
terms and conditions related to exercise) as applicable to the Unvested
Company Stock Option to which such Company Stock Option Consideration relates,
except as set forth on Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.8(a) to the contrary, any Company
Stock Option that has an exercise price per Share that is greater than or
equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 



 

(b) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement between Parent and the holder
thereof, each outstanding restricted stock unit award (each, a " _Company RSU
Award_ " and, together with the Company Stock Options, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") that is fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (or
would become fully vested by the terms of such Company RSU Award as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for any Executive
Bonus PSU Award) (each such Company RSU Award, a " _Vested Company RSU Award_
") shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and, in consideration
thereof, the holder of such Company RSU Award shall receive an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share subject to such
Company RSU Award, subject to applicable Tax withholding (such amount, the "
_Company RSU Award Consideration_ "). Unless otherwise provided in an
agreement between Parent and the holder thereof, each outstanding Company RSU
Award that is not a Vested Company RSU Award (each such RSU Award, an "
_Unvested Company RSU Award_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled
and, in consideration thereof, the holder of such Unvested Company RSU Award
will receive the Company RSU Award Consideration, subject to and conditioned
on the same terms and conditions (including any terms and conditions relating
to vesting and acceleration thereof) as applicable to the Unvested Company RSU
Award to which such Company RSU

 



     

 

 



 

Award Consideration relates, except as set forth on Section 2.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent any Unvested
Company RSU Award is subject to both time- and performance-vesting
conditions(including any Executive Bonus PSU Award), the applicable
performance-vesting conditions shall be deemed to be satisfied at target
level; provided, further, with respect to any Executive Bonus PSU Award,
except as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Company RSU Award Consideration with respect to such Executive Bonus PSU Award
shall become payable prior to the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date applicable to such Executive Bonus PSU Award. For purposes
hereof, " _Executive Bonus PSU Award_ " means any Company RSU Award that (i)
was granted in 2019, (ii) is subject to both time- and performance-vesting
conditions and (iii) would otherwise fully vest in the ordinary course on the
first anniversary of the vesting commencement date specified in the applicable
award agreement granting such Company RSU Award.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement between Parent and the holder
thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Equity
Awards the cash payments described in Section 2.8(a) and Section 2.8(b) on or
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, in the case of
Vested Company Stock Options and Vested Company RSU Awards, or the applicable
vesting date (or as otherwise provided in Section 2.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable), in the case of Unvested Company Options
and Unvested Company RSU Awards, but in any event within five (5) Business
Days following such applicable date; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any such delivery of the Company
RSU Award Consideration in respect of a Company RSU Award that constitutes
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the earliest possible date that such payment would not trigger a tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or any authorized committee
thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be appropriate or
required in its discretion to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
Section 2.8.

 



 

Section 2.9. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company changes the number
of Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a reclassification, stock
split or reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock distribution,
recapitalization, combination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such change and to provide the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as
so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration.

disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure,
and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission

or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except where the

authority would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (it being acknowledged and agreed that (i) disclosure of any item
in any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, whether or not
an explicit cross reference appears, shall be deemed disclosure with respect
to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, and (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is material or constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
that the inclusion of such item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule is
required), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1. _Organization_. Parent is a limited liability company and Merger
Sub is a corporation, in each case, duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept)
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and each has all
requisite limited liability company, corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted, except where the failure to be in good
standing or to have such limited liability company, corporate or similar power
and authority would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) as a
foreign corporation (or other applicable entity) in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or conduct of
its business requires such qualification or licensing, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
fact, circumstance, change, event, occurrence or effect that, individually or
in the aggregate, materially impairs, materially delays or prevents, or would
reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially delay or prevent,
Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Merger prior to the Termination
Date. Parent has made available to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of the organizational or governing documents of Parent and Merger Sub,
in each case as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Except
as would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is in violation of any provision of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organization documents).

 



 

Section 4.2. _Merger Sub_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 100 shares are validly
issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned indirectly by Parent
(through wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent) free and clear of all Liens.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of the Merger and, prior
to the Effective Time, will have engaged in no other business activities and
will have owned no assets and incurred no liabilities or obligations other
than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and activities
incidental to its formation.

 



 

Section 4.3. _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary actions on the part of each of Parent and Merger
Sub. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub has adopted this Agreement and approved the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and no other actions on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent are necessary to authorize the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming the due and valid authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them
in accordance with its terms, except as limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions.

 



 

Section 4.4. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except as may be
required under, and other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act, the
HSR Act, the North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act, the DGCL, the rules
and regulations of NASDAQ, state securities laws, and foreign and
supranational laws relating to antitrust and competition clearances and other
applicable Regulatory Laws, neither the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub nor the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) contravene,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or similar organizational documents,
of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) require Parent
or Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent to make any notice to, or
filing with, or obtain any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, or (iii) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in clause (ii), contravene, conflict with or
result in a violation or breach of any provision of any applicable Law,
require any consent by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any right or obligation under, or the loss of a benefit under,
any provision of any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent is a party, or result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any asset of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of
Parent, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) and (iii),
as would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.5. _Information Supplied_. None of the written information supplied
or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at
the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or

 



     

 

 



 

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 4.6. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) or any of their properties, rights or assets that
constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There is no Order imposed upon
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or any of their properties, rights or
assets that constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.7. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent is party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter,
dated May 8, 2019 (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from the Lenders pursuant to which the Lenders
have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt
financing in the amounts set forth therein. The debt financing committed
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_."

 



 

(b) Parent is a party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter,
dated May 8, 2019 (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the " _Commitment Letters_ "), from the Equity Investors pursuant to which the
Equity Investors have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
invest in Parent the amounts set forth therein. The cash equity committed
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Cash Equity_." The Cash Equity and the Debt Financing are
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Financing_."

 



 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters and any fee letters related
thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee
and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in connection with
transactions of this type and that could not in any event adversely affect the
availability, conditionality, enforceability or amount of the Financing.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders and the Equity
Investors to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the
Lenders or the Equity Investors to reduce the total amount of the Financing,
including any condition or other contingency relating to the amount or
availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision. As of the
date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all of the terms
and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letters on or
prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent or Merger Sub have knowledge that
any of the Lenders or the Equity Investors will not perform its obligations
thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters,
understandings or other

 



     

 

 



 

agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment
Letters that could adversely affect the availability, conditionality,
enforceability or amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters (other than original issue discount provisions as part of the "flex"
terms in the fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letter).

 



 

(e) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters,
will, together with available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and
other available cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in the
aggregate, provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under
this Agreement and under the Commitment Letters, including the payment of the
Merger Consideration, any payments pursuant to Section 2.8, payment of any
fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness
of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by, or
required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or
the Commitment Letters (such amounts, collectively, the " _Merger Amounts_ ").

 



 

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters constitute the
legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, of all the other parties thereto, except as limited by
the Enforceability Exceptions, and are in full force and effect. As of the
date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which (with or without
notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach or failure to satisfy
a condition by Parent or Merger Sub under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letters, and (ii) assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by Law) of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, on
a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the
Closing Date. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or
before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due
on or before the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, (x) none of the
Commitment Letters has been modified, amended or altered and (y) none of the
respective commitments under any of the Commitment Letters has been withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or
rescission thereof is contemplated. To the Knowledge of Parent, no
modification of, or amendment to, the Commitment Letters is currently
contemplated except for the addition as parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
of Lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar entities who have
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof.

 



 

(g) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.8. _Limited Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, each Equity Investor has delivered to the Company a true, complete
and correct copy of its duly executed Limited Guarantee. Each Limited
Guarantee is (assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
of such Limited Guarantee by the Company) in full force and effect, has not
been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and is the

 



     

 

 



 

legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the applicable Equity
Investor, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of any
Equity Investor under any Limited Guarantee.

 



 

Section 4.9. _Share Ownership_. As of the date hereof and at all times prior
to the time that is immediately prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) is or will be the
beneficial owner of any Shares.

advisor or other similar Person, other than those, the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by Parent or its Affiliates, is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 



 

Section 4.11. _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i) the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, (ii) (a) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
(other than those qualified by materiality or "Company Material Adverse
Effect") are true and correct in all material respects and (b) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement that
are qualified by materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" are true and
correct in all respects, and (iii) any estimates, projections or forecasts of
the Company or its Subsidiaries that have been provided by the Company to
Parent have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were, at
the time made, and continue to be, at the Effective Time, reasonable, after
giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent. For
purposes of this Section 4.11, the term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to
any Person as of a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the
assets, at a fair valuation, of such Person exceeds its debts, (b) such Person
has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts

contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured. For purposes of this Section 4.11, the amount of any
unliquidated or contingent liabilities at any time shall be the maximum amount
which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time,
could reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

any other Person shall be subject to any liability to Parent, Merger Sub or
any other Person resulting from the Companys making available to Parent, its

warranty, express or implied, to Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person with

Section 5.2. _Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their directors, officers, employees, other Affiliates,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or

inquiries, discussions or requests with respect to or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), (ii) engage in or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition

Acquisition Proposal, (v) take any action to make the provisions of any
Takeover Statute or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover

inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or
(vi) authorize, commit to, agree or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the date hereof until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VII
and the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate, amend, release or
modify any provision of any standstill agreement, except that the Company will
not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of
any standstill or confidentiality agreement solely to the extent that such
provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential Acquisition
Proposal being made to the Company or the Company Board (or any committee
thereof).

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on June 7, 2019 (the " _No-Shop Period Start
Date_ "), the Company and its Representatives shall have the right to (A)
initiate or solicit, or knowingly facilitate or encourage, any Inquiry and (B)
engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or, subject to the entry into,
and in accordance with, an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, provide any
access to its properties, books or records or any non-public information to
any Person (and its Representatives and prospective equity and debt financing
sources subject to the terms and conditions of such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement applicable to such Person) relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ that (x) the Company
will provide to Parent any information relating to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to
Parent substantially concurrently with (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours after) the time it is furnished to such Person (and its
Representatives and prospective equity and debt financing sources) and (y) the
Company and its Subsidiaries will not pay, agree to pay or cause to be paid or
reimburse, agree to reimburse or cause to be reimbursed, the expenses of any
such Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposals or Inquiries.

 



 

(ii) On the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent in
writing of (x) the number of parties with which the Company entered into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the number of parties that
submitted an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the No-Shop Period Start Date, which notice shall include a summary of all
material terms of any pending Acquisition Proposals that were made in writing
by any Excluded Party or any other Acquisition Proposal which the Company
Board determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, warranted the Company Boards further discussion.

 



 

(iii) On the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers and employees and shall
instruct its Affiliates and other Representatives to immediately cease all
solicitations, discussions and negotiations with any Persons (other than
Parent and its Representatives and any Excluded Party and its Representatives)
that may be ongoing with respect to an

 



     

 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal and request that each such Person (other than Parent and
its Representatives and any Excluded Party and its Representatives) promptly
return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or
on behalf of the Company in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start
Date and prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the
Company, directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives,
receives a written unsolicited and bona fide Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.2, the Company and its Representatives
may contact the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Proposal, and may (i) provide information to such Person or
group of Persons (including their respective Representatives and prospective
equity and debt financing sources) if the Company receives from such Person or
group of Persons (or has received from such Person or group of Persons) an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms that are not less
favorable in any material respect to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not
contain any standstill or similar provision (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that the Company shall make available to Parent
and Merger Sub any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons which was
not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub substantially
concurrently (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), and
(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person
or group of Persons, if prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or
(ii) above, (A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law. It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures,
discussions or negotiations permitted under this Section 5.2(b), including any
public announcement that the Company or the Company Board has made any
determination required under this Section 5.2(b) to take or engage in any such
actions (provided that the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in connection with such disclosure), shall not
constitute a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(c) or in Section 5.2(d), neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify), in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (2) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (3) adopt, approve or recommend or endorse or otherwise declare
advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, (4) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten
(10) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing following any public
disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal (other than of the type referred to in
the proviso to the following clause (5)) from any Person other than Parent and
Merger Sub (provided that if the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held
within ten (10)

 



     

 

 



 

Business Days from the date of such written request, promptly and in any event
prior to the date which is two (2) Business Days before the date on which the
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held) or (5) fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange
Act, against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer
subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (or if the
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within ten (10) Business Days
from the date of such commencement, promptly and in any event prior to the
date which is two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled to be held) (any of the foregoing, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that any communication made in accordance
with Section 5.2(d)(ii), or the failure by the Company Board to take a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal referred to in the preceding
clause (4) or a tender offer or exchange offer referred to in the preceding
clause (5), shall not be deemed a Change of Recommendation if such
communication is made or such position is taken prior to the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or Parents written
request following the public disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal, as
applicable (or such earlier time as referenced above). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may (x)
effect a Change of Recommendation contemplated by clauses (1) or (2) of the
definition thereof if, upon the occurrence of an Intervening Event, the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law or (y) if the
Company receives, directly or indirectly through one or more of its
Representatives, either (A) after the date hereof and prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date from an Excluded Party an Acquisition Proposal or (B) after
the No-Shop Period Start Date an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, in each of the case of subclauses (A) and (B), that the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal and such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach by the Company of
this Section 5.2, effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a) in order to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, and, in the case
of either clause (x) or (y):

 



 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three (3) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_ ") and/or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a), which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for the Change of Recommendation and/or
termination and (A) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and the material
terms thereof along with a copy of any proposed agreement in respect of such
Superior Proposal (or, if there is no such proposed agreement, a written
summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal); or
(B) in the case of an Intervening Event, reasonable detail regarding the
Intervening Event;

 



 

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation and/or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a),
the

 



     

 

 



 

Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to be
available to negotiate, with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the
extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during such three (3)
Business Day period to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would obviate the need for the Company to effect a Change of
Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a); and

 



 

(iii) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and, with respect to clause (A) below, its financial advisor,
taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent in response to the Notice of Change of Recommendation, that (A) the
Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Change of Recommendation
continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening
Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation
would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law.

 



 

Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material change to the terms
of a Superior Proposal shall require the Company to deliver a new Notice of
Change of Recommendation and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of clauses (i)-(iii) above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the No-Shop Period Start Date, references to the three (3) Business
Day period above shall then be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business
Day period following receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change of
Recommendation.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable
Law or NASDAQ, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to stockholders) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to stockholders of the
Company, including any such similar communication in response to an
Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer); _provided_
, _however_ , that (x) except as provided in the next sentence, any disclosure
made as permitted under clause (i) of this Section 5.2(d) (other than any
"stop-look-and-listen" or similar communication) that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless
the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in
connection with such disclosure, and (y) neither the Company nor the Company
Board (nor any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (including that the stockholders of the Company tender
any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is
an Acquisition Proposal) or otherwise effect a Change of Recommendation with
respect thereto, except as permitted by Section 5.2(c). It is understood and
agreed that any "stop-look-and-listen" or similar communication permitted
under clause (ii) of this Section 5.2(d) made prior to the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, if earlier, no
fewer than two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which the Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled to be held) shall not constitute

 



     

 

 



 

a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4. The Company shall in no
event be deemed to violate this Section 5.2 as a result of responding (x)
prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, to any Inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal, or (y) from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, to any
unsolicited proposal or inquiry, in each case, solely by advising the Person
making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 5.2.

 



 

(e) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent in writing if, from and after the date hereof, any
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (including any request for non-public
information in connection therewith) is received by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, indicating (except to the
extent prohibited by applicable Law or Contract in effect as of the date
hereof) the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal, Inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal (including, if applicable, providing copies of any
written Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall (x) promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing (i) if the Company
determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in
negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Proposal in accordance
with this Section 5.2 and (ii) thereafter of any change to the financial and
other material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal, and (y)
otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of
any such Inquiry, Acquisition Proposal, discussions or negotiations on a
reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all proposals,
offers or drafts of proposed agreements. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing
such information to Parent.

 



 

Section 5.3. _Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof), the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to
the Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), and each of the Company and Parent shall,
or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare and file with the SEC
all other documents required by the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent and the Company
shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and any such other filings. Except as permitted by Section
5.2, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation; _provided_
, that if the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.2, then in submitting this Agreement to the
Companys stockholders, the Company Board may submit this Agreement to the
Companys stockholders without the Company Recommendation, in which event the
Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation to the
Companys stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment
thereof or supplement thereto. Parent agrees to provide or cause to be
provided all information with respect to itself, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives as may be reasonably requested by the Company for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and any such other filings.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Each party shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the other
parties of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable provide to the other party copies of all written correspondence
with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except in the case of a Non-Objection, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly provide
responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy
Statement from the SEC and to make any amendments or filings as may be
necessary in connection therewith and (ii) have the Proxy Statement cleared by
the SEC staff as soon as reasonably practical after such filing. The Company
shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as
reasonably practicable after a Non-Objection or the date the SEC staff advises
that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(c) Subject to applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall (unless and until a Change of Recommendation has
occurred or in connection with the matters described in Section 5.2) provide
Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on (which comments shall be
made promptly) such document or response and shall consider in good faith
including in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

 



 

(d) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, should be
set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that
the Proxy Statement would not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this
Section 5.3(d) shall limit the rights or obligations of any party under any
other paragraph of this Section 5.3.

 



 

(e) All documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.4. _Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 5.3, the Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all action
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of holders
of Shares (including any adjournment or postponement thereof as permitted by
this Section 5.4, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable following clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC or a Non-

 



     

 

 



 

Objection, to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the Company may postpone or adjourn to a later date the
Stockholders Meeting (i) with the written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the
absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies if the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, whether
or not a quorum is present, (iv) if required by applicable Law or (v) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and dissemination of any
supplemental or amended disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel), the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall the Stockholders Meeting be postponed or adjourned beyond the date that
is five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date without the prior
written consent of Parent. Unless there has been a Change of Recommendation
pursuant to Section 5.2, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
lawfully obtain the Stockholder Approval, including actively soliciting
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders
Meeting. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any other Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(b) The Company shall keep Parent informed with respect to proxy solicitation
results as reasonably requested by Parent and shall provide such information
and reasonable cooperation as Parent may reasonably request in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
remain obligated to provide the information and cooperation described in the
immediately preceding sentence and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Stockholders Meeting and mail the Proxy Statement (and any amendment or
supplement thereto that maybe required by applicable Law) to the Companys
stockholders in accordance with Section 5.3 and this Section 5.4,
notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation.

 



 

Section 5.5. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or to cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other in doing (and, in the case of Parent, to use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Equity Investors and their Affiliates to assist and cooperate as
necessary or appropriate with the other parties), all things necessary, proper
or advisable under this Agreement or applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including to (i) obtain from any Governmental Entities and any
third parties any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents,
approvals, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, permits or orders
required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) make all registrations, filings, notifications or
submissions which are necessary or advisable with respect to this Agreement
and the Merger under (A) any applicable federal or state securities Law, (B)
the HSR Act and any other applicable Regulatory Law and (C) any other
applicable Law, (iii) defend against any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the

 



     

 

 



 

consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to
the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party
to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger
under any Contract; _provided_ , _further_ , that without the prior written
consent of Parent, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall pay or
commit to pay to any third party whose consent or approval is being solicited
any amount of cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation in connection therewith (in each case of this
proviso other than filing fees in connection with the actions described in the
preceding clause (ii), reimbursements for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by any such third party in connection with obtaining its
consent or approval, or de minimis cash or other consideration).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all
obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or
any other financing for the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed
exclusively by Sections 5.12 and 5.13, and not this Section 5.5.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of this Section 5.5, each party
hereto agrees to make, or cause to be made, an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), to make, or
cause to be made, all filings and authorizations, if any, required under any
other applicable Regulatory Law set forth on Section 5.5(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, and to supply, or cause to be supplied, as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and material that may be requested by a
Governmental Entity pursuant to any Regulatory Law. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the parties shall request and use reasonable best
efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
and no party shall agree to extend any waiting period under any Regulatory Law
applicable to or commit not to consummate any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of all other parties.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of this Section 5.5, the Company
shall (and cause its Subsidiaries to) and Parent shall (and cause its
Subsidiaries to) and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law. If any Action,
including any Action by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
any Regulatory Law, the Company shall (and cause its Subsidiaries to), Parent
shall (and cause its Subsidiaries to) and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all
respects and use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that
restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by pursuing all reasonable avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
party shall, and, in the case of the Company or Parent, shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to, (x) negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and (y) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that
after the Closing Date

 



      

 

 



 

limit Parents or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations)
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more
businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation), in each case as may be required in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, materially delaying
the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the Termination Date; _provided_ ,
that the Company will only be required to take or commit to take any such
action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action,
commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company only
if and when the Closing occurs.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of this Section 5.5, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) subject to any restrictions under any
Regulatory Law, promptly notify each other of any communication to that party
from any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby and permit the other
parties to review in advance any proposed material communication to any
Governmental Entity, (ii) unless required by applicable Law, not agree to
participate in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby unless
it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend
and participate thereat, (iii) subject to any restrictions under any
Regulatory Law, furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence,
filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions and other agreements
contemplated hereby (excluding any documents and communications which are
subject to the attorney-client privilege or other privilege or trade secret
protection or the work product doctrine), and (iv) furnish the other parties
with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
parties may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of
necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions and
other agreements contemplated hereby and thereby, including any filings
necessary or appropriate under the provisions of any Regulatory Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties may, as each deems advisable,
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided under this
Section 5.5 or any other section of this Agreement as "outside counsel only
material". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, privileged communications,
or other competitively sensitive material.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Access and Reports_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from and after the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon
reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and each of their
Representatives (including, to the extent requested by Parent, the Lenders),
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to its officers, employees,
properties, offices and other facilities, books, Contracts and records;
_provided_ , that (i) the foregoing shall not require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to permit access to (A) any inspection or any information
that

 



     

 

 



 

would violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality in effect
as of the date hereof, (B) any information that is subject to attorney-client
privilege or other privilege or trade secret protection or the work product
doctrine, (C) information that in the reasonable opinion of the Company would
result in a breach of a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are bound as of the date hereof or (D) information related to the
Companys sale process, including any information related to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement or to transactions potentially competing with
or alternative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or proposals
from other third parties relating to any competing or alternative transactions
(including Acquisition Proposals) and the actions of the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) with respect to any of the foregoing, whether prior to or
after execution of this Agreement (access to the information described in this
clause (D) shall be governed by Section 5.2), (ii) any such investigation
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise
result in any undue burden with respect to the prompt and timely discharge by
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties and (iii)
no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein; _provided_ ,
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for any access
or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the effects set out in
clauses (i)(A), (i)(B) or (i)(C), including by making appropriate substitute
arrangements.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives and Affiliates to, hold and treat in confidence all documents
and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to
Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Representatives, financing sources or
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with that certain letter agreement, dated February 6, 2019,
between Parent and the Company (as amended or otherwise modified from time to
time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") as if all such documents and
information were Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement), which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
and shall apply to Parent and Merger Sub as if they were direct parties
thereto.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any Actions commenced against such party or any
of its Affiliates in connection with, arising from or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction
Litigation_ ") or (iii) if such party becomes aware of the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
hereto to effect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.6(c) shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to any party hereto.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 5.7. _Publicity; Communications_. The initial press release regarding
the Merger shall be a joint press release by the Company and Parent and
thereafter (unless and until a Change of Recommendation has occurred or in
connection with the matters described in Section 5.2) each party shall consult
with the other parties, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment, prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements or filings with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with NASDAQ (in which
case, such party shall, to the extent practicable, use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other parties before issuing such press release or
making such public announcement or filing).

 



 

Section 5.8. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary
to, provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues in
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
with (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage (whichever is applicable) and a
short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity, that, in each case, is not
less than the base salary or regular hourly wage and short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunity in effect for, or available to, the applicable
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
other compensation opportunities (excluding any equity award, other long-term
compensation opportunities, contributions to any employer stock fund in any
Company 401(k) Plan or other contributions to any Company 401(k) Plan in
Common Stock) and employee benefits (excluding any severance-related benefits)
that are, in each case, substantially similar in the aggregate to the other
compensation (excluding any equity award, other long-term compensation
opportunities, contributions to any employer stock fund in any Company 401(k)
Plan or other contributions to any Company 401(k) Plan in Common Stock) and
employee benefits (excluding any severance-related benefits), respectively,
provided or available to the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation hereby expressly assumes the Company Benefit Plans and agrees to
perform the obligations of the Company thereunder in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof.

 



 

(b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
with severance benefits and on terms and conditions, in each case, that are no
less favorable than the severance benefits and protections provided to each
such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time as set
forth in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are entitled to participate
after the Closing Date to take into account for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan or as would result in a duplication of benefits), service
prior to the Effective Time by such employees to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any predecessors) as if such service were with Parent or its
Subsidiaries.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Continuing Employees following the Closing
Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations or waiting period requirements with respect to any such
plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee to the same extent waived under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) give effect, in determining
any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to any
eligible expenses paid by such employees during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs (or such later date on which a Continuing Employee
commences participation in any new plan of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) under analogous Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(e)

 



 

(i) The Company shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, make
commercially reasonable best efforts and in satisfaction of its fiduciary
duties under ERISA to amend any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to
qualify as a profit sharing plan with a cash or deferred arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_"), effective not
later than the Closing, but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing, to
(A) cease offering the employer stock fund invested in the Common Stock (the "
_Stock Fund_ ") as an investment option under the Company 401(k) Plans, (B)
"map" each participants investment election with respect to future
contributions in the Stock Fund to such investments as the appropriate
fiduciary of each Company 401(k) Plan determines and provide that employer
contributions (including employer matching contributions) shall thereafter be
invested in accordance with each participants investment elections, and (C)
cause amounts then invested in the Stock Fund to be re-invested in such manner
as the appropriate fiduciary of each Company 401(k) Plan determines such that,
from and after the Closing, no portion of any participants account under the
Company 401(k) Plan will be invested in the Stock Fund (collectively, the "
_Stock Fund Termination_ ").

 



 

(ii) Without limiting Section 5.8(e)(i), (A) in the event the Company
determines that the Stock Fund Termination cannot be completed or (B) upon
written request by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date (which request may be made by Parent, in its discretion, regardless of
whether the Stock Fund Termination can be completed), the Company shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, adopt resolutions terminating or
amending each Company 401(k) Plan, effective as of one day preceding the
Closing Date, but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing.

 



 

(iii) Prior to Closing, the Company shall provide Parent evidence that each
Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated and/or amended, as applicable, in
accordance with this Section 5.8(e), pursuant to duly adopted resolutions, and
that all other actions necessary to implement the foregoing have been taken at
least one day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of any such
resolutions and any related documentation, including plan amendments and
participant notifications (if applicable),

 



     

 

 



 

shall be subject to review and reasonable approval of Parent and shall be
provided to Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no
event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms after the Closing Date. Without limiting Section
8.9, nothing in this Section 5.8 shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Continuing Employee or current or former service provider of the
Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

(g) Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, pay to each
Continuing Employee who remains employed through December 31, 2019 (whether or
not employed on the payment date), an annual incentive bonus in respect of
2019, payable no later than February 29, 2020, equal to the bonus that such
employee would have earned based upon actual performance through December 31,
2019; _provided_ , _however_ , that actual performance shall be determined in
a manner that is consistent with the Companys past practice and shall exclude
any costs and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any nonrecurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to
have been incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not occurred.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
each Limited Guarantee, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, except that all filing fees under the HSR Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
by Parent.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each fiduciary
of a Company Benefit Plan (collectively, together with such persons heirs,
executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of, related to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether
prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection with such
Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of

 



     

 

 



 

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or a fiduciary of a Company Benefit
Plan or services performed by such persons at the request of or for the
benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification, exculpation or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
shall, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, cause the Charter and
the Bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties
with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities and rights to
advancement of expenses than those set forth as of the date of this Agreement
in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall advance costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) as
incurred by any Indemnified Party promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
days) after receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined (after exhausting all available appeals) that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 5.10(a), upon learning of any claim,
action or proceeding in respect of which such indemnification will be sought,
shall notify the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing; _provided_ , that
the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not affect the
indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent under this
Section 5.10(a), except to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pre-pay
the premium for (and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain with
reputable and financially sound carriers) the extension of (i) the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case
for a claims reporting or discovery period (whichever is greater) of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim arising from
facts or events that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies in effect on the date hereof. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage
limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, purchase comparable insurance as the DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable as the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event
shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for any
such policies pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) an annual premium amount in
excess of 300% of the

 



     

 

 



 

aggregate of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance, and (y) if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such maximum amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for such maximum amount.

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that such surviving or
acquiring Person(s), as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.10.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.10 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, under any applicable Contracts or Laws or otherwise.
All rights to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the
Effective Time) as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Contract or otherwise between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect (and shall be so maintained) and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Indemnified
Party, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in
this Section 5.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims
under any such policies.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions of equity
securities (including derivative securities) of the Company in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who
is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and shall use reasonable best efforts to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained
in any related fee letter) as promptly as possible (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) but in any event on or prior to the
date upon which the Merger is

 



     

 

 



 

required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including by using
reasonable best efforts with respect to (i) causing the Equity Investors to
maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) maintaining in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiating and entering into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_
") consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any
related fee letter) or, if available, on other terms that (A) are acceptable
to Parent in its sole discretion, (B) would not reasonably be expected to
delay (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or
adversely affect the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and (C) would otherwise be permitted by Section 5.12(b),
and (iv) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period,
satisfying (or, if reasonably required to obtain the Financing, seeking the
waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Definitive Agreements that are within the control of Parent or Merger Sub
and complying with its obligations thereunder. In the event that all
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements (other than the consummation of the Merger and other than the
availability of the Cash Equity and those that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders thereunder to
comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to fund the
Debt Financing (including, subject to Section 8.7(c), by promptly commencing a
litigation proceeding against any breaching Lender or other financial
institution to compel such Lender or financial institution to provide its
portion of the Debt Financing or otherwise comply with its obligations under
the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements). Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with its respective
obligations, and enforce its respective rights, under the Commitment Letters
and Definitive Agreements in a timely and diligent manner.

 



 

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, without the prior
written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment or modification to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification or waiver (A) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the
Financing, (B) reduces the amount of the Financing to an amount that, together
with available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and other available
cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, would on the Closing Date
be less than the Merger Amounts, (C) adversely affects in a material respect
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (D) could otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period);
or (ii) terminate any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement unless
such Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreement is replaced at such time with a
new commitment letter or a new definitive agreement that would satisfy the
preceding clause (i). Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of any
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will (i) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with Cash Equity and the available portion of
the Debt Financing, the available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and
other available funds or cash to Parent and its Subsidiaries, to pay the
Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts) as promptly as reasonably
practicable from the same or other sources on terms and conditions that are
not less favorable to Parent and its Subsidiaries than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and
which do not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative
debt financing that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of such
alternative debt financing less likely to occur, than the conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof (and, when obtained,
provide the Company with a true and correct copy of any new financing
commitment for such alternative debt financing) and (ii) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include
any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative
or replacement financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt
Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent and

of their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Financing is available.

(provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries),

meetings with prospective lenders), presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, at reasonable times and with
reasonable advance notice, (ii) executing and delivering Definitive Agreements

required by paragraph 6 in Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter (such

shall state

information regarding the Company as is readily available to the Company at
such time and is customarily required in connection with the execution of
financings of a type similar to the Debt Financing, (iv) if requested by
Parent, using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in connection with
Parents preparation of customary pro forma financial statements as required

otherwise that are customary in the Debt Financing) and other customary
marketing materials required in connection with financings similar to the Debt
Financing, (B) materials for rating agency presentations and (C) definitive
documentation for the Debt Financing, (vi) following Parents reasonable
request, using reasonable best efforts to cause directors and officers who
will continue to hold such offices and positions from and after the Effective

that do not become effective until the Effective Time with respect to entering
into the definitive documentation for the Debt Financing and otherwise as
necessary to authorize consummation of the Debt Financing, and (vii) if

its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the
execution of the Debt Financing that is effective prior to the Effective Time
or execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement

any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (E) conflict with the
organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Laws, (F)
reasonably be expected to result (with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both) in a material violation or breach of, or a default under, any Contract

commercially reasonable efforts or (I) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any instrument or agreement (other than the
authorization and representation letters referred to in clause (v)(A) above)
that is effective prior to the Effective Time or that would be effective if
the Closing does not occur. Nothing contained in this Section 5.13 or
otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the
Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
following termination of this Agreement for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this
Section 5.13 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all

information provided in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries
specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.13).

 



 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in this Section 5.13, represent the sole obligation
of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with
respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing
(including the Financing) to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed
to expand or modify such obligations. In no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing) by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parents or
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 5.13 shall be kept confidential and otherwise treated in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement or other confidentiality obligations that
are substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(which, with respect to the Lenders, shall be satisfied by the confidentiality
provisions applicable thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter if made for the
benefit of the Company). The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the
Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing, so long as
the Company has a reasonable opportunity to preview such use of logos and such
logos (i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to
harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) are used solely in
connection with a description of the Company, its business and products or the
Merger (including in connection with any marketing materials related to the
Debt Financing); and (iii) are displayed and presented in a manner consistent
with the Companys past practices.

Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep the other reasonably
informed on a current basis with respect to any Transaction Litigation,

regarding such Transaction Litigation and give each other the opportunity to
participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation; _provided_ that the Company shall in any event control such
defense, settlement or prosecution, and the disclosure of information in
connection therewith shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.6,
including regarding attorney client privilege or other privilege or trade
secret protection or the work product doctrine; _provided_ , _further_ , that
no such party or Representative of such party shall compromise, settle, come
to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless
the Company, in the case of any such action by Parent or Merger Sub, or
Parent, in the case of any such action by the Company, shall have consented in
writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Without otherwise limiting rights with regard to the right to
counsel, following the Effective Time, all members of the Company Board who
are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to
continue to retain Goodwin Procter LLP or such other counsel selected by such
Persons prior to the Effective Time to defend any Transaction Litigation;
_provided_ , that such representation is accepted by the Companys director
and officer insurance carriers.

 



 

Section 5.15. _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, except as otherwise
may be agreed by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Parent the resignation of all members of the Company Board who are

effective as of immediately prior to (but conditioned on the occurrence of)
the Effective Time.

necessary to ensure that the Merger or any such transaction may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute or
similar restriction on the Merger or such other transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Takeover Statute_ " shall mean a "fair price,"

as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (i) Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or the Equity
Investors to, (A) amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision of their
respective organizational or governing documents in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (B) take
any action or fail to take any action which is intended to or which would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay or impede the ability of any of the parties hereto to obtain

the transactions contemplated hereby, to perform its covenants and agreements
under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or

any necessary approvals or clearances of any Governmental Entity required for
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub do not consummate the Merger on or prior to the

parties in accordance with Section 8.6, specifying the provision or provisions
hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.2(a), Section
7.2(b) or Section 7.4(b) (provided that with respect to Section 7.2(a) and
Section 7.4(b), the Stockholder Approval has not been obtained); (B) any

_provided_ , that if both (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and (B) the
Company has entered into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
an Excluded Party to consummate an Acquisition Proposal at the time of such
termination, then the Company Termination Fee shall equal $10,197,027; or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(a), the
Company shall, no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such

Section 8.7. _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them in order to consummate
the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach or
threaten to breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties hereto shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, except
as expressly provided in Section 8.7(b) or 8.7(c).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.7(a), it is acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance of Parents and Merger Subs
obligations pursuant to the

 



     

 

 



 

terms of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter to complete the
Closing, including to cause, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter, the Cash Equity to be funded to fund the Merger
and to consummate the Merger, only in the event that (i) all of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
_provided_ that those other conditions would be satisfied if the Closing were
on such date), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the
date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (iii)
the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Cash Equity is funded at the Closing, and (iv) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in a written notice to Parent that the Closing will occur if the
Cash Equity and Debt Financing are funded and specific performance is granted
pursuant to this Section 8.7(b).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding Section 8.7(a), it is acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance requiring Parent and Merger
Sub to enforce (x) the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and (y) the
obligations of the Lenders to fund the Debt Financing, only in the event that
(i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, _provided_ that those other conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing were on such date), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail
to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 1.2, (iii) all of the conditions (other than those

satisfied if the Closing were on such date) to the consummation of the

not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law or (ii)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any party seeking an order or injunction to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

amounts of monetary damages for Willful Breach of this Agreement and the
Parent Termination Fee, in each case paid by or on behalf of Parent, exceed
the amount of the Damage Cap, and (y) upon termination of this Agreement and
payment of such amounts, no member of the Parent Group shall have any further
liability or obligation to any holder of Shares or Company Equity Awards or
the Company on behalf of such holders relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or each Limited Guarantee, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

related to the Debt Financing that expressly specifies that the interpretation
of such provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in
