NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and consideration set

ARTICLE I 
PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTION; THE CLOSING; TRANSACTION PRICE ADJUSTMENT;
ESCROW RELEASE

1.01 Purchase and Sale of the Blocker Stock and the Company Interests. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, (a)
the Purchaser shall purchase from each Blocker Seller, and each Blocker Seller
shall sell to the Purchaser, all of the Blocker Stock owned by such Blocker
Seller, and (b) the Purchaser shall purchase from AQ Seller, and AQ Seller
shall sell to the Purchaser, all of the Company Interests other than the
Blocker Interests, in exchange for the consideration specified in Section
1.02.

1.02 Closing Cash Proceeds.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a completed copy of Schedule I and
a written statement setting forth the Sellers' good faith estimate of Closing
Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), Closing
Indebtedness (the "Estimated Indebtedness"), Closing Cash (the "Estimated
Cash") and Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses") based
on the Company's books and records and other information available at the
Closing and calculated on a basis consistent with the definitions of Closing
Net Working Capital (including Exhibit 1.02(a)), Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Transaction Expenses and in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied. During such period, the Purchaser shall be entitled to review the
calculation of such estimates, and the Company shall permit the Purchaser and
its representatives to have reasonable access to the books and records
pertaining to the preparation of such estimates; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company's estimates delivered pursuant to this Section
1.02(a) shall be used to determine the Closing Cash Proceeds.

(b) As used herein, "Closing Cash Proceeds" means (i) Two Hundred and Fifty
Million Dollars ($250,000,000.00) (the "Transaction Price"), minus (ii) the
amount of Estimated Indebtedness, minus (iii) the Escrow Amount, minus (iv)
the Representative Expense Holdback Amount, minus (v) the amount of Estimated
Transaction Expenses, plus (vi) the amount of Estimated Cash, plus (vii) the
amount, if any, by which Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds Target Net
Working Capital, and minus (viii) the amount, if any, by which Target Net
Working Capital exceeds Estimated Net Working Capital.

1.03 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place electronically via email and/or
facsimile (provided that if the Purchaser and the Representative mutually
agree to a physical closing then the Closing shall occur on the Closing Date
at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, located at 300 North LaSalle Street,
Chicago, Illinois 60654) at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, on the third (3rd)
Business Day following full satisfaction or due waiver (by the party entitled
to the benefit of such condition) of the closing conditions set forth in
ARTICLE IX (other than conditions that by their terms or nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing). The date the Closing actually occurs is referred to
herein as the "Closing Date." On the Business Day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, the Company, each of the Sellers, each of the Blocker Corps and
the Purchaser shall conduct a pre-Closing, commencing at 10:00 a.m. Central
Time, at which the Company, each of the Sellers, each of the Blocker Corps and
the Purchaser shall



present (via email or facsimile) for review by the other parties copies in
execution form of all documents required to be delivered by such party at the
Closing.

1.04 The Closing Transactions. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following
transactions at the Closing.

(a) The Purchaser shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company
or AQ Seller, all amounts necessary to release the Liens upon the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Funded Indebtedness as set forth in
lien release letters with respect to such Funded Indebtedness (the "Release
Letters") delivered to the Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date which Release Letters will provide that upon receipt by the
lenders of the amounts set forth in each such Release Letter, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall have no further obligations with respect to the
applicable Funded Indebtedness, such amounts to be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated to the Purchaser
prior to the Closing by the holders of such Funded Indebtedness in the Release
Letters.

(b) The Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the Escrow Amount
in the Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing to the Purchaser prior to the Closing by the
Escrow Agent.

(c) The Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent
for the benefit of the Representative, the Representative Expense Holdback
Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing to the Purchaser prior to the Closing by the Paying
Agent.

(d) The Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the Sellers, the Closing Cash Proceeds less the
amount (the "Payoff Amount"), if any, by which the amount delivered in respect
of Funded Indebtedness pursuant to Section 1.04(a) exceeds Estimated
Indebtedness, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing to the Purchaser prior to the Closing by the Paying
Agent, such Closing Cash Proceeds to be delivered by the Paying Agent to each
Seller in accordance with such Seller's respective percentage set forth
opposite such Seller's name on the attached Schedule I (such Seller's
"Allocation Percentage") based on a schedule provided to the Paying Agent by
the Representative (with the portion of Closing Cash Proceeds distributable to
AQ Seller being reduced by the Payoff Amount).

(e) AQ Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a duly executed assignment
instrument transferring the Company Interests, other than the Blocker
Interests, to the Purchaser.

(f) Each Blocker Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser certificates, if
applicable, duly endorsed in blank or with duly executed transfer powers
attached or duly executed transfer instruments representing all of the issued
and outstanding Blocker Stock of the Blocker Corp set forth opposite such
Blocker Seller's name on the attached Schedule I (or, in the case of any lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates with respect to any shares of Blocker Stock,
an affidavit of lost certificate with respect to such shares of Blocker
Stock).



(g) The Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company or
AQ Seller, all Estimated Transaction Expenses to each Person who is owed a
portion thereof as identified in writing, together with wire instructions, by
the Company to the Purchaser prior to the Closing.

(h) The Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers shall make such other
deliveries as are required by ARTICLE IX.

1.05 Transaction Price Adjustments.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Representative (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of the
time of the Closing on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), which
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (provided that
the Closing Balance Sheet need not contain footnote disclosures), and (ii) a
statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the Purchaser's calculation
of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Transaction Expenses on a basis consistent with the definitions of Closing Net
Working Capital (including Exhibit 1.02(a)), Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Transaction Expenses and in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet and determining Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses pursuant to this Section 1.05 is to
measure changes (if any) in the amounts of Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses from the
respective amounts estimated pursuant to Section 1.02(a) in order to determine
the Purchaser Adjustment Amount or Seller Adjustment Amount, as the case may
be, and that such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
principles, policies, practices, procedures, methodologies, classifications,
methods, conventions, assumptions, judgments or estimation techniques in
preparing the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement (or the amounts
set forth therein), as the case may be, that are different from those used in
the determination of the respective amounts estimated pursuant to Section
1.02(a) or that are not in accordance with GAAP consistently applied or as set
forth on Exhibit 1.02(a). If the Closing Statement is not delivered to the
Representative within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, then the
Company's estimates delivered pursuant to Section 1.02(a) shall constitute the
amounts for Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and Transaction Expenses and shall be final and binding upon, and
non‑appealable, by the parties hereto.

(b) During the sixty (60) days immediately following the Representative's
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement and any period
of dispute thereafter (as described in Section 1.05(c)) with respect to such
Closing Balance Sheet or Closing Statement, the Company and the Purchaser
shall reasonably assist the Representative and its representatives in the
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including by
furnishing on a timely basis all information requested in writing by the
Representative or its representatives necessary or useful in connection with
such review and provide the Representative and its representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the books, records (including work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities
and relevant personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including Company
personnel responsible for



accounting and finance, senior management and the Company's accountants and
advisors) for purposes of their review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement. The Purchaser agrees that following the Closing it will
not, and it will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any
actions with respect to the books, records, policies and procedures of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would obstruct or prevent the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement, or the
Representative's review of the foregoing, in each case, as provided in this
Section 1.05.

(c) If the Representative disagrees with any part of the Purchaser's
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and Transaction Expenses as set forth in the Closing Statement, the
Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after the Representative's
receipt of the Closing Statement, notify the Purchaser in writing of such
disagreement by setting forth the Representative's calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses
(an "Objection Notice"). If an Objection Notice is not delivered to the
Purchaser within sixty (60) days after the Representative's receipt of the
Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon, and
non-appealable by, the parties hereto. During the fifteen (15) days
immediately following the delivery of an Objection Notice, or such longer
period as the Representative and the Purchaser may agree in writing, the
Representative and the Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to any matter
specified in the Objection Notice, and all such discussions related thereto
shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable similar state rule,
unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Representative and the Purchaser. In
the event that the Purchaser and the Representative resolve in writing all
such disagreements, the amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses so agreed in writing by
the Purchaser and the Representative shall be final and binding upon, and non-
appealable by, the parties hereto. In the event that the Purchaser and the
Representative are unable to resolve all such disagreements within such
fifteen (15) day period after the Purchaser's receipt of such Objection
Notice, the Purchaser and the Representative shall submit such remaining
disagreements to Ernst and Young LLP, or, in the event Ernst and Young LLP
declines to accept engagement in connection herewith, such other nationally
recognized certified public accounting firm as is acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Representative (the "Accounting Firm").

(d) The Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Accounting Firm to
make a determination with respect to all remaining disagreements regarding the
computation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and Transaction Expenses identified in the Objection Notice as soon as
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days after its retention. The
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the Purchaser
and the Representative's respective calculations of Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses (as set
forth on the Closing Statement or Objection Notice, as applicable) that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Purchaser's and the
Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party (as set forth on the Closing Statement
or Objection Notice, as applicable). The Accounting Firm's



determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Transaction Expenses shall be based solely on written materials
submitted by the Purchaser and the Representative (i.e., not on the basis of
an independent review) and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement, including the
definitions of "Net Working Capital" (including Exhibit 1.02(a)),
"Indebtedness," "Cash" and "Transaction Expenses." The determination of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
Transaction Expenses by the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.

(e) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses
shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (from
the Representative Expense Holdback Amount), on the other hand, based upon the
percentage that the portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party. For
example, if the Purchaser claims Closing Net Working Capital is $1,000 less
than the amount determined by the Representative, and the Representative
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Purchaser $300
of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will
be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Representative and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷
500) to the Purchaser. In connection with its determination of Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses,
the Accounting Firm shall, pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.05(e), also
determine the allocation of its fees and expenses between the Purchaser and
the Representative, which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto.

(f) Within five (5) Business Days after Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Transaction Expenses are finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.05:

(i) if the result of Closing Net Working Capital, plus Closing Cash, minus
Closing Indebtedness, minus Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.05(c) or Section 1.05(d), is less than the
result of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, plus Estimated Cash, minus
Estimated Indebtedness, minus Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the
Sellers, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to
such deficit (the "Purchaser Adjustment Amount") (and for the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser Adjustment Amount will not be paid out of or reduce the
Escrow Account);

(ii) if the result of Closing Net Working Capital, plus Closing Cash, minus
Closing Indebtedness, minus Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.05(c) or Section 1.05(d), is greater than the
result of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, plus Estimated Cash, minus
Estimated Indebtedness, minus Estimated Transaction Expenses, then the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay to the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the Sellers, an amount equal to such excess (the "Seller
Adjustment Amount"), to be further delivered by the Paying Agent to each
Seller in accordance with its respective Allocation Percentage; and



(iii) any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 1.05(f) (the "Purchase
Price Adjustments") shall (y) be treated by all parties for tax purposes as
adjustments to the Transaction Price and (z) be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to, as applicable, the account(s) designated in
writing by the Purchaser prior to such payment or the account(s) designated in

reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of the
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.05 Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
Purchaser's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Purchaser at law or
in equity, or before or by any



Governmental Body, that will adversely affect the Purchaser's performance
under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

6.06 Broker Fees. Except for Stifel, Nicolaus and Company, Incorporated, all of
whose fees and expenses will be borne solely by the Purchaser, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Purchaser that might be
entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement

6.07 Investment Representation; Investigation. The Purchaser is acquiring the
Company Interests for its own account with the present intention of holding
such securities for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution of such securities in violation of any
federal or state securities Laws. The Purchaser is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Regulation D promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. The Purchaser is knowledgeable about the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate and is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and is
able to bear the substantial economic risk of such investment for an
indefinite period of time. The Purchaser has been afforded full access to the
books and records, facilities and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting a due diligence investigation and has
conducted a full due diligence investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

6.08 Financial Capability. The Purchaser has, and shall have at the Closing,
sufficient immediately available funds to pay the full Transaction Price and
to make all other payments required to be made by the Purchaser under this
Agreement, to pay all related fees and expenses in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and to otherwise consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

6.09 Solvency. Assuming satisfaction of the closing conditions of the
Purchaser set forth in Section 9.01, immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be able to pay their respective debts as
they become due and will own property that has a fair saleable value greater
than the amounts required to pay their respective debts (including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities). Assuming
satisfaction of the closing conditions of the Purchaser set forth in Section
9.01, immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will
have adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred, in each case by
Purchaser or its Affiliates, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in
this Section 6.09 are qualified in all respects by the assumptions that,
immediately prior to giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and will own
property that has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to
pay their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of
all contingent liabilities) and (ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, will have adequate



capital to carry on their respective businesses.

6.10 No Additional Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this ARTICLE VI, each of the
Sellers and the Company acknowledges that neither the Purchaser nor any other
Person on behalf of the Purchaser makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Purchaser or with respect to
any other information provided to the Company or any Seller by the Purchaser.

each Blocker Seller shall provide the Purchaser and the Purchaser's
Representatives with reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice and

any Blocker Seller, as applicable, reasonably determines to be appropriate to

of or regarding the Affiliates of the Company or any of the Blocker Corps
(excluding the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company) or otherwise
disclose information regarding the Affiliates of the Company or any of the
Blocker Corps (excluding Subsidiaries of the Company) that the Company or any

would waive any legal privilege or (z) would be in violation of applicable
laws or regulations of any Governmental Body (including the HSR Act and
Foreign Competition Laws) or the provisions of any written agreement to which
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of the Blocker Sellers or any of the

assets, financial performance or condition or operations.

(r) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its representatives to, abide by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such access and any
information furnished to it or its representatives pursuant to this Section
7.03. Neither the Company nor any of the Sellers nor any of the Blocker Corps
makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information, if
any, provided pursuant to this Section 7.03, and the Purchaser may not rely on

set forth in ARTICLE II regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) of AQ
Seller expressly and specifically set forth in ARTICLE III regarding AQ
Seller, (iii) of each Blocker Seller expressly and specifically set forth in
ARTICLE IV regarding such Blocker Seller and (iv) of each Blocker Corp

any manner. The information provided pursuant to this Section 7.03 will be
used solely for the purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and will be governed by all the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

7.04 Regulatory Filings. Subject to Section 12.05, the Company shall (a) make
or cause to be made all filings and submissions under any Laws or regulations
applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries for the consummation of the

filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable in
connection therewith and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary to obtain all required clearances.

7.05 Notification. The Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser of any
material variances from the representations and warranties contained in
ARTICLE II reasonably promptly upon discovery thereof; and, except for
purposes of Section 9.01(a) and Section 9.01(h), such disclosures shall amend
and supplement the Disclosure Schedules in the form of "Updated Schedules"
delivered to the Purchaser; provided that if the Closing occurs, the Updated
Schedules shall be considered and deemed part of the Disclosure Schedules for
all purposes (including indemnification) under this Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.07. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Disclosure Schedules
shall not be so amended and supplemented, and no Updated Schedules shall be
deemed to be valid, binding, effective or otherwise part of the Disclosure
Schedules, unless such Updated Schedules are either (i) received by the
Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
received by the Purchaser on a later date subject to the Purchaser's express
written agreement (email not being sufficient) that such Updated Schedules
will amend and supplement the Disclosure Schedules.

7.06 Exclusivity.



(c) From immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
through the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
ARTICLE X), neither the Company nor any of the Sellers shall take, and the
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not to take, any action to encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person (other than the Purchaser and the Purchaser's
representatives) concerning any merger or recapitalization involving the
Company, sale of the Company Interests, any sale of all or substantially all
of the assets or equity interests of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
Blocker Corps or similar transaction involving the Company, its Subsidiaries
or the Blocker Corps (other than inventory and equipment sold in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice) and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, nether the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Blocker Corps, nor the Sellers shall, or shall cause any other Person to,
enter into any other agreement (whether written or otherwise, and including
any letter of intent or similar indication of interest in such a transaction)
with any third party regarding the acquisition or recapitalization of the
Company (other than the Distribution), any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Blocker Corps, whether structured as an acquisition of assets or equity
interests, a merger or otherwise.

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, agents and representatives to, terminate any and all
negotiations or discussions with any third party regarding any proposal
concerning any merger or recapitalization involving the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Blocker Corps, the Company Interests, any sale of all or
substantially all the assets of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Blocker
Corps or other similar transaction. With respect to any Person with whom
discussions or negotiations regarding such transactions have been terminated
on or prior to the date hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to request such parties (it being acknowledged that a written notice
to such parties is sufficient) to promptly return or destroy in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement between such Person
and the Company or its Affiliates any material non-public information
previously furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company that the
Company considers highly confidential or competitively sensitive.

(e) In the event that the Company or any of the Sellers, directly or
indirectly, receives an offer from any other Person with respect to the
transactions described in this Section 7.06(c), which offer is so received on
or after the date hereof, the Company shall provide the Purchaser with written
notice thereof. Such notice shall include the material terms of such offer,
including the total consideration with respect thereto.

7.07 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this Section 7.07), the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and representatives to, use their reasonable
best efforts to cause its conditions to Closing to be satisfied and for the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and no party shall take any action
designed to prevent, impede or delay the Closing. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "reasonable best efforts" of the Company shall not require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or representatives to expend
more than a de minimis amount of money to remedy any breach of any
representation or warranty hereunder, to commence any litigation or
arbitration proceeding, to waive or surrender any right, to modify any
agreement (including any agreement set forth on Schedule 2.11), to offer or
grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any



third party, to waive or forego any right, remedy or condition hereunder or to
provide financing to the Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

7.08 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement.

(a) Ancillary to the consideration reflected within this Agreement, AQ Seller,
on behalf of itself and AQ Holdings and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Seller Non-Compete Parties"), agrees that for a period of five (5) years
following the Closing Date each Seller Non-Compete Party shall not, directly
or indirectly, (A) engage in or participate (including, without limitation, as
an investor, officer, employee, director, agent, or consultant) in or on
behalf of any entity engaging in any line of business competitive with the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted on the Closing Date
(the "SRO Business") or (B) in any capacity, directly or indirectly call on,
service or solicit SRO Business from customers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (the "Seller Non-Compete Obligations"), provided, however, that
nothing herein shall prevent a Seller Non-Compete Party from investing as a
less than 2.5% shareholder in securities of any company listed on a national
securities exchange or quoted on an automated quotation system. The geographic
limitation for the Seller Non-Compete Obligations is any state or province (or
substantially equivalent designation of a geographic area within a foreign
country) in which the Company or its Subsidiaries conduct the SRO Business
during the twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Each of the Sellers agrees, on behalf of itself and its Seller Restricted
Parties, that for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, such
Seller and its respective Seller Restrictive Parties will not, directly or
indirectly, (i) induce or solicit any person who was an executive or senior
management employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the six
(6) months preceding the date of such solicitation to terminate such
individual's employment or service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) hire or retain the services of any such person, regardless
of whether such person had been solicited for employment or (iii) assist any
other person or entity in such activities; provided that no action taken by
any "portfolio company" that is an Affiliate of any Seller or its respective
Seller Restrictive Parties, which action is taken independently by such
portfolio company and not at the direction or initiation of, or in
consultation with, such Seller or its respective Seller Restrictive Parties,
shall constitute a violation of the foregoing restrictions; provided further
that general solicitations for employment (including the use of advertisements
and employment or recruiting agencies not directed to target the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), and the hiring of individuals who respond to such
general solicitations, shall not constitute a violation of the foregoing
restrictions.

(c) Each of the Sellers, on behalf of itself and its Seller Restricted
Parties, agrees for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date not
to, directly (or through any other person or entity) make any public or
private statements (whether orally or in writing) that disparage, denigrate or
malign the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, their
respective businesses, activities, operations, affairs, reputations or
prospects or any of their respective officers, employees, directors, partners,
members, agents or shareholders. Nothing in this Section 7.08(c) shall limit
any Seller's or any of its Seller Restricted Parties' ability to make true and
accurate statements or communications in connection with any disclosure such
Person reasonably believe is required pursuant to applicable Law, in response
to incorrect, disparaging or derogatory public



statements to the extent reasonably necessary to correct or refute such public
statements or in



connection with any dispute, litigation or other proceeding related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) If, in any judicial proceeding, the court shall refuse to enforce any of
the separate covenants contained in this Section 7.08 because the time limit
is too long, it is expressly understood and agreed between the Seller
Restricted Parties and Purchaser that for purposes of such proceeding such
time limitation shall be deemed reduced to the extent necessary to permit
enforcement of such covenants. If, in any judicial proceeding, the court shall
refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants contained in this Section 7.08
because they are more extensive (whether as to geographic area, scope of
business or otherwise) than necessary to protect the business and goodwill of
Purchaser and/or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), it is expressly understood and agreed between the Seller
Restricted Parties and Purchaser that for purposes of such proceeding the
geographic area, scope of business or other aspect shall be deemed reduced to
the extent necessary to permit enforcement of such covenants.

Subsidiaries) or otherwise disclose information regarding the Purchaser or its
Affiliates (excluding the Company or its Subsidiaries) that the Purchaser
reasonably deems to be commercially sensitive, (y) would waive any legal
privilege or (z) would be in violation of applicable laws or regulations of
any Governmental Body (including the HSR Act and Foreign Competition Laws) or

Representative, neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall, and shall not
permit the Company's Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven years following
the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and

any of its Subsidiaries may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.
Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to

information and providing such assistance as the Company may reasonably
request in connection with all of the foregoing, and (c) (i) supply promptly
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested in
connection with such filings, (ii) make any further filings pursuant thereto

Purchaser shall not include undertaking any of the matters described in
Section 12.05(d).

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(h) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE VI
of this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be
expected to cause the condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) not to be
satisfied;

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
8.03 shall not limit any of the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement or the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving that
notice.

8.04 Saudi JV Access and Information. From and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide
AQ Seller and its agents with reasonable access to and reasonably necessary
assistance from the employees, officers, advisors, accountants, offices,

relating to the Saudi JV, including the winding down or disposing of AQ
Seller's interest in the Saudi JV and other purposes related thereto; provided
that such access and assistance shall be subject to the limitations described
in Section 8.01.

8.05 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(f) The Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by any of the Blocker Corps or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date,
an officer, director, employee, manager, managing member, member, fiduciary or
agent thereof (each, an "Indemnified Person"), as provided in the certificate
of formation, limited liability company agreement or equivalent organizational
documents of the Blocker Corps, the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in
Schedule 8.05(a), shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

(g) The Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any Blocker Corp, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify, any provision
in such Person's certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability
company agreement or operating agreement (or equivalent organizational
documents) relating to the exculpation or indemnification of, or advancement
of expenses to, any Indemnified Person as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing, and shall cause all such provisions to be observed by the Blocker
Corps, the Company and its Subsidiaries, it being the intent of the parties
that any Indemnified Person shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, provided that the foregoing shall not restrict any
amendment to the organizational documents of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with any merger of such Person with and into any
other Affiliate of the Purchaser (or in connection with any other internal
reorganization of the Purchaser and its Affiliates) to the extent that (i) the
organizational documents of the Person surviving such merger (or other
internal reorganization) contain provisions with respect to the
indemnification and exculpation of, and the advancement of expenses to, the
relevant Indemnified Persons to the



fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii) the Person surviving
such merger (or other internal reorganization) is no less creditworthy than
the Person not surviving such merger (or other internal reorganization).

(h) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company (at the
Purchaser's expense) to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail"
insurance policies extending coverage to all Indemnified Persons with a policy
period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' liability insurance in an amount
and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall not, or shall cause the Company to not, cancel or adversely
change such insurance policies in any respect.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 8.05 shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely. In
the event that the Purchaser, any of the Blocker Corps, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each
case, the successors and assigns of such Persons, as the case may be, shall
expressly assume and be bound by the obligations set forth in this Section
8.05.

(j) This Section 8.05 is intended to be for the benefit of each of the
Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such Indemnified Person as if
such Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The obligations of the
Purchaser under this Section 8.05 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Person.

(k) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 8.05 and the
indemnification contemplated by this Section 8.05 shall not be subject to any
of the survival or other limitation or exclusive remedy provisions of ARTICLE
XI.

8.06 Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs. For a period of ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall, and
neither shall permit any of the Company's Subsidiaries to, terminate employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in full compliance with all
applicable requirements of the WARN Act. The Purchaser shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to comply with any and all applicable notice or filing
requirements under the WARN Act, and will indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers from any liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs or expenses,
arising as a result of or related to, in whole or in part, the Purchaser's,
the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' actions or omissions occurring on or
after the Closing Date that constitute a breach of any applicable notice or
filing requirements under the WARN Act. (For the avoidance of doubt, the
indemnification contemplated by this Section 8.05 shall not be subject to any
of the survival or other limitation or exclusive remedy provisions of ARTICLE
XI.) The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for complying with the
requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code for any individual who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined
in QandA-4 of Treas. Reg. §54.4980B-9 in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



8.07 Contact with Business Relations. Without limiting the provisions of
Section 7.03, the Purchaser hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and
shall not, and shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives
or Affiliates to, contact any officer, manager, director, employee, customer,
supplier, lessee, lessor, lender, noteholder or other material business
relation of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing without the
prior consent of the Company for each such contact; provided that the
foregoing shall not restrict the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from
contacting any such Person in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice without disclosing the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.08 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this Section 8.08), the Purchaser and
AZZ shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to, use their
reasonable best efforts to cause its conditions to Closing to be satisfied and
for the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, and no such Person shall
take any action intended to, or that would reasonably be expected to, prevent,
impede or delay the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
or the provisions of Section 8.02 or Section 12.05, the Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates or representatives to,
intentionally take any action that is reasonably likely to prevent or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, the "reasonable best efforts" of the Purchaser,
and the agreement of the Purchaser contained in Section 8.08, shall not
require the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or representatives to commence
any litigation or arbitration proceeding, to waive or surrender any right, to
modify any agreement, to offer or grant any accommodation or concession
(financial or otherwise) to any third party, or to waive or forego any right,
remedy or condition hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.08
is subject in all respects to Section 12.05(d), and the "reasonable best
efforts" of the Purchaser shall not include undertaking any of the matters
described in Section 12.05(d).

8.09 Non-Disparagement. The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including AZZ and its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "Purchaser Restricted
Parties"), agrees for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date
not to, directly (or through any other person or entity) make any public or
private statements (whether orally or in writing) that disparage, denigrate or
malign the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, their respective
businesses, activities, operations, affairs, reputations or prospects or any
of their respective officers, employees, directors, partners, members, agents
or shareholders. Nothing in this Section 8.09 shall limit any of the
Purchaser's or any of its Purchaser Restricted Parties' ability to make true
and accurate statements or communications in connection with any disclosure
such Person reasonably believes is required pursuant to applicable Law, in
response to incorrect, disparaging or derogatory public statements to the
extent reasonably necessary to correct or refute such public statements or in
connection with any dispute, litigation or other proceeding related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE X 

TERMINATION



10.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing as follows and in no other manner:

(o) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Representative, on the other hand;

(p) by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or by the Representative, on the other
hand, upon the issuance by any Governmental Body of an order, decree or ruling
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or declaring unlawful the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which order, decree or ruling
shall have become final and non appealable;

(q) by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or by the Representative, on the other
hand, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the date that is
seventy-five (75) days following the date hereof (subject to Section 14.13,
the "Termination Date"); provided that no termination may be made under this
Section 10.01(c) if the failure to consummate the Closing by the Termination
Date shall be caused by the breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(c);

(r) by the Purchaser, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part
of the Company or any Seller set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company, any of the Sellers or any of the
Blocker Corps is discovered to be or shall have become untrue, in each case,
such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(a) or Section 9.01(b) would
not be satisfied; provided, however, that, (i) if such breach is curable by
the Company, such Seller or such Blocker Corp, then the Purchaser may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(d) unless such breach has
not been cured by the date which is thirty (30) days after the date on which
the Purchaser notifies the Company and the Representative of such breach (in
which case the Termination Date shall be extended until such thirtieth (30th)
day) and (ii) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.01(d) shall not be available to the Purchaser at any time that the
Purchaser has violated, or is in breach of, any covenant, representation or
warranty hereunder; and

(s) by the Representative, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of the Purchaser is discovered to be or shall have become untrue, in
each case such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section
9.02(b) would not be satisfied, including a breach of the Purchaser's
obligation to consummate the Closing.

10.02 Effect of Termination.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement
shall become void and have no further legal effect without any liability or
obligation on the part of any party hereto, (i) other than liabilities and
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) except that no such
termination shall relieve any party thereto of any liability for damages
resulting from any material breach by such party of this Agreement prior to
the date of such



termination and (iii) except that the provisions of this Section 10.02,
Section 10.03 and ARTICLE XIV shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the rights of the Company,
any Seller or any Blocker Corp under this Section 10.02, for all purposes of
this ARTICLE X, the failure of the Purchaser to consummate the Closing when
required or to make the payments required by Section 1.04 when required shall
be a willful and intentional material breach of this Agreement by the
Purchaser that is not capable of being cured, that has prevented consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that gives rise to the
Representative's termination right pursuant to Section 10.01(e). For purposes
of this Section 10.02(b) and without limiting the Company's rights under this
Section 10.02, the Purchaser shall conclusively be deemed obligated to
consummate the Closing and to make the payments required by Section 1.04 as of
a particular date, if (i) the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(a) and
Section 9.01(b) would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur on such
particular date and (ii) all conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement
(other than (y) the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(a) and Section
9.01(b), and (z) those conditions to Closing which by their terms or their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date) have been
satisfied or duly waived by the party having the benefit of such condition to
close, in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to such particular date .

(f) Notwithstanding this Section 10.02 or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing
or to any of its other obligations under this Agreement that the Purchaser or
the Company obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

10.03 Certain Other Effects of Termination. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement by either the Representative or the Purchaser as provided in
Section 10.01:

(l) each party, if so requested by any other party, will return promptly every
document furnished to it by such other party (or any Affiliate or
representative of such other party) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether so obtained before or after the
execution of this Agreement, and any copies thereof (except for copies of
documents publicly available) that may have been made, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives and any
representatives of financial institutions, financing sources and others to
whom such documents were furnished promptly to return such documents and any
copies thereof any of them may have made in each case except to the extent
retention of such documents is required by applicable Law, rule or regulation;
and

(m) the Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
survive the termination of this Agreement.

Losses for which each Seller shall be liable under Section 11.02(d), Section
11.02(e) and Section 11.02(f), as applicable, (inclusive of all amounts paid
out of the Escrow Account on behalf of such Seller in connection with any
claims under Section 11.02 and Section 13.05(a) (which amounts, to the extent

sum of (i) Transaction Price plus (ii) the aggregate amount of out of pocket
fees and expenses actually incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in

ownership or operation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Blocker Corps
by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

11.05 Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims.

(g) In order for a party (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by
any Person against the Indemnified Party, other than any Tax Proceeding (a
"Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify (i) the Purchaser, in
the case of indemnification pursuant to Section 11.04, or (ii) each Seller
from which indemnification is being sought, in the case of indemnification
pursuant



to Section 11.02 and Section 13.05(a) (in each case, as applicable, the
"Indemnifying Party") (with a copy, in the case of clause (ii), to the
Representative), in each case, in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the
Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt, but in no
event later than ten (10) Business Days after such Indemnified Party's
knowledge of such Third Party Claim; provided that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party (with a copy, where
the Indemnifying Party is a Seller, to the Representative), within five (5)
Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim; provided that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(h) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof at its expense with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party if it gives notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty
(20) Business Days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party of its intention to do so; provided that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of
any Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation; or (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from any counsel employed by the Indemnified Party, it being
understood that the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense, and the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification
for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof; provided that, subject to the limitations
in this ARTICLE XI, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof
or if the Indemnified Party has been advised by its outside counsel that there
may exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.
All the parties hereto that are party to, or an Indemnifying Party with
respect to, any Third Party Claim shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include: (x)
retaining and providing to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, (y) assisting with
the collection and preparation of discovery materials, and (z) making
employees and other representatives and advisors available on a mutually
convenient basis to prepare for or appear as witnesses at depositions, court
proceeds or trials and to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder.



(i) Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party (in either case,
the "Settling Party") shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, respectively (the "Non-Settling
Party") (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default
or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim
unless (i) the claimant and the Settling Party provide to the Non-Settling
Party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim, (ii) such settlement or compromise does not contain any admission of
liability or wrongdoing by such Non-Settling Party and (iii) such settlement
or compromise does not impose any sanctions, restrictions or obligations
(including the payment of money damages, unless the Settling Party will be
solely responsible for all of such money damages) on the Non-Settling Party.

(j) The Representative shall act on behalf of all Sellers as Indemnifying
Parties in the case of all Third Party Claims with respect to which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section
11.02(a), Section 11.02(d) or Section 13.05(a) (other than Tax Proceedings,
which are the subject of Section 13.03(b)).

11.06 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. The Indemnified
Party shall deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly upon its
discovery of any matter for which the Indemnifying Party may be liable to the
Indemnified Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a "Non-
Third Party Claim"), which written notice shall also (a) state in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances related to such Loss and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or claim to which such Loss is related,
(b) that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses or
reasonably expects that it will incur liability for Losses for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement
(and, to the extent known or reasonably calculable, the Indemnified Party's
good faith estimate of the amount of its Losses) and (c) the date such item
was paid or accrued. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and
assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for
indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters.
Such assistance and cooperation shall include retaining and providing the
Representative and its representatives, upon reasonable advance notice and
during regular business hours, with reasonable access to (y) all books,
records and other documents (including work papers, memoranda, financial
statements, Tax Returns, Tax schedules and work papers, Tax rulings, and other
determinations, etc.) relating to or containing information relevant to such
claim in their possession and (z) the Purchaser's and the Company's employees,
accountants and other professional advisors (including making the Company's
chief financial officer, accountants and attorneys available to respond to
reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Representative and its
representatives). The Representative shall act on behalf of all Sellers as
Indemnifying Parties in the case of all Non-Third Party Claims with respect to
which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.02(a) or Section 13.05(a).

11.07 Calculation of Losses Net of Insurance .

(c) The amount of any and all indemnification payments in respect of Losses
under this ARTICLE XI and Section 13.05(a) shall be determined net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies,
indemnities or other reimbursement



arrangements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax distributions
received by any Blocker Corp directly or indirectly from AQ Holdings)
(collectively, "Alternative Arrangements") with respect to such Losses (which
amounts the Purchaser agrees to, and shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives to, use diligent efforts to obtain). If an indemnification
payment is received by a Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss,
and any Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries later receives proceeds or recoveries from any Alternative
Arrangement in respect of such Loss, then the Purchaser shall immediately pay
to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Sellers, a sum equal to the lesser
of (y) the actual amount of such proceeds or recoveries and (z) the actual
amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by the Sellers
(inclusive, for the avoidance of doubt, of both amounts paid out of the Escrow
Account and amounts paid outside of the Escrow Account) with respect to such
Losses.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any
Losses of a Purchaser Indemnified Party arising out of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty contained herein shall be determined
without regard to any qualifications as to materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or words of similar import contained therein, provided that such
qualifications shall remain in effect for purposes of determining the
existence of any inaccuracy, omission, misrepresentation or breach of any such
representation or warranty.

11.08 Other Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
ARTICLE XI or elsewhere in this Agreement, this ARTICLE XI and Section
13.05(a) shall be subject to the following limitations.

(a) In no event shall any Purchaser Indemnified Party be entitled to recover
or make a claim against the Escrow Amount or any Seller, regardless of the
legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity,
or otherwise, for any amounts in respect of consequential, incidental or
indirect damages, lost profits, diminution in value or punitive, special or
exemplary damages and, in particular, no "diminution of value," "multiple of
profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be
used in calculating the amount of any Losses, except for punitive damages
solely to the extent actually paid to an unrelated third party as a result of
a final judgment. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Transaction Price for Tax purposes.

(b) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to assert any claim
with respect to any Loss consisting of or relating to Taxes with respect to
any Post-Closing Tax Period pursuant to (i) this ARTICLE XI (A) relating to a
Tax position taken with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period in reliance on a
Tax position taken with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (B) due to the
unavailability in any Post-Closing Tax Period of any net operating losses,
credits, deductions or other Tax attributes from a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
(ii) Section 13.05(a).

(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover or make
a claim for any Losses with respect to any environmental, health or safety
matter (including any breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or any environmental investigatory or corrective action) that
is discovered as a result of any Purchaser Indemnified Party conducting or
arranging for sampling or analysis of any environmental media, including soil,



sediment, air, surface water or groundwater, on or after the Closing Date,
except to the extent such Losses represent (i) amounts actually incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the performance of remedial action
ordered by any Governmental Body; (ii) the payment of any fine, penalty or
damage award ordered by any Governmental Body; (iii) in reasonable settlement
(made in accordance with Section 11.05) of a claim of noncompliance prior to
the Closing with any Environmental Laws asserted by any Governmental Body or
other third party and related out of pocket fees and expenses; (iv) amounts
actually incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the performance of
remedial action ordered by any Governmental Body that resulted from a breach
of any environmental, health or safety representation and warranty provided in
Section 2.16; or (v) the payment of any fine, penalty or damage award by
Purchaser Indemnified Parties ordered by any Governmental Body that resulted
from a breach of any environmental, health or safety representation and
warranty provided in Section 2.16.

(d) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have the right to recover under
Section 11.02 or Section 13.05(a) with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss (i)
to the extent such Loss or alleged Loss shall have been taken into account in
the determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses (it being understood, without limiting
the foregoing, that the Sellers shall not be liable pursuant to this ARTICLE
XI or Section 13.05(a) to the extent an item was substantially resolved by the
Accounting Firm in connection with the determination of Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Transaction Expenses) or (ii)
to the extent that the Company had made a corresponding reserve on the Latest
Balance Sheet.

(e) No Indemnified Party shall have any right to assert any claims, and no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification, with respect to any
Losses that would have been covered by an Alternative Arrangement had such
Person or its Affiliates maintained for their benefit the same rights or
coverage under an Alternative Arrangement following the Closing that was in
effect immediately prior to the Closing.

(f) Any Loss for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under Section 11.02 or Section 13.05(a) shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or being subject to indemnification pursuant to more
than one prong of Section 11.02.

(g) No breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein shall give rise to any right on the part of the Purchaser, after the
Closing, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, except with respect to the Escrow Amount, all
obligations of the Sellers pursuant to Section 11.02 or Section 13.05(a) are
on an individual, and not joint and several, basis.

(i) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this Agreement to the
contrary (including Section 11.03(a)), the Sellers shall have no liability
under this ARTICLE XI, Section 13.05(a) or otherwise for any Losses arising
out of or relating to any sales, use or similar



Taxes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest, penalty or
addition thereto) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless and until
such Losses are in the aggregate in excess of $2,000,000 (in which event the
Sellers shall have liability under and in accordance with this ARTICLE XI or
Section 13.05(a), if applicable, with respect to such Losses only to the
extent such Losses exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate).

11.09 Subrogation. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying
Party to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this ARTICLE XI or Section 13.05(a)
in connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than the parties or
their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or
circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party may have any right,
defense or claim relating to such claim or demand against any claimant or
plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Such Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost
of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or
claim and effecting any such subrogation.

11.10 Termination of Indemnification. The rights of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under Section 11.02 in respect of a breach of representation or
warranty or covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to Section 11.01, and the rights of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Section 13.05(a) shall terminate on
the date that is fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date; provided,
however, that such rights to recover shall not terminate, and shall continue,
with respect to any item as to which such Indemnified Party shall have, within
five (5) Business Days following the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering a written notice to the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with Section 11.05 or Section 11.06, as applicable.

11.11 Exclusive Remedy.

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that from and after the
Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
relating, directly or indirectly, to the subject matter of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal theory under
which such liability or obligation may be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, shall be
exclusively pursuant to, in accordance with and against only the parties
expressly referred to in the provisions set forth in Section 1.05, Section
8.05, Section 8.06, this ARTICLE XI, ARTICLE XIII, Section 13.05, Section
14.13 and Section 14.16, as applicable. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
of the parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action such party or any of its Affiliates may have against any other party
relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement
arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law
or ordinance or otherwise, including any rights, claims or causes of action
with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters (including all
matters arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or any other Environmental Laws).

(b) The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on remedies with respect to this
Agreement and the



transactions contemplated hereby (including Section 11.02 and this Section
11.11), constitute an integral part of the consideration given to the Sellers,
were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to each of the Sellers hereunder.

11.12 Indemnification as among Sellers. To the extent that a payment is made
to a Purchaser Indemnified Party from the Escrow Account pursuant to Section
11.02(b), Section 11.02(c), Section 11.02(e) or Section 11.02(f) on behalf of
any Seller (the "Breaching Seller"), then, in any such case, such Breaching
Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after such payment is made from
the Escrow Account, pay to each Seller other than the Breaching Seller (the
"Non-Breaching Sellers"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount equal to the Allocation Percentage of such other Seller multiplied by
the amount of such payment from the Escrow Account; provided that, upon the
determination of the Representative, distributions from the Escrow Amount to
the Sellers may be adjusted to account for any amounts owing from any
Breaching Seller to the respective Non-Breaching Sellers (and in the case of
more than one Breaching Seller such amounts may be netted) pursuant to this
Section 11.12.

ARTICLE XII 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

12.01 Acknowledgements by the Purchaser.

(t) The Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Blocker Corps, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Purchaser has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification without reliance on any Seller (including the
Representative), any Blocker Corp, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company,
or any past, present or future equityholder, officer, director, member,
manager, employee, agent, representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Specified Persons") or any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or representatives in certain "data rooms," confidential
information memoranda or management presentations (including the Confidential
Information Presentation prepared by Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. dated
December 2012 (the "Information Presentation"))or otherwise in expectation of,
or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any
discussions with respect to any of the foregoing, except for the
representations and warranties (i) of the Company expressly and specifically
set forth in ARTICLE II regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) of AQ
Seller expressly and specifically set forth in ARTICLE III regarding AQ
Seller, (iii) of each Blocker Seller expressly and specifically set forth in
ARTICLE IV regarding such Seller and (iv) of each Blocker Corp expressly and
specifically set forth in ARTICLE V regarding such Blocker Corp, in each case
of (i) through (iv), as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules and in
accordance with their respective express terms and conditions, which
constitute the sole and exclusive representations, warranties and statements
of any kind to the Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and the Purchaser understands, acknowledges and agrees that
all other



representations, warranties and statements of any kind or nature expressed or
implied (including any relating to the future or historical financial
condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of any
Blocker Corp, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity
or condition of any Blocker Corp's, the Company's or its Subsidiaries' assets)
are specifically disclaimed by the Company, each of the Sellers (including the
Representative) and each of the Blocker Corps. Except for the express and
specific representations and warranties of the respective parties described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence, neither the
Company nor any of the Sellers (including the Representative) nor any of the
Blocker Corps makes or provides, and the Purchaser hereby waives, any warranty
or representation, express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, conformity to samples, or condition of the
any Blocker Corps', the Company's or its Subsidiaries' assets or any part
thereof.

(u) In connection with the investigation by the Purchaser and its Affiliates
and representatives of the Blocker Corps, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
the Purchaser and its Affiliates and representatives have received or may
receive certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts
(including in the Information Presentation). The Purchaser acknowledges that
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections,
forward-looking statements and other forecasts, that the Purchaser is familiar
with such uncertainties, that the Purchaser is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections,
forward-looking statements and other forecasts so furnished to it and its
Affiliates and representatives (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such projections, forward-looking statements and other
forecasts), and that neither the Purchaser, nor any of its Affiliates or
representatives, shall have any claim against anyone with respect thereto.
Accordingly, the Purchaser acknowledges that none of the Specified Persons,
whether in an individual, corporate, representative, agency, fiduciary or any
other capacity, makes any representation, warranty or other statement with
respect to, and neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates or
representatives is relying on, such projections, forward-looking statements
and other forecasts or the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts, or any
discussions with respect to any of the foregoing.

Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Purchaser Releasers"), hereby irrevocably waives, acquits, remises,
discharges and forever releases each of the Specified Persons from any and all
liabilities and obligations to such Purchaser Releasers of any kind or nature

determinable, and whether arising under any Law, contract, agreement,
arrangement, commitment, undertaking or understanding, whether written or oral
(other than this Agreement and any of the other agreements executed and
delivered in connection herewith, but, in each case, only to the extent set
forth herein or therein, and other than the item numbered 6. set forth on
Schedule 2.20) or otherwise at law or in equity, and each of the Purchaser
Releasers hereby agrees that it shall not seek to recover any amounts in
connection therewith or thereunder from any of the Specified Persons (except
as provided for in this Agreement or any of the other agreements executed and
delivered in connection herewith, but, in each case, only to the extent set
forth herein or therein).



(w) Effective upon the Closing, each of AQ Seller, on behalf of itself, AQ
Intermediate, AQ Holdings and their respective successors and assigns, and the
other Sellers, on behalf of itself and its respective controlled Affiliates
and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "Sellers
Releasers"), hereby irrevocably waives, acquits, remises, discharges and
forever releases each of the Purchaser Specified Persons from any and all
liabilities and obligations to such Sellers Releasers of any kind or nature
whatsoever, whether in the capacity as an equityholder of the Company or
otherwise, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, matured or unmatured or determined or
determinable, and whether arising under any Law, contract, agreement,
arrangement, commitment, undertaking or understanding, whether written or oral
(other than this Agreement and any of the other agreements executed and
delivered in connection herewith, but, in each case, only to the extent set

only to the extent set forth herein or therein, and except for the item
numbered 6. set forth on Schedule 2.20); provided, however, that this Section
12.01(d) shall not apply to any ordinary course business transactions entered

Subsidiaries) and any of the Sellers Releasers.

(x) This Agreement may be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may be brought
against, only the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this
Agreement. Except to the extent named as a party to this Agreement, and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations of such parties set forth in
this Agreement, no Specified Person or Purchaser Specified Person will have
any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim based
upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, no claim will be brought or maintained by the Purchaser or any
other Purchaser Indemnified Party or any of their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any Specified Person that is not otherwise expressly
identified as a party to this Agreement, and no recourse will be brought or
granted against any of them by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach or nonperformance of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any party hereto set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any
certificate delivered hereunder.

12.02 Name Change and Use.

(j) Within thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing, the Sellers shall,
and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, take all actions necessary,
including filing with the applicable Governmental Body an amendment to such
Person's certificate of formation or equivalent organizational documents, to
effect the change of such Person's name to a name that does not use the words
"WSI", "SMS", or any similar words. As soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, but in any event within thirty (30) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, the Sellers shall take all actions necessary,
including without limitation making appropriate filings, to



effect such name change in each state, province, nation, municipality or other
jurisdiction where any of the Sellers or their Affiliates is qualified to
conduct business or to withdraw such qualification and to cancel any assumed
business name using any such words in all jurisdictions in which an assumed
business name certificate has been filed.

(k) Matters with respect to the use of the name "Aquilex" shall be governed by
the terms of the Trademark License Agreement.

12.03 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such party's expense, any other party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.04 Employees and Employee Benefits.

(k) Salary and Wages. Effective as of the Closing and continuing for one (1)
year thereafter, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to all employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date, including those on
lay-off, medical, disability, family or other leave of absence, paid or unpaid
(the "Retained Employees") compensation (other than equity compensation) and
employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those
provided to the Retained Employees immediately prior to the Closing,
consistent with any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, for a period beginning on the Closing and continuing
for a one (1) year period thereafter, the Purchaser shall or shall cause its
Affiliates, the Company or its Subsidiaries to provide to each Retained
Employee who remains in the employment of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) during such
period: (i) a base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunity at
least equal to the base salary or wage rate and bonus opportunity in effect
for such Retained Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii)
termination and severance benefits that are no less favorable on an individual
basis than the termination and severance benefits that would have been
applicable to such Retained Employee under any employee benefit plan of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, immediately prior to the
Closing, taking into account each such Company Employee's additional period of
service and rate of base pay or wages and bonus target with Purchaser or its
Affiliates following the Closing and the requirements of any applicable
collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in this Section 12.04(a) shall
obligate the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to
any applicable collective bargaining agreements, to continue (and shall not
prevent the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from modifying
or terminating) the employment of any such Retained Employee.

(l) Employee Service Credit. The Purchaser (i) shall give, or cause the
Company to give, each Retained Employee credit under any benefit plan or
personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee after the Closing Date,
including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance
benefits for the Retained Employee's service with the Company and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, (ii) shall use reasonable best efforts
to allow such Retained Employees to participate in each plan



providing welfare benefits, including medical, life insurance, long-term
disability insurance and long-term care insurance, without regard to
preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability
or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the
corresponding Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) if any of
the Plans are terminated prior to the end of the plan year that includes the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to credit the
Retained Employee with any expenses that were covered by the Plans for
purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under
any similar replacement plans.

(m) Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. The Purchaser shall cause the Company
to continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and personal
holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not used as
of the Closing Date, including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to
be used in future years, and shall assume all liability for the payment of
such amounts.

(n) 401(k) and Welfare Benefit Plans.

(i) Effective as of the Closing Date, employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall cease to participate in the Aquilex Corporation 401(k) Plan
(the "Seller 401(k) Plan") and, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing, the Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to the
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries the right to participate in a
plan established or maintained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates that is
qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the "Purchaser 401(k)
Plan"). As soon as is reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, AQ
Seller shall cause the Seller 401(k) Plan to either (A) transfer the account
balances of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries from the Seller
401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan in accordance with the requirements
of Sections 411(d)(6) and 414(l) of the Code, and the Purchaser shall cause
the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept such transfer in accordance with such
requirements, or (B) permit a rollover of such account balances (including
cash and any promissory notes evidencing outstanding plan loans), and in
either case, the Purchaser shall accept such transfers or rollovers into the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers and their Affiliates from any Losses arising from the fact that the
Purchaser provides or causes to be provided to such employees the right to
participate in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan effective as of a date subsequent to
the Closing Date rather than on the Closing Date.

(ii) Effective as of the Closing Date, employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and any of their eligible beneficiaries) shall cease to
participate in all welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1)) of
ERISA) sponsored or maintained by Sellers or their Affiliates.

(o) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing set forth in this Section 12.03
shall (i) confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or former employee
of the Company, any Retained Employee or upon any other Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, (ii) be construed
to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or (iii) alter or limit Purchaser's or the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' ability to amend, modify or terminate any specific benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time following the Closing.



12.05 Antitrust Notification.

(a) The Company and the Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable and no
later than three (3) Business Days following the date hereof, file with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States
Department of Justice ("DOJ"), the notification form required pursuant to the
HSR Act for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which form shall
specifically request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the
HSR Act. Each of the Company and the Purchaser shall furnish to each other's
counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act and shall provide any supplemental information
requested by any Governmental Body as promptly as practicable. The Purchaser
shall be responsible for all filing fees payable in connection with such
filings. The Purchaser shall be responsible for all of the attorneys' fees
incurred by the Purchaser in connection with such filings, and the Sellers,
jointly and severally, shall be responsible for all of the attorneys' fees
incurred by the Sellers or the Company in connection with such filings;
provided that the Sellers shall not be responsible for any such attorneys'
fees to the extent such fees (or the payment thereof) are taken into account
in the final determination of Closing Net Working Capital or Transaction
Expenses pursuant to Section 1.05.

(b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Company and the
Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain any
clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep each other apprised of
the status of any material communications with, and any inquiries or requests
for additional information from, any Governmental Body and shall comply
promptly with any such inquiry or request. The Purchaser shall take, and shall
cause its Affiliates to take, any and all reasonable steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Body or any other Person so as to enable the parties to
expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and
cooperation include counsel's undertaking (i) to keep each other appropriately
informed of material communications from and to personnel of the reviewing
Governmental Bodies and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate
contacts with and response to personnel of such Governmental Bodies and the
content of any such contacts or presentations. Neither the Company nor the
Purchaser shall participate in any material meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Body with respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the relevant
Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting
or discussion (which, at the request of either the Purchaser or the Company,
shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). The Company shall have
the right to review (subject to appropriate redactions for confidentiality and
attorney-client privilege concerns) and approve the content of any
presentations, white papers or other written materials to be submitted to any
Governmental Body in advance of any such submission.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including
Section 8.08), in no event will the Purchaser be obligated to propose or agree
to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to
make any divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or to take any
other similar action that, in the reasonable judgment of the Purchaser, could
be expected to limit the right of Purchaser to own or operate all or any
portion of their respective businesses or assets. With regard to any
Governmental Body, neither any of the Sellers, the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without the Purchaser's written consent, in the
Purchaser's sole discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction,
or discuss or commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices in any
way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action, in each case, that limits
the Purchaser's freedom of action with respect to, or the Purchaser's ability
to retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

12.06 Support Obligations.

(e) The Purchaser recognizes that AQ Seller and certain of its Affiliates have
provided credit support to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the SRO Business
and may (but shall not be obligated to) provide other credit support in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
with respect to the letters of credit, guarantees and other Support
Obligations contemplated by Schedule 12.06(a), collectively, the "Support
Obligations"). The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) use
reasonable best efforts with respect to all Support Obligations that relate
primarily to the SRO Business, obtain the full and unconditional release of AQ
Seller and its Affiliates thereunder with no further obligation, Liabilities
or Losses to AQ Seller or any of its Affiliates and (ii) with respect to
Support Obligations that are not primarily related to the SRO Business but
that relate to both the SRO Business and the remaining businesses of AQ
Holdings and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries),
use reasonable best efforts to obtain the full and unconditional release of AQ
Seller and its Affiliates from the portion of such Support Obligations as
relate, in whole or in part, to the SRO Business, in each case effective
either on the Closing Date or on a date as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and
their Affiliates from any Losses arising from the fact that the Purchaser is
unable to obtain releases contemplated by this Section 12.06(a) prior to the
Closing.

(f) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the Support
Obligations to terminate and redeliver to AQ Seller or its Affiliates, as
applicable, as soon as practicable, each original copy of each original
guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument constituting or evidencing the
Support Obligations referred to in Section 12.06(a) above, as well as to
redeliver to AQ Seller and its Affiliates, any cash collateral or other
collateral in respect of such Support Obligations and, as to any Support
Obligations terminated after the Closing, promptly to redeliver such originals
or cash to AQ Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), as applicable, and, in each case, cooperate and take such other
actions as may be reasonably required to terminate or otherwise relieve AQ
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) of
such Support Obligations as relate, in whole or in part to the SRO Business,
including executing and delivering any assumption agreements required by the
counterparties to any Support Obligations (e.g., insurers).



(g) At the Purchaser's written request prior to the Closing, AQ Seller shall
cooperate with the Purchaser in any reasonable manner in connection with the
covenants of the Purchaser described in Section 12.06(a) and Section 12.06(b);
provided, that such cooperation shall not include any requirement of AQ Seller
to expend money, commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

12.07 Insurance Matters. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, as of the Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance
policies maintained by AQ Seller or any of its Affiliates, including those set
forth on Schedule 2.15 as being maintained by AQ Seller for the benefit of the
Company, shall continue in force solely only for the benefit of AQ Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and not for the
benefit of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries). The Purchaser agrees to arrange for its own
insurance policies with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
SRO Business covering all periods following the Closing Date and agrees not to
seek, through any means, to benefit from any of the insurance policies
maintained by AQ Seller or its Affiliates with respect to such period set
forth on Schedule 2.15, provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the
Purchaser with respect to any Pre-Closing Claims. Following the Closing, AQ
Seller shall provide to Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries, access
to and, upon reasonable request, information with respect to, all occurrence-
based liability insurance policies on Schedule 2.15 that have provided
coverage to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including general
liability, workers' compensation insurance policies, and any other occurrence-
based liability insurance policies, provided that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business of AQ Seller or its Affiliates. Such
insurance, to the extent provided in the applicable policies, shall be
available to cover the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent any claims
are asserted that arise out of the operations of Company and its Subsidiaries
and the SRO Business prior to Closing, subject in each case, to the terms and
limitations of such policies ("Pre-Closing Claims"). If any Pre-Closing Claim
is asserted after the Closing, the Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be
responsible to pay all deductibles, expenses, self-retention amounts, premium
adjustments, litigation expenses or other costs as required under the
applicable insurance policies and all costs of prosecution or collection
thereof. AQ Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries in any of their efforts to
avail themselves of coverage under any such applicable insurance policies with
respect to Pre-Closing Claims, but it shall be the responsibility of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to submit claims directly to the applicable
insurers. For purposes of this Section 12.07, the "reasonable best efforts" of
AQ Seller shall not require the AQ Seller or its Affiliates or representatives
to expend any money, incur any liability, commence any litigation or
arbitration proceeding, waive or surrender any right, modify any agreement, or
to offer or grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to
any third party or to otherwise suffer any detriment.

12.08 Cancellation of Intercompany Accounts and Services. At the Closing and
after giving effect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, except
as contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement or for the item numbered
6. set forth on Schedule 2.20, all intercompany and intracompany liabilities,
obligations (including intercompany debt), accounts, contracts, and services
(including cash management and treasury, accounting, tax, insurance, human
resources, environmental, banking, legal, data network and other services)
between the Company



and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, including any agreements or understandings (written or oral) with
respect thereto, shall be cancelled and will terminate without any
consideration or further action or liability on the part of the parties
thereto and without the need for any further documentation. Effective as of
the Closing, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will no longer
have rights to credit cards or payment cards of AQ Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (or the right to use them) and, except as otherwise provided in
the Transition Services Agreement, AQ Seller and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall terminate the operation of such cards at or prior to the
Closing; provided that the Company shall provide such employees with notice of
the termination of such rights at least one (1) Business Day before the
Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this
Section 12.08, except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services
Agreement or the Trademark License Agreement, (i) each party hereto or any of
such party's Affiliates shall be permitted to remove any link on any website
owned, maintained or controlled by it to any internet website(s) owned,
maintained or controlled by the other party or any of such other party's
Affiliates without any further action or liability on the part of the removing
party and (ii) upon the request of a party hereto, the other party or any of
its Affiliates shall promptly remove or cause to be removed any link(s) to any
internet web site(s) owned, maintained or controlled by the requesting party
on any internet website owned, maintained or controlled by such other party or
any of its Affiliates.

12.09 Certain Consents.

(i) The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts or
other agreements to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a party
(including the agreements set forth on Schedule 2.11) and that such consents
have not been obtained and may not be obtained. The Purchaser agrees that
neither the Company nor any of the Sellers nor any of the Blocker Corps shall
have any liability whatsoever to the Purchaser (and the Purchaser shall not be
entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default,
acceleration or termination of or loss of right under any such contract or
other agreement as a result thereof. The Purchaser further agrees that no
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company or any of the Sellers or
any of the Blocker Corps contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached
and no condition of the Purchaser shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a
result of the failure to obtain any consent or as a result of any such
default, acceleration or termination or loss of right or any action commenced
or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consent or any such default, acceleration or termination
or loss of right. At the Purchaser's written request prior to the Closing, the
Company shall cooperate with the Purchaser in any reasonable manner in
connection with the Purchaser's obtaining any such consents; provided, that
such cooperation shall not include any requirement of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Sellers or Blocker Corps to expend money, commence
any litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party. This Section 12.09(a) shall not
limit the Company's obligations with respect to the Release Letters.



(j) AQ Seller shall either (i) on or prior to Closing, transfer its rights
under the agreements listed on Schedule 12.09(b) to the Company or (ii) to the
extent any of such agreements relate to both the SRO Business and the
remaining businesses of AQ Holdings and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries), cooperate with the Purchaser in any
commercially reasonable manner in connection with the Purchaser's efforts to
arrange discussions and participate in negotiations with the counterparties to
such agreements to enter into separate agreements with the Company or its
Subsidiaries; provided that such cooperation shall not include any requirement
of AQ Seller to expend money, commence any litigation or arbitration
proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third party; provided further that any such discussions or negotiations will
be initiated by contact from the Company, and not the Purchaser, to such
counterparty. To the extent that any such agreement cannot be so transferred
without obtaining the consent of any party thereto (other than the AQ Seller
or its Affiliates) and either such consent is not obtained or the counterparty
to such agreement does not agree to enter into a substantially similar
agreement with the Company or its Subsidiaries, AQ Seller will cooperate in a
commercially reasonable manner with the Purchaser in any lawful and
economically feasible arrangement to provide that the Company shall receive
the interest of AQ Seller in all benefits under any such agreement (to the
extent such benefits relate to the SRO Business), including without limitation
performance by AQ Seller as agent if economically feasible; provided, however,
that the Purchaser shall undertake to pay or satisfy all corresponding
Liabilities under such agreement (to the extent such Liabilities relate to the
SRO Business), in each case, to the extent the Company or its Subsidiaries
would have been responsible therefor if such transfer had been consummated as
of the Closing Date. The obligations of AQ Seller under this Section 12.09(b)
shall terminate and cease to have effect on the date that is the earlier of
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date and the expiration or termination
of such agreement in accordance with its terms. Each of AQ Seller and the
Purchaser shall indemnify the other party for Losses such party or its
Affiliates suffer as a result of any breach of any such agreement by such
party.

12.10 Provision Respecting Representation of Company. Each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, managers, members, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that Kirkland and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of
AQ Seller, CCP II AIV II Holdings, L.P., CCP II AIV II Holdings - KT, L.P.
Seller and CCP II Feeder II - AQSRO, L.P. and their controlling Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the "Seller Group"), on the one hand, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland
and Ellis LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any
director, member, partner, manager, officer, employee or Affiliate of any
member of the Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, notwithstanding such representation or any
continued representation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and each
of the parties hereto (on their own behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates)
hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof
to consent to irrevocably waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. In addition, (a) all communications between any member of the
Seller Group or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees



or representatives, on the one hand, and Kirkland and Ellis LLP, on the other
hand, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any dispute arising in connection with, this
Agreement, or otherwise relating to any potential sale of the Company (the
"Protected Seller Communications"), shall be deemed to be privileged and
confidential communications, (b) all rights to such Protected Seller
Communications, and the control of the confidentiality and privilege
applicable thereto, shall be retained by the Seller Group and (c) to the
extent the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing) should discover in its possession after the
Closing any Protected Seller Communications, it shall take reasonable steps to
preserve the confidentiality thereof and promptly deliver the same to the
Representative, keeping no copies, and shall not by reason thereof assert any
loss of confidentiality or privilege protection.

ARTICLE XIII 

TAX MATTERS

13.01 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Tax Refunds; Amended Tax Return;
and Certain Post-Closing Tax Benefits.

(l) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 13.01(a), any Tax Return of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp to be filed on or
after the Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared and
timely filed, or caused to be prepared and timely filed, by the Purchaser (at
its sole cost) on a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return
and shall not be filed without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Purchaser shall cause the Company or such Blocker Corp, as applicable, to
provide the Representative with a copy of such proposed Tax Return (and such
additional information regarding such Tax Return as may reasonably be
requested by the Representative) at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing
of such Tax Return. The Purchaser and the Representative shall use good faith
efforts to resolve any dispute regarding the preparation of Tax Returns on or
after the Closing Date attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. If the
Purchaser and the Representative are unable to resolve any dispute regarding
the preparation of such Tax Returns, they shall refer such dispute to the
Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be final and conclusive on the
parties. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Tax
Return shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Representative, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the extent such
party prevails on the Tax matter resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated based on the relative dollar
value of the original amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the
merits of the dispute regarding the Tax Returns. Nothing herein shall prevent
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp from filing such Tax Return
on its due date during the pendency of a dispute; provided that such Tax
Return shall be filed on a basis consistent with the last previous similar
return except as otherwise required by applicable Law; provided, further, that
if the Tax Return so filed differs from such final Tax Return reflecting
resolution of the dispute, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp
will promptly file any reasonably necessary amended or supplemental return or
request for refund. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and any
Subsidiary, to cooperate with the Representative



(including filing amended returns) to obtain any refunds or credits that would
result in the payment to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of any Seller,
under this ARTICLE XIII.

(m) Any Tax refunds that are received by the Purchaser, the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp and any amounts credited against Tax (in
lieu of receiving a refund) to which the Purchaser or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp become entitled, in each case, in respect
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp and related to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be (i) in the case of such Tax refunds or
credits in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for the account
of the Sellers or (ii) in the case of such Tax refunds or credits in respect
of a Blocker Corp, for the account of each Blocker Seller set forth opposite
such Blocker Corp's name on the attached Schedule I, (in either case,
excluding any refund or credit attributable to any Loss in a tax year (or
portion of a Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date applied (e.g.,
as a carry back) to income in a Tax year (or portion of a Straddle Period)
ending on or before the Closing Date), and the Purchaser shall promptly pay,
or cause to be paid, any such refund or the amount of any such credit by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in
writing by the Paying Agent prior to such payment, for the benefit of, and
further distribution to (x) in the case of such Tax refunds or credits in
respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each Seller in accordance
with its respective Allocation Percentage or (y) in the case of such Tax
refunds or credits in respect of a Blocker Corp, each Blocker Seller set forth
opposite such Blocker Corp's name on the attached Schedule I in accordance
with its percentage ownership of such Blocker Corp.

(n) Except as required by applicable Laws, the Company or any Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall not, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries not to, file an amended Tax Return for any taxable period that
begins before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(o) All Tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp shall not be bound or have any
liability thereunder.

(p) During the seven (7) years following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
not, and shall not cause or permit the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Blocker Corp to, (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each such case without the prior written
consent of the Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

13.02 Transfer Taxes. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due,
all gross receipts, transfer Taxes, gains Taxes, real property transfer Taxes,
sales Taxes, use Taxes, excise Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes and any
other similar Taxes applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
shall be paid 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the Sellers, jointly and
severally. The Purchaser shall prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such
Taxes, and the Representative shall cooperate with the Purchaser in the
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns.



13.03 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

(p) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, and
their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the conduct of any Tax
Proceeding, for which one party could reasonably require the assistance of
such other party in obtaining any reasonably necessary information. Such
cooperation shall include furnishing prior years' Tax Returns or return
preparation packages illustrating previous reporting practices or containing
historical information to the extent relevant to the conduct of the Tax
Proceeding, and furnishing such other information within such party's
possession requested by the other party to the extent relevant to the conduct
of the Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and information also shall include
forwarding copies of appropriate notices and forms or other communications
received from or sent to any Governmental Body which relate to the Company,
any Subsidiary or any Blocker Corp and providing copies of all relevant Tax
Returns, together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers,
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by any Governmental Body
and records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which the
requested party may possess. Sellers agree to retain all books and records
with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries and any Blocker Corp until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser, any extensions thereof)
of the respective taxable periods.

(q) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall control (at its own expense) any
Tax Proceeding with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Blocker Corp. For any Tax Proceeding with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the applicable Blocker Corp that includes any item the
adjustment of which could entitle the Purchaser to receive any payment
pursuant to Section 11.02(a) or Section 11.02(c), the Purchaser shall (i)
consult with the Representative (for any such Tax Proceeding with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or the applicable Blocker Seller (for
any such Tax Proceeding with respect to any a Blocker Corp), (ii) provide the
Representative or such Blocker Seller, as applicable, with all information and
documents related thereto, (iii) permit the Representative or such Blocker
Seller, as applicable, and its representative to attend any such Tax
Proceeding, and (iv) not settle any such adjustment item or related issue
without the written consent of the Representative or such Blocker Seller, as
applicable.

13.04 FIRPTA Certificate. On or prior to the Closing Date, AQ Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser a certificate certifying that the purchase by the
Purchaser of the Company Interests, other than the Blocker Interests, from AQ
Seller is exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code. Each Blocker
Corp shall deliver to Purchaser an affidavit, under penalties of perjury,
stating that such Blocker Corp is not and has not been a United States real
property holding corporation, dated as of the Closing Date and in the form and
substance required under Section 1.897-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations.

13.05 Pre-Closing Tax Indemnification.

(h) Subject to the limitations set forth in ARTICLE XI, including Section
11.01, Section 11.03(b), Section 11.03(c), Section 11.03(d), Section 11.03(e),
Section 11.08 and Section 11.10:



(i) each Seller shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries from and against, without duplication,
any Losses attributable to Indemnified Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and

(ii) each Blocker Seller shall individually (and not jointly and severally)
indemnify and hold harmless the Blocker Corp set forth opposite such Blocker
Seller's name on the attached Schedule I from and against, without
duplication, any Losses attributable to Indemnified Taxes of such Blocker
Corp;

provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, the
respective Sellers shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes exceed
the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) on the face of the Closing Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto) and taken into account in determining the Purchase Price Adjustment.

(i) In the case of a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or gross or net sales, payments or receipts of the Company,
each of its Subsidiaries and each Blocker Corp for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of
any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed
to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Blocker Corp for a Straddle Period that relates to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

14.04 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by either the Purchaser, any of the Sellers or the Company without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser and the Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, AQ Seller shall be
permitted to (a) assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement and
any of the provisions hereof to (i) an Affiliate of AQ Seller and (ii) any
purchaser of all or substantially all of the equity or assets of AQ Seller (or
other purchaser of all or any portion of AQ Seller or its respective business)
or (b) make a collateral assignment to any lender (or an agent thereof) of AQ
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries for security purposes,
provided that notwithstanding any such assignment, AQ Seller will remain
responsible for all of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser



shall be permitted to make a collateral assignment to any lender (or an agent
thereof) of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries for
security purposes, provided that notwithstanding any such assignment, the
Purchaser will remain responsible for all of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement.

14.05 Amendment and Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may
be amended or waived only in a writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company
and the Representative. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or
default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or
prior or subsequent breach or default.

14.06 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including Section 8.05, nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with this Agreement without notice or liability to any
other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

14.07 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company or any of the Sellers or Blocker Corps
contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules (each, a "Provision")
addresses a particular issue with specificity (a "Specific Provision"), and no
breach by the Company or any of the Sellers or Blocker Corps, as applicable,
exists under such Specific Provision, then such Person shall not be deemed to
be in breach of any other Provision (with respect to such issue) that
addresses such issue with less specificity than the Specific Provision and if
such Specific Provision is qualified or limited by such Person's knowledge, or
in any other manner, no other Provision shall supersede or limit such
qualification in any manner.

14.08 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise
modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

14.09 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for
purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections corresponding to the
sections of this Agreement;



however, each section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedules to the extent the relevance of such information in such
other section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent. Capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have
the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar
amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, the Updated Schedules
or the attached exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher
or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not
required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required
to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and no party shall
use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, the Updated Schedules or
exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules, the Updated Schedules or exhibits is or is not required
to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be
disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice. In addition, matters
reflected in the Disclosure Schedules and the Updated Schedules are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in
the Disclosure Schedules and the Updated Schedules. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. No information set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules or the Updated Schedules shall be deemed to broaden in any way the
scope of the parties' representations and warranties. Any description of any
agreement, document, instrument, plan, arrangement or other item set forth on
any Disclosure Schedule or Updated Schedule is a summary only and is qualified
in its entirety by the terms of such agreement, document, instrument, plan,
arrangement or item. The information contained in this Agreement, in the
Disclosure Schedules, the Updated Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of
contract.

14.10 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement and any other agreements executed
and delivered in connection herewith, contains the entire agreement of the
parties respecting the sale and purchase of the Company and the Blocker Corps
and supersedes all prior agreements among the parties respecting the sale and
purchase of the Company. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises with respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions
of the execution version of this Agreement shall control and prior drafts of
this Agreement and the documents referenced herein shall not be considered or
analyzed for any purpose (including in support of parol evidence proffered by
any Person in connection with this Agreement), shall be deemed not to provide
any evidence as to the meaning of the provisions hereof or the intent of the
parties with respect hereto and shall be deemed joint work product of the
parties.

14.11 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way



inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated by this Agreement, this
Agreement shall govern and control.

14.12 No Partnership or Other Relationship Created. In no event shall this
Agreement be deemed to create a partnership between any Seller, any Blocker
Corp, the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, and in no event shall any
fiduciary or similar duty be deemed owed by any Seller, any Blocker Corp, the
Company or any of its Affiliates to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.
The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities
and obligations respecting the sale and purchase of the Company and the
Blocker Corps exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim that
they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that
this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties
derived from arm's-length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement
specifically acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with
another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length transaction. Nothing in this
Agreement (including Section 7.01 hereof) is intended to give the Purchaser or
its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Closing and, without
limiting its obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall exercise
complete control over its and its Subsidiaries' operations.

14.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly
agreed that (a) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 14.14 without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of specific performance
and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor
the Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree
not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
14.13 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the Termination
Date, any party hereto brings any action, in each case in accordance with
Section 14.14, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party, the Termination Date shall automatically
be extended (y) for the period during which such action is pending, plus ten
(10) Business Days or (z) by such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in no event shall this Section 14.13 be used, alone or
together with any other provision of



this Agreement, to require the Company to remedy any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company made herein.

14.14 Jurisdiction and Exclusive Venue. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any other party or its successors or permitted assigns
shall be brought and determined only in the Delaware Chancery Court and any
state court sitting in the State of Delaware to which an appeal from the
Delaware Chancery Court may be validly taken, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees
not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the
courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein, and no party will file a
motion to dismiss any action filed in a state or federal court in the State of
Delaware, on any jurisdictional or venue-related grounds, including the
doctrine of forum non-conveniens.

14.15 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) will be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to agreements executed and performed entirely within such State
without regards to conflicts of law principles of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware to apply.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS EXECUTED AND
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND
THEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND THEREFORE
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT
EXECUTED AND DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY AND THEREBY, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY. EACH
PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.



14.16 Representative.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 14.16, AQ Seller is
designated as the representative of the Sellers (such Person, when acting in
such capacity, the "Representative"), to serve, and the Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that the Representative shall serve, as the sole representative
of the Sellers, from and after the Closing Date, with respect to the matters
set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement and any
other document or agreement contemplated thereby or thereby, such service to
be without compensation except for the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses
and indemnification specifically provided herein. The Representative has
accepted such designation as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Sellers. The
Representative will, at all times, be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Sellers; provided, however, that the Representative shall
not be required to follow any such direction and shall be under no obligation
to take any action in its capacity as Representative based upon any such
direction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or the Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement, the Representative shall
have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities on behalf of any Seller shall otherwise exist against the
Representative. The relationship created herein is not to be construed as a
joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the Representative
or any other Seller or the Purchaser for any purpose of U.S. federal or state
law, including federal or state income Tax purposes. Neither the
Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to
any other Seller.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Representative shall be the agent,
proxy and attorney-in-fact for each Seller for all purposes of this Agreement,
including full power and authority: (i) to take all actions that the
Representative considers necessary or desirable in connection with the
defense, pursuit, negotiation or settlement of any determinations relating to
the payment or determination of the Purchaser Adjustment Amount or the Seller
Adjustment Amount and to sue, defend, negotiate, settle and compromise any
claims made by or against, and other disputes with, the Purchaser or any other
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow and Paying
Agent Agreement or any of the agreements, instruments, documents or
transactions contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (ii) to
engage and employ agents and representatives (including accountants, legal
counsel and other professionals) and to incur such other expenses as the
Representative shall deem necessary or prudent in connection with the
administration of the foregoing, (iii) to provide for all expenses incurred in
connection with the administration of the foregoing and to be reimbursed for
such expenses from the Representative Expense Holdback Amount, (iv) to
disburse, or cause to be disbursed, to the Sellers any funds received
(including by the Paying Agent) on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement,
(v) to receive, hold and manage the Representative Expense Holdback Amount to
pay amounts pursuant to Section 14.16(f), (vi) to take all other actions and
exercise all other rights which the Representative in its sole discretion
considers necessary or appropriate in connection with this Agreement or the
Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement, including execution and delivery of the
Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement, and any amendment or waiver to this
Agreement or the Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement, and the other agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby or executed



in connection herewith. All decisions and acts by the Representative shall be
binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(c) In the event that any Person authorized hereunder as part of the
Representative shall die, become incapacitated, resign or otherwise fail to
act on behalf of the Sellers for any reason, the Representative shall include
such other Person as shall be acceptable to the continuing representative, and
such substituted representative, together with the continuing representative,
together shall be deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement.

(d) The Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the Sellers
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the Sellers, and the other
parties hereto shall be entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the
Representative without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any
Seller even if such party shall be aware of any actual or potential dispute or
disagreement among the Sellers. Each of the other parties hereto is expressly
authorized to rely on the genuineness of the signature of the Representative
and, upon receipt of any writing which reasonably appears to have been signed
by the Representative, the other parties hereto may act upon the same without
any further duty of inquiry as to the genuineness of the writing.

(e) Neither the Representative nor any of its members, partners, managers,
officers, agents or other representatives or Affiliates shall incur any
liability to any Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of such Persons
for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or relating to the performance of their duties hereunder. Neither the
Representative nor any of its members, partners, managers, officers, agents or
other representatives or Affiliates shall be liable to any Seller relating to
the performance of the Representative's duties under this Agreement for any
errors in judgment, negligence, oversight, breach of duty or otherwise,
regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be
sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law
or in equity, or otherwise, except to the extent it is finally determined in a
court of competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the
actions taken or not taken by the Representative constituted gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Representative and its members, managers, officers,
agents and other representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Sellers against all Losses paid or incurred in connection with any action,
suit, proceeding or claim to which any of such Persons is made a party by
reason of the fact that it was acting as the Representative pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Representative shall not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder to the extent it is finally determined in a court of
competent jurisdiction by clear and convincing evidence that the actions taken
or not taken by the Representative constituted gross negligence or willful
misconduct. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification contemplated by
this Section 14.16(e) shall not subject to any of the survival or other
limitation or exclusive remedy provisions of ARTICLE XI.

(f) Any amount owing to the Representative from any Seller pursuant to this
Section 14.16 shall be deductible at the option of the Representative from the
next succeeding distribution(s), if any, of the Escrow Amount, as applicable,
by the Escrow Agent to, or for the benefit of, such Seller. The Representative
shall be protected in acting upon any notice, statement or certificate
believed by him to be genuine and to have been furnished by the appropriate
person and in acting or refusing to act in good faith or any matter.



(g) The Purchaser shall pay the Representative Expense Holdback Amount to the
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.04(c), for the benefit of and further
distribution to the Representative. The Representative shall receive, hold and
manage the Representative Expense Holdback Amount, which amount shall be
available to reimburse the Representative for any expenses incurred or
anticipated to be incurred by the Representative arising out of or in
connection with the exercise of the Representative's powers and authority
hereunder, including the payment of reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Representative. Following the Escrow Termination Date
and upon final resolution of all proper claims pursuant to ARTICLE XI and
Section 13.05(a) or otherwise related to the Agreement and the terms and
conditions of the Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement and full reimbursement of
all Losses of the Representative pursuant to Section 14.16(e), the
Representative shall distribute or cause to be distributed any remaining
portion that has not been released from the Escrow Account to the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of and further distribution to each Seller in
accordance with such Seller's Allocation Percentage.

(h) The appointment of the Representative shall be deemed coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable, and the Purchaser and any other Person may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Representative in all matters referred to herein.

14.17 Counterparts and PDF. This Agreement, the Escrow and Paying Agent
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement
and any other agreements referred to herein or therein, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, may be executed in multiple counterparts, any one of which
need not contain the signature of more than one party, but all such
counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any
counterpart, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine, .PDF or other electronic transmission, shall be treated in all manner
and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
contract, each other party hereto or thereto will re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
contract will raise the use of a facsimile machine, .PDF or other electronic
transmission to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or contract
was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine, .PDF or
other electronic transmission as a defense to the formation of a contract and
each such party forever waives any such defense.

14.18 Guaranty. In consideration of the execution and delivery by the Sellers,
the Company and the Blocker Corps of this Agreement, AZZ, as parent of the
Purchaser, hereby guarantees absolutely and unconditionally to Sellers, the
Company and the Blocker Corps (a) the due and punctual performance, when and
as due, of all obligations, covenants and agreements of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates arising under or pursuant to this Agreement; (b) the accuracy of
the Purchaser's representations and warranties set forth herein; and (c) the
punctual payment of all sums, if any, now or hereafter owed by the Purchaser
under this Agreement. The liability of the AZZ under this guaranty shall be
unlimited and unconditional, and this guaranty shall be a continuing guaranty.
