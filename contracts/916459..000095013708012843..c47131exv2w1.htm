times to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not

  15.9  |   | No waiver by any of the Parties of any condition or of the
breach of any term, covenant, representation, warranty or undertaking
contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or

of the breach of any other term, covenant, representation, warranty or
undertaking in this Agreement.  
      
  15.10  |   | Any liability of any Party under this Agreement may in

agreements and obligations made, given or entered into in this Agreement by

such representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant, agreement or obligation
shall extend only to any loss or damage arising from his own breach.  
      
  15.14  |   | This Agreement or any of the documents referred to in it
may be amended, modified, superseded or cancelled and any of its terms,
covenants, representations, warranties, undertakings or conditions may be

authorised by) each of the Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the
Party waiving compliance.

methods, Software, goods and services used or dealt in by it, and the
products or services manufactured or supplied by it) have resulted in a claim
in respect of Intellectual Property Rights for compensation under sections 40

approximates to sections 40 and 41 of the Patents Act 1977) nor, so far as

  26.8.2  |   | all premiums payable in respect of any insurance policy;
and  
      
  26.8.3  |   | all taxes and expenses, including any fees for services
rendered or requested in respect of the Pension Schemes and any tax charges
payable under Chapter 5 of Part IV of the Finance Act 2004.  
      
  26.9  |   | Except in relation to the arrangements in South Africa (full
details of which are Disclosed), no event has occurred (other than due to any
action by the Purchaser apart from the fulfilment of its obligations under
this Agreement) which could result in any of the Pension Schemes being

occupational pension scheme which has not yet been paid in full.  
      
  26.12  |   | No employees of any member of the Target Group have a right
to enhanced pension benefits on redundancy or early retirement, or to a set
amount of employer contributions, as a result of their employment having
transferred to a member of the Target Group under the Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 or 2006.  
      
  26.13  |   | Save as disclosed, no member of the Target Group has
indemnified the trustees of a Pension Scheme or anyone else in respect of any
liabilities relating to a Pension Scheme.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     26.14  |   | No contribution notice or financial support direction
(as defined in sections 38 to 51 of the Pensions Act 2004) has been issued in
respect of the Pension Schemes or to any member or director of the Target

     4  |   | A Manager shall have no liability in respect of any
Managers Warranty Claim:  
---|---|--- 
      
  4.1  |   | to the extent that the claim in question arises, or is
increased wholly or partly from an act or omission compelled by law after
date of this Agreement; or  
      
  4.2  |   | to the extent that the claim in question arises, or is

regulation, directive or published practice of any government, government
department, agency, tax authority or other fiscal, monetary or regulatory
body (including extra statutory concessions of HMRC) made after the date of
this Agreement whether or not having retrospective effect; or  
      
  4.3  |   | to the extent that the claim in question would not have

any of its Group Companies (including the Company or any of the Subsidiaries)
after the date of this Agreement otherwise than in the ordinary course of
business; or  
      
  4.4  |   | to the extent that the matter or circumstance giving rise to
the claim in question arises (in whole or in part) from any event before or
after the date of this Agreement at the request or direction of the Purchaser
or its authorised representatives or professional advisers; or  
      
  4.5  |   | to the extent that the claim is based upon a liability which
is contingent only, unless and until such contingent liability becomes an
actual liability provided that where the Purchaser has given notice of a
Managers Warranty Claim in respect of a contingent liability prior to the
end of the 18 month period set out in paragraph 3, the time periods in
paragraph 3 shall be suspended in respect of such Managers Warranty Claim
until (i) such time as the relevant liability becomes an actual liability and
(ii) if a contingent liability has not become an actual liability within 36
months of the Purchaser serving notice of the claim pursuant to paragraph 3
above, the Managers liability in respect of such Managers Warranty Claim
shall terminate absolutely and the Managers Warranty Claim shall be deemed
to have been withdrawn and shall become fully barred and unenforceable; or  
      
  4.6  |   | to the extent that the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is
insured against any loss or damage suffered by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries forming the basis of the claim in question under the terms of
any insurance policy of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for the time
being in force; or  
      
  4.7  |   | if the Purchaser assigns or purports to assign any of its
rights under this Agreement other than in accordance with Clause 14 of this
Agreement; or  
      
  4.8  |   | to the extent the claim in question relates to a taxation
liability of the Target Group which arises out of the ordinary course of
business of the Target Group since the date of the Accounts; or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     4.9  |   | to the extent that the liability or other matter giving
rise to the claim in question is fairly disclosed in the Disclosure Letter,
the Data Room, the Information Memorandum or the Due Diligence Reports; or  
---|---|--- 
      
  4.10  |   | to the extent the claim occurs wholly or partly out of or
the amount thereof is increased as a result of (in which case only the amount
of the increase shall be discounted):  
      
  4.10.1  |   | any change in the accounting principles or practices of
the Purchaser (including the length of any accounting period for tax
purposes) introduced or having effect after the date of this Agreement other
than where legally necessary to comply with applicable accounting
standards; or  
      
  4.10.2  |   | any increase in the rates of taxation made after the date
of this Agreement; or  
      
  4.11  |   | to the extent that the Purchaser was actually aware prior to
the date of this Agreement of the matter or circumstances giving rise to the
claim in question; or  
      
  4.12  |   | to the extent that the fact, matter, event or circumstance
giving rise to such claim is remediable and is remedied by or at the expense
of the Managers within 60 days of the date upon which notice of such claim is
given to the Managers Representatives.  
      
  5  |   | The scope of the Managers liability in relation to each of
Intellectual Property Rights, Properties, Environmental/Health and Safety
(EHS) matters and Pensions (respectively paragraphs 12, 14 to 20, 21 to 24
and 26 of Section 3A of Part 3 of the Managers Warranties) and Taxation
(Section 3B of Part 3 of the Managers Warranties) has been limited to
such paragraphs and the Manager shall have no liability in respect of any
Managers Warranty Claim relating to such matters other than under the terms
of those specific paragraphs.  
      
  6  |   | If any matter comes to the notice of the Purchaser, the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries which may give rise to a liability under the
Managers Warranties, the Purchaser shall (and shall procure that its Group
Companies, including the Company and the Subsidiaries shall):  
      
  6.1  |   | as soon as reasonably practicable give written notice of that
matter to the Managers Representatives, specifying in reasonable detail the
nature of the potential liability and, so far as is practicable, the amount
likely to be claimed in respect of it and thereafter shall regularly consult
with the Managers Representatives with respect to the matter;  
      
  6.2  |   | retain and preserve all relevant assets, documents, records
and information within the power, possession or control of the Purchaser and
its Group Companies (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) of, or
relating to the Target Group which are or are reasonably likely to
be relevant in connection with any claim for so long as any actual or
prospective claims remain outstanding;  
      
  6.3  |   | not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise
with any person, body or authority in relation to that matter without the
prior written consent of the Managers Representatives which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld;  
      
  6.4  |   | give the Managers and their professional advisers reasonable
access to the premises and personnel of the Purchaser and/or the Company or
any of the  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | Subsidiaries (as the case may be) and to any relevant
chattels, accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the
Purchaser and/or the Company or any of the Subsidiaries so as to enable the
Managers and their professional advisers to examine such premises, chattels,
accounts, documents and records and to take copies at their own expense;  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     6.5  |   | subject to the Managers indemnifying the Purchaser
and/or the Company and the Subsidiaries to the Purchasers reasonable
satisfaction against any liability, costs, damages or expenses which are
properly incurred as a result of any request by the Managers, take such action
as the Managers may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, resist, compromise
or defend any claim arising out of the matter in question.  
---|---|--- 
      
  7  |   | If the Purchaser and/or the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
is or may be entitled to recover from some other person any sum in respect of
any matter giving rise to a Managers Warranty Claim, the Purchaser shall as
soon as is reasonably practical give detailed written notice to the Managers
of the matter and thereafter shall regularly consult with the Managers with
respect to the matter and shall procure that all reasonable steps are taken to
enforce recovery and, if any sum is so recovered, then either the amount
payable by the relevant Manager(s) in respect of that Managers Warranty
Claim shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum recovered (less the
reasonable costs of such recovery and any related loss of any reduction in or
relief from taxation which had arisen by virtue of the relevant loss
or damage) or (if any amount shall already have been paid by the relevant
Manager(s) in respect of that Managers Warranty Claim) there shall be repaid
to the relevant Manager(s) an amount equal to the amount recovered (less the
reasonable costs of such recovery and any related loss of any reduction in or
relief from taxation which had arisen by virtue of the relevant loss
or damage) or (if less) the amount of such payment (less the reasonable costs
of such recovery and any related loss of any reduction in or relief from
taxation which had arisen by virtue of the relevant loss or damage) (in
either case with any interest paid by such other person but less any tax
chargeable on the Purchaser or the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in
respect of such interest).  
      
  8  |   | If at any time after Completion a Manager wishes to insure all
or any part of his liability in respect of Managers Warranty Claims, the
Purchaser shall provide such information as any prospective insurer or broker
may reasonably require before effecting such insurance, subject to such
insurer or broker (as the case may be) agreeing (save as required by
applicable law or regulation) to keep such information as it receives from
the Purchaser confidential.  
      
  9  |   | The Purchaser confirms on behalf of itself and as trustee for
each of its Group Companies that at the date of this Agreement it is not
aware of any breach of Managers Warranty.  
      
  10  |   | For the avoidance of doubt:  
      
  10.1  |   | nothing in this Schedule shall limit the Purchasers
obligation to mitigate its loss in respect of any Managers Warranty Claim;  
      
  10.2  |   | neither the Purchaser nor the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to recover damages in respect of any Managers
Warranty Claim or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       |   | otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution more than
once in respect of the same fact, subject matter, circumstances or loss.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     11  |   | If at any time after the Completion Date a Manager
wishes to insure all or any part of its liability in respect of a Managers
Warranty Claim, the Purchaser shall at that Managers expense provide such
information as any prospective insurer or broker may reasonably
require before effecting such insurance.  
---|---|--- 
      
  12  |   | Reference in a Warranty to the Company or the Managers "having
received notice" or "having been put on notice" or any similar expression
shall be construed as a reference to written notice having been received by a
Manager or the Company as appropriate.  
      
  13  |   | This Schedule 6 shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding Completion and in particular shall not be discharged in whole
or in part by any breach of any of the Managers Warranties or any Managers
Warranty Claim.  
   

   #####
