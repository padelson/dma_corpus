of Athena (" _Merger Sub_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

Everest;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Everest, Newco and
Athena are entering into the Distribution Agreement, pursuant to which and as
more fully described in the Distribution Agreement, prior to the Effective
Time, Everest will undertake the Internal Restructuring and, in connection
therewith, effect the Newco Contribution, and, in exchange therefor, Newco
shall (i) issue to Everest additional shares of Newco Common Stock and (ii)
pay to Everest the Cash Payment, following which, prior to the Effective Time
on the Closing Date, Everest and Newco will effect the Distribution;

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Everest, Newco, Athena and
Merger Sub have each approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Newco immediately following the Distribution, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL
(the " _Merger_ "); and

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) the Newco Contribution and
Distribution, taken together, are intended to qualify as a transaction

intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and (iii) each of this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement

Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

 _DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTIONS_

 

Section 1.1 _The_ _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Newco. By virtue of the Merger,
at the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
Newco shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").



   

Section 1.2 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.3 _Closing_ _;_ _Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, subject to the provisions of
_Articles VI_ and _VII,_ the closing of the Merger and the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m., Central time, at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP, 155 N. Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, on a date and time to
be designated jointly by Everest and Athena, which shall be no later than the
second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Articles VI_ and _VII_
(other than the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such
conditions), or at such other date, time or place as Athena and Everest may
mutually agree. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, a certificate of merger, with respect to the Merger, satisfying the
applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by Newco and
concurrently with the Closing shall be filed by Newco with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time
of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be designated jointly by
Everest and Athena and specified in such certificate of merger (the time as of
which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the " _Effective Time_
").

 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Newco, as is
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on
_Exhibit_ _B_ hereto, and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirement;

(b) At the Effective Time, Athena shall take such action necessary to change
the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, to be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except as to the name of
the Surviving Corporation, which shall be "ChampionX Holding Inc.", until
thereafter amended as provided by applicable Legal Requirement, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or such bylaws; and

(c) The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after
the Effective Time shall be the same individuals who are the directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 1.5 _Conversion of Newco Common Stock in the Merger_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Everest, Newco, Athena, Merger Sub or any stockholder of any of the foregoing:

(i) each share of Newco Common Stock held in Newcos treasury shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof;

 



2

    

(ii) except as provided in clause (i) above, and subject to  _Section_ __ _
1.5(c)_, each share of Newco Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.5(a)(i)_) shall be converted into the right to receive a number of duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Athena
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_; and

 

(iii) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Athena.

(b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Athena Common Stock are changed into
a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division
or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, combination of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if
a stock dividend is declared by Athena during such period, then the Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. This
_Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_ shall not permit Athena to take or refrain from taking
any action which it is obligated to take or refrain from taking pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.3_.

(c) No fractional shares of Athena Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of shares of Newco Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Athena Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Athena Common Stock issuable to
such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share, be paid in cash the
dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), after deducting any
required withholding Taxes, on a pro rata basis, without interest, determined
by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of Athena Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last Business Day prior to the
date on which the Merger becomes effective. Payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Athena Common Stock shall be made solely for the purpose
of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Athena of issuing fractional
shares of Athena Common Stock and shall not represent separately bargained-for
consideration.

Section 1.6 _Exchange of Newco Common Stock_.

 

(a) Pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Distribution Agreement, the Exchange Agent
(as defined below) shall hold, for the account of the relevant Everest
stockholders, book-entry shares representing all of the outstanding shares of
Newco Common Stock distributed in the Distribution.

 

(b) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Everest
shall appoint a nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Athena as exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
") for the benefit of the holders of Newco Common Stock. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Athena shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_ , such shares of Athena
Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_
(such shares of Athena Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_ received by the Exchange
Agent with respect to such shares of Athena Common Stock, are referred to
collectively as the "Exchange Fund"). Athena will make available to
the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as
needed or as reasonably requested by Everest, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_.
Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Athena Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to this _Article I_ from the shares of Athena Common Stock held in
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



3

    

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, and Athena
shall cause the Exchange Agent to, deliver to each Person who was a record
holder of shares of Newco Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(i) a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger and (ii) from the Exchange
Fund, the number of whole shares of Athena Common Stock that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(ii)_
(and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Athena Common Stock pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_). From and after the Effective Time, any share of
Newco Common Stock will represent only the right to receive shares of Athena
Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(ii)_ (and
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Athena Common Stock as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_).

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Athena Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
or otherwise delivered to the holder of any shares of Newco Common Stock with
respect to the shares of Athena Common Stock that cannot be distributed
by the Exchange Agent to such holder promptly after the Effective Time,
whether due to a legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject
to the effect of applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or other Legal
Requirement, following the distribution of any such previously undistributed
shares of Athena Common Stock, there shall be paid to the record holder of
such shares of Athena Common Stock, without interest, at the time of such
distribution, the amount of cash in lieu of any fractional share of Athena
Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Athena Common Stock. Athena
shall deposit all such dividends and distributions in the Exchange Fund.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
any shares of Newco Common Stock with respect to the shares of Athena Common
Stock that the Exchange Agent is not able to distribute to such holders as of
the date that is one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Athena upon demand, and any holders of shares of Newco Common Stock who have
not theretofore exchanged their shares of Newco Common Stock in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ shall thereafter look only to Athena for
satisfaction of their claims for Athena Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Athena Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
1.5(c)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.6(d)_ with respect to shares of Athena Common Stock, in each case without
interest thereon.

(f) None of Everest, Athena or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder or former holder of shares of Newco Common Stock or to any other
Person with respect to any shares of Athena Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, required to be
delivered to any public official or Governmental Body pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law, escheat or similar law or other Legal
Requirement.

 

Section 1.7 _Closing_ _of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of Newco shall be closed and no transfer shall be
made of any shares of Newco Common Stock that were outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 



4

    

Section 1.8 _Tax_ _Consequences_. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
the Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties to this Agreement have adopted this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each party hereto shall cause
all Tax Returns relating to the Merger filed by such party to be filed on the
basis of treating the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code unless otherwise required by a "determination"
(within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code).

 

Section 1.9 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Closing, any further
action is determined by Athena or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and Newco, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Athena shall be fully authorized (in the
name of Merger Sub, in the name of Newco and otherwise) to take such action.

 

Section 1.10 _Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Everest, Athena and

Commitment Letter as a condition to the obligations under the Athena
Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Athena
Financing contemplated by the Athena Commitment Letter will not be available
to Athena immediately

 



37

    

 prior to, or on, the Closing Date to the extent Athena requests the proceeds

financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Athena

Subsidiaries (including the Newco Companies) or the Newco Business) to, or
entering into discussions and negotiations with, any Person in response to a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement

consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, the Athena
Board determines in good faith is, or is reasonably expected to, result in an
Athena Superior Offer if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
material breach of any of the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _

the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry and the terms thereof, including a copy of any written Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and any other substantive documentation in
respect of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry received from the

including, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry

the proviso in  _Section_ __ _ 4.5(a)_.

(d) Each of Athena and Everest shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective

to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, non-
solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar Contract to which any Athena

use its reasonable efforts to cause each such agreement to be enforced at the
request of Everest except to the extent that the Athena Board determines in
good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Athena Board to its stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements.

Statements_ ") to register the shares of Newco Common Stock to be distributed
in the Distribution. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Athena
Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Newco Registration Statements have
been declared effective, Everest shall file with the SEC a Schedule TO
(together with any amendments thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") if Everest
elects to effect the Distribution in whole or in part by means of an Exchange
Offer. Athena and Everest shall also file such other appropriate documents
with the SEC as may be applicable. Each of Athena and Everest shall: (A) cause
the Athena Form S-4 Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the Newco Registration Statements and the Schedule TO (if applicable) to
comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC; (B)
promptly notify the other of, cooperate with each other with respect to,
provide the other party (and its Representatives) with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, and respond promptly to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Athena Form S-4 Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Newco Registration Statements
or the Schedule TO (if applicable); (C) provide the other party (and its
Representatives) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Athena Form S-4 Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
Newco Registration Statements or the Schedule TO (if applicable), prior to
filing of any such document with the SEC; (D) have each of the Athena Form
S-4 Registration Statement and the Newco Registration Statements become
effective under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, respectively, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after each is filed with the SEC (it being
understood that each of Athena and Everest shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Athena Form S-4 to become effective under the Securities
Act prior to the date on which the financial statements included therein would
become stale); and (E) keep each of the Athena Form S-4 Registration Statement
and the Newco Registration Statements effective through the Closing in order
to permit the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Athena shall
cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall cause
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Athenas stockholders, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Athena Form S-4 Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act. Each of Athena and
Everest shall promptly furnish the other party all information concerning
such party, its Subsidiaries and stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
or circumstance shall be discovered by either Athena or Everest, or either
Athena or Everest becomes aware of any information furnished by it, in either
case, that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Athena
Form S-4 Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Newco
Registration Statements or the Schedule TO (if applicable) so that such
document or documents would not include any untrue statement of a material
fact or fail to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then such party: (i) shall promptly inform the other
party thereof; (ii) shall provide the other party (and its Representatives)
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Athena Form S-4 Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Newco Registration Statements or the Schedule TO (if
applicable) prior to it being filed with the SEC; (iii) shall provide the
other party with a copy of such amendment or supplement promptly after it is
filed with the SEC; and (iv) shall cooperate, if appropriate, in mailing such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of Athena or Everest (as the case
may be).

 



48

    

(b) Each of Athena and Everest will also take all commercially reasonable
actions (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with, in the case of the Athena, the issuance of
Athena Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and, in the case of Everest, the
issuance of shares of Newco Common Stock in the Distribution. If any state
Takeover Statute or similar Legal Requirement shall become applicable to the
Contemplated Transactions, each of the parties and their respective boards of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions within their
control as are reasonably necessary so that the Contemplated Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or
by the other Transaction Documents and otherwise take such actions within
their control to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Contemplated Transactions.

the Merger pursuant to New York Stock Exchange Listing Rule 312.03 and (ii)
shall submit such proposal to such holders at the Athena Stockholders
Meeting. Athena shall not submit any other proposals for approval at the
Athena Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Everest,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld in the event the
Athena Stockholders Meeting is also an annual meeting of Athenas
stockholders. Athena in consultation with Everest shall set a record date for
Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Athena Stockholders
Meeting. Athena shall not change such record date for the Athena
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Everest and shall
not adjourn or otherwise postpone or delay the Athena Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Everest; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Athena may, without the prior written consent of Everest, adjourn or postpone
the Athena Stockholders Meeting (i) if as of the time for which the Athena
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Athena Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Athena Stockholders Meeting, (ii) after consultation with
Everest, to the extent necessary to ensure the distribution of any supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by Legal Requirements within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Athena Stockholders Meeting or,
(iii) if there are insufficient affirmative votes represented (either in

in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Athena agrees that,

(b) Except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_: (i)
the Athena Board shall recommend that Athenas stockholders vote in favor of
the issuance of shares of Athena Common Stock pursuant to the Merger at the
Athena Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall include a statement to the effect that the Athena Board recommends that
Athenas stockholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of Athena Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger at the Athena Stockholders Meeting (such
determination and recommendation being referred to as the " _Athena Board
Recommendation_ ") and (iii) the Athena Board Recommendation shall not be
directly or indirectly withdrawn, modified or qualified (or proposed to be
withdrawn, modified or qualified) by the Athena Board or any committee
thereof in a manner adverse to Everest (an " _Athena Change in Recommendation_
").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_, at any time prior to the approval of the issuance of shares of
Athena Common Stock pursuant to the Merger by the Required Athena Stockholder
Vote, the Athena Board may (x) effect, or cause Athena to effect, as the case
may be, an Athena Change in Recommendation and (y) only in the case of
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)(i)_ below, terminate or cause Athena to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ and concurrently with such
termination cause Athena to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
an Athena Superior Offer (subject to the satisfaction of its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_):

 

(i) if: (A) Athena has not materially breached its obligations under _Section_
__ _ 4.5_; (B) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal is made to Athena and is not withdrawn; (C) the
Athena Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes an Athena Superior Offer; (D) the Athena Board does not effect, or
cause Athena to effect, an Athena Change in Recommendation at any time within
four (4) Business Days (together with any subsequent shorter period as
contemplated by the proviso below in this clause (D), the " _Notice Period_ ")
after Everest receives (x) written notice from Athena that the Athena Board
has determined that such Acquisition Proposal is an Athena Superior Offer and
(y) a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
and other information required to be provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.5_
( _provided_  that a new notice shall be required with respect to each
material modification to such offer (it being understood that any change in
the purchase price or form of consideration in such offer shall be deemed a
material modification) and a new Notice Period (of two (2) Business Days)
shall begin); (E) during the applicable Notice Period, if requested by
Everest, Athena engages in good faith negotiations, and directs its financial
advisors and outside legal advisors to, engage in good faith negotiations,
with Everest to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the competing
Acquisition Proposal does not constitute an Athena Superior Offer; (F) at the
end of the applicable Notice Period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been
withdrawn and constitutes an Athena Superior Offer (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Everest as a result of the
negotiations required by clause (E) or otherwise); and (G) the Athena
Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Athena Superior Offer, a failure to make an
Athena Change in Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement would
reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
Athena Board to Athena stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; or

 



50

    

(ii) if other than in connection with or as a result of the making of
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Athena or an Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to Athena, a material development or change in circumstances that was
not known or reasonably foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable,
the probability or magnitude of consequences of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable) to the Athena Board on the date of this Agreement
occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement, which material development
or change in circumstances becomes known to the Athena Board prior to the
approval of the issuance of shares of Athena Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger by the Required Athena Stockholder Vote (such material development or
change in circumstances being referred to as an " _Intervening Event_ ") (it
being understood that that in no event shall (x) any action taken by either
party pursuant to and in compliance with the affirmative covenants set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, and the consequences of any such action or (y) the
receipt, existence of or terms of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Athena or an Acquisition Inquiry with respect to Athena or the consequences
thereof constitute an Intervening Event); (A) the Athena Board determines in
its good faith judgment, after consulting with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel that an Intervening Event has occurred; (B) the Athena
Board does not effect, or cause Athena to effect, an Athena Change
in Recommendation at any time within four (4) Business Days after Everest
receives written notice from Athena that the Athena Board has determined that
an Intervening Event requires the Athena Board to effect, or cause Athena to
effect, an Athena Change in Recommendation ( _provided_ that a new notice
shall be required with respect to any change in circumstances and a new notice
period of two (2) Business Days shall begin); (C) during such applicable
period, if requested by Everest, Athena engages in good faith negotiations,
and directs its financial advisors and outside legal advisors to, engage in
good faith negotiations, with Everest to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for the Athena Board to effect, or cause Athena to
effect, an Athena Change in Recommendation as a result of such Intervening
Event; and (D) the Athena Board determines in good faith, after having
consulted with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening
Event, a failure to make an Athena Change in Recommendation would reasonably
be likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Athena Board
to Athenas stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Athena Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Athena
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Athena Board to make such disclosure would constitute
a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Athena Board under applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in no event shall this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ permit the Athena Board to make an Athena Change in
Recommendation except as otherwise permitted expressly pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.2(c)_, (B) in no event shall this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ affect,
modify or supplement the definition of Athena Change in Recommendation herein
(or to the consequences thereof in accordance with this Agreement) and (C) any
such public disclosure (other than issuance by Athena of a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) that does not state that the Athena Board
Recommendation has not changed shall be deemed to be an Athena Change in
Recommendation. Athena shall provide Everest with a copy of the text of any
disclosure proposed to be made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ at the
earliest practicable time in advance of such disclosure.

Section 5.3 _Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters_.

 

(a) Each party shall file all notices, reports and other documents required to
be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger
and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional
information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ below, Athena and
Everest each shall, promptly (and in any event, with respect to clause (x),
within 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement), prepare and file
(x) the notifications required under the HSR Act and (y) the
mandatory notifications required under any applicable foreign Competition
Laws (the " _Antitrust Filings_ ") in connection with the Merger. Athena and
Everest each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act, and Athena and
Everest shall each (i) cooperate with the other party in connection with any
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly
supply the other party with any information which may be required in order to
effectuate notices, reports, documents or other filings with any Governmental
Body required to be made pursuant to the HSR Act and the Antitrust Filings;
and (iii) promptly supply any additional information which reasonably may be
required by any Governmental Body in connection with Antitrust Filings or
which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate. Each of Athena and Everest
will notify the other party promptly upon the receipt of (and, if in writing,
share a copy of) any material communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, any Governmental Bodies and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any Antitrust Filings, Athena or Everest, as the
case may be, will promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Body (and share a copy
of) such amendment or supplement. Each of Athena and Everest shall give the
other party prompt notice of the commencement or known threat of commencement
of any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions, shall keep the other
party reasonably informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or
threat, and, in connection with any such Legal Proceeding, will permit
authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to any such Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any such Legal
Proceeding.

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Athena, Everest, Merger Sub and Newco agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or advisable
to satisfy each of the conditions set forth in _Articles VI_ and _VII_ ,
consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated
Transactions ( _provided_ that no party shall be required to waive any of the
conditions set forth in _Articles VI_ or _VII_ , as applicable, to its
obligations to consummate the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions)
in each case as promptly as is reasonably practicable but in any event so as
to permit the Closing to occur prior to the End Date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, each
party to this Agreement agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) as
promptly as practicable, prepare and file all filings (if any) and give all
notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection
with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) obtain each
Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal
Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions (including Athena
providing a guarantee of Newco Companies obligations reasonably necessary to
obtain such Consents); and (iii) lift any restraint, injunction or other legal
bar to the Merger ( _provided_ that, other than fees and expenses of outside
counsel and other Representatives, except to the extent required pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ but subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, no party shall
be required to make any payment, assume any material

 



52

    

 obligations or offer or grant any material concessions to any Person (other
than any Governmental Bodies) to obtain any Consent). The parties shall
jointly devise, control and direct the strategy and timing for, and the
making of all material decisions relating to, obtaining any Consent of a
Governmental Body contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 

(c) Each party shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire or
agree to acquire any business or entity, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, if doing so would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, increase the risk of
not obtaining any consents of any Governmental Body necessary to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions or give rise to a requirement to obtain any
additional Governmental Authorizations not currently required to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions.

 

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth below in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_,
Athena agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its Subsidiaries
(including, for this purpose, from and after the Closing, the Newco
Companies)), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including by
its Subsidiaries (including, for this purpose, from and after the Closing,
the Newco Companies)), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, that a Governmental Body may assert under any Competition
Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
avoid or eliminate any impediment under any Competition Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, so as to enable the Closing to
occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the End Date,
including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the Athena Companies (including, for this purpose, from and
after the Closing, the Newco Companies), (y) creating, terminating, or
divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of any of
the Athena Companies (including, for this purpose, from and after the
Closing, the Newco Companies) and (z) otherwise taking or committing to take
any action that would limit any of the Athena Companies (including, for this
purpose, from and after the Closing, the Newco Companies) freedom of action
with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly,
any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of the
Athena Companies (including, for this purpose, from and after the Closing,
the Newco Companies), in each case as may be required in order to obtain all
expirations or terminations of waiting periods required under any Competition
Law or to avoid the commencement of any action by a Governmental Body to
prohibit the transactions contemplated by the Agreement under any Competition
Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in
any action or Legal Proceeding seeking to prohibit the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or delay the Closing beyond the End Date (each,
a " _Divestiture Action_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
Athena Companies (including, for this purpose, from and after the Closing,
the Newco Companies) shall be required to (and without the prior written
consent of Everest shall not) take any Divestiture Action that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Athena Companies, taken as a whole, after giving effect
to the Contemplated Transactions (including, for this purpose, treating the
Newco Companies as Athena Companies).

 

Section 5.4 _Disclosure_. Athena and Everest shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement

each of Athena, Everest, Newco, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates

settlement of any securityholder litigation against Everest and/or the

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) Athena shall give Everest the right to participate in the defense or
settlement of any securityholder litigation against Athena and/or the Athena
Board relating to the Contemplated Transactions. In no event shall Athena

non-litigating party will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to any securityholder litigation by the
litigating party (to the extent the attorney-client privilege between the
litigating party and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and
the non-litigating party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to
the litigation but will not be afforded any decision making power or authority

 breach of, or default under, any material Contract to which Everest or any

Legal Requirements. Neither Everest nor its Subsidiaries (including the Newco
Companies) shall be required (i) to provide access to or disclose information

reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of
Everest or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Newco Companies) or (ii) to
deliver or cause to be delivered any opinion of counsel in connection
with the Athena Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ shall require

that compliance with the requirements set forth in this clause (g) will not
unreasonably interfere with the business operations), encumber any of assets
prior to Closing, require the applicable party to pay any commitment or
similar fee in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing Date (unless

consent of Newco (such consent to be exercised in furtherance of _Section_ __
_ 5.5(a)_ and _ Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_ only and not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that, it is understood and agreed
that Athena may voluntarily prepay the terms loan obligations (other than with

harmless each Person who at the Effective Time is a present or former
director or officer of any Newco Company (each a " _D andO Indemnitee_") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
a DandO Indemnitee was a director or officer of a Newco Company at or prior to
the Effective Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Everest or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Newco Companies), as the case may be, would have
been permitted under the applicable Legal Requirements to indemnify such
Person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Athena and Newco and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each present and former director and
officer of any Newco Company and his or her heirs and representatives. In the
event that Athena or Newco or any of their

 



61

    

 respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Athena or Newco, as the
case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 5.15(b)_.

(c) Athena acknowledges that the DandO Indemnitees may have certain rights
to indemnification, insurance and/or advancement of expenses from other
Persons (directly or by insurance retained by such Person) (the " _Other
Indemnitors_ "). Athena hereby agrees and acknowledges that (i) it is the
indemnitor of first resort with respect to the DandO Indemnitees, (ii) it shall
be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by the DandO
Indemnitees, as required by the terms of this Agreement, without regard to any
rights the DandO Indemnitees may have against the Other Indemnitors and (iii)
it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors from
any and all claims against the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation
or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Athena further agrees
that no advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of Everest
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any claim for which the DandO
Indemnitees have sought indemnification from such Entities shall affect the
foregoing and the Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or
be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the
rights of recovery of the DandO Indemnitees against Everest or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ or otherwise in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, whether or not the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions are

any limitation of any other rights or remedies of Everest or Newco hereunder
in connection with such termination (including, if applicable, Everests
right to receive payment of any Athena Termination Fee), Athena shall
reimburse Everest for an amount equal to $25,000,000 in the aggregate as
partial reimbursement of Everests fees and expenses incurred by Everest and

with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions (including fees and
expenses of Everests or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Newco

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated (x) by Everest pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_, or (y) by Athena pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated (x) by either Athena or Everest pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or (y) by Everest pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_, and (A) after the date of this Agreement but
before any such termination an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Athena
shall have been made or communicated to Athena (and not withdrawn publicly if
made or communicated publicly) or shall have become publicly known by the
stockholders of Athena, and (B) within twelve (12) months after such
termination Athena shall have entered into a definitive agreement to
consummate, or shall have consummated an Acquisition Transaction; _provided_
that for purposes of this clause (B) all references in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction to 20% shall instead refer to 50%;

then Athena shall pay to Everest, in cash by wire transfer of same-day funds
to an account or accounts designated by Everest, a nonrefundable fee in the

(1) in the case of a termination by Everest pursuant to clause (b)(i) above,
within two Business Days after termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case

simultaneously with such termination, or (3) in the case of a termination
pursuant to clause (b)(ii) above, upon the earlier of the entry into a
definitive agreement to consummate, or the consummation of, an Acquisition
Transaction; _provided_ that, to the extent the Everest Expense Reimbursement
was actually previously paid to and received by Everest, such amount shall be
credited against the Athena Termination Fee.

 



68

    

(c) If Athena fails to pay when due any amount payable under this  _Section_
__ _ 8.3_, then: (i) Athena shall reimburse Everest for all costs and
expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection
with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by Everest of
its rights under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_; and (ii) Athena shall pay to
Everest interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the
date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid through the date
such overdue amount is actually paid to the other party in full) at a rate per
annum equal to the lower of: (A) 350 basis points over the "prime rate" (as
published in the Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid or (B) the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Athena be obligated to pay more than one Athena Termination
Fee.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Everests
right to receive payment of the Athena Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.3(b)_ shall, in circumstances in which the Athena Termination Fee is
payable hereunder and is paid in full (absent fraud or any willful and
material breach of this Agreement), be deemed to be liquidated damages (and
not a penalty) and shall, except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_,
be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Everest and Newco against Athena
and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling Persons, managers,
members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives, agents
or assignees or successors (collectively, " _Athena Related Parties_ ")
for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for
a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or
other document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of
any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Athena
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement (except that Athena remains obligated to pay to
Everest any amounts due and payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_, including as and if applicable the Everest Expense
Reimbursement), whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, while Everest and Newco may pursue both
a grant of specific performance and the payment of the Athena Termination Fee
(in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), under no
circumstances shall Everest and Newco be permitted or entitled to receive both
a grant of specific performance and the Athena Termination Fee.

Section 9.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Remedies_.
This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise

of Delaware or, to the extent required by Legal Requirements, any federal
court in the State of Delaware, with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in this paragraph. The parties hereto

Section 9.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement (or

enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with
a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.
