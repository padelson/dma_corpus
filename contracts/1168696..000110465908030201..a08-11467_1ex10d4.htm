 **PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT**

  



  

This PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated January 14,
2008, and made by and among Consolidated Theatres, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Parent_ "), the corporations (other than Purchaser)
identified on the signature pages hereto (collectively, the " _Corporations_
", and together with Parent, each a " _Seller_ " and, together, the "
_Sellers_ "), Consolidated Theatres Holdings, GP, a North Carolina
partnership (the " _Partnership_ "), and Regal Cinemas, Inc., a Tennessee
corporation (" _Purchaser_ ").  Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in _Section 10.2_.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Partnership, and its Subsidiaries identified on _Exhibit A_
hereto (collectively, with the Partnership, the " _Companies_ ") operate a
chain of cinemas located in the Southeastern United States;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Corporations own 100% of the outstanding Equity Securities
(excluding the Options (as defined below)) of the Partnership (collectively,
the " _Partnership Interests_ "), and Parent owns 100% of the outstanding
capital stock of each of the Corporations;

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent owns 100% of the outstanding options to purchase all of the
Partnership Interests (collectively, the " _Options_ ") from the Corporations
for an aggregate exercise price (the " _Option Exercise Price_ ") of
$41,910,614.83; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to purchase from Sellers, and Sellers desire to
sell to Purchaser, all the assets of the Companies through the purchase (1)
from Parent of the Options, and (2) from the Corporations of the Partnership
Interests upon the exercise of the Options, in each case subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and for other consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I 
  
 PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING**

  



  

 **SECTION 1.1. Transfer of Options and Partnership Interests**.

  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, Parent shall
sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
acquire at the Closing, the Options. Immediately following such purchase and
sale of the Options, Purchaser shall exercise the Options by delivering to
the Corporations an exercise notice (the " _Exercise Notice_ ") substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and paying the Option Exercise
Price, and Purchaser and Sellers shall consummate the purchase and sale of
the Partnership Interests as set forth herein. Each Corporation agrees that
the exercise by the Purchaser at the Closing of the Option granted by such
Corporation, on the terms of this Agreement instead of pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the contribution agreement pursuant to which such
Option was granted, will constitute a valid exercise of such Option.

        
   

  



  

 **SECTION 1.2. Closing**.

  



  

The closing of the purchase and sale of the Options and the Partnership
Interests pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall occur at the
offices of Hogan and Hartson L.L.P., 1200 Seventeenth Street, Suite 1500,
Denver, Colorado, at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second Thursday following
full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof (other than those to be satisfied by actions to be taken
at the Closing), or such other time and place as may be mutually agreed. The
date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

  



  

 **SECTION 1.3. Purchase Price; Closing Cash Payment**.

  



  

### (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, as
consideration for the purchase of the Options, Purchaser shall pay to Parent
an aggregate purchase price equal to the Enterprise Value _less_ the Option
Exercise Price (the " _Option Purchase Price_ "). The
aggregate consideration for the Transactions (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall
be an amount equal to (i) the Option Exercise Price _plus_ (ii) the Option
Purchase Price, as adjusted in accordance with _Section 1.5_.

  

### 

  

### (b) Not fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent
shall deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_
") setting forth ParentÂ’s good faith estimates of the amounts of Closing
Working Capital and Closing Cash as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the Closing
Date (the " _Adjustment Time_ "), and a calculation of the Enterprise Value
and Option Purchase Price based on the foregoing estimates (the " _Estimated
Enterprise Value_ " and " _Estimated Option Purchase Price_ ," respectively).

  

### 

  

### (c) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay in cash (i) to the
Corporations, the Option Exercise Price, (ii) to the Parent, a portion of the
Estimated Option Purchase Price (the " _Closing Cash Payment_ ") equal to
the Estimated Option Purchase Price less (A) the amounts paid pursuant
to clause (iii) below in respect of the Bank Facility and (B) the
Escrow Amount, and (iii) on behalf of the Companies (and each of the Sellers
as guarantors), all amounts then due under the Bank Facility (including
all prepayment premiums, penalties or other like charges) as set forth in
the payoff letter delivered to Purchaser as provided in _Section
7.2(c)(vii)_, with the effect that the Bank Facility and related
documentation shall be terminated effective as of the Closing (other than any
provision thereof that, by its terms, survives such repayment).  For
illustrative purposes only, _Schedule 1.3(c) _attached hereto sets forth an
example of the calculation of the cash payments to be made at Closing in
accordance with this _Section 1.3(c)_.

  

### 

  

 **SECTION 1.4. Closing Deliveries**.

  



  

### (a) _Closing Deliveries by Sellers_. To effect the transactions referred
to in _Section 1.1_ (the " _Transactions_ "), Sellers shall, on the Closing
Date, deliver to Purchaser the following:

  

### 

  

#### (i) one or more instruments transferring to Purchaser the Options and
the Partnership Interests, in form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser;

  



        
   

  



  

#### (ii) copies of all consents, approvals, releases, and waivers from
Governmental Entities and other third parties, including Landlord Approvals,
relating to the Transactions that have been obtained; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) all other documents required to be delivered by Sellers pursuant
to _Article VII_ not specifically mentioned above in this _Section 1.4(a)_.

  

#### 

  

All instruments and documents executed and delivered to Purchaser pursuant
hereto shall be in form and substance, and shall be executed in a manner,
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and its counsel.

  



  

### (b) _Closing Deliveries by Purchaser_. To effect the Transactions,
Purchaser shall, on the Closing Date, deliver the following:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Exercise Notice;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) the Closing Cash Payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account (the " _Seller Account_ ") designated by Parent not fewer
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) the Option Exercise Price, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Seller Account (for the account of the Corporations);

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) the Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the Escrow Agent; and

  

#### 

  

#### (v) all other documents required to be delivered by Purchaser pursuant
to _Article VII_ not specifically mentioned above in this _Section 1.4(b)_.

  

#### 

  

All instruments and documents executed and delivered to Sellers pursuant
hereto shall be in form and substance, and shall be executed in a manner,
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its counsel.

  



  

### (c) _Other Actions to be Taken prior to and at the Closing_. To further
facilitate the Transactions: (i) not fewer than seven (7) nor greater than
fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will deliver to the
Commonwealth 20 Landlord notice of the Closing Date, as required by Section 3
of the Commonwealth 20 Landlord Agreement, (ii) on or prior to the Closing
Date, Purchaser will cause to be delivered to the Commonwealth 20 Landlord
the REG Guaranty (as that term is defined in the Commonwealth 20 Landlord
Agreement), duly executed by each of Purchaser, Regal Entertainment Group, a
Delaware corporation, Regal Entertainment Holdings and Regal Cinemas
Corporation, and Purchaser will cause the Security Deposit (as that term is
defined in the Commonwealth 20 Lease) to be delivered to the Commonwealth 20
Landlord as contemplated by Section 2 of the Commonwealth 20 Landlord
Agreement, each in accordance with the Commonwealth 20 Landlord Agreement,
and (iii) Sellers will complete the list of deferred maintenance items as set
forth on page 3 of the Wells Fargo Annual Property Inspection Report relating
to the inspection of the Commonwealth 20 building on August 19, 2007 prior to
the Closing Date, but in no event later than 90 days after January 7, 2008.

  



        
   

  



  

 **SECTION 1.5. Adjustment to Purchase Price**.

  



  

### (a) No later than the 75th day after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a consolidated balance sheet of the Companies
as of the Adjustment Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth PurchaserÂ’s
determination of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and Enterprise Value,
and a calculation of the Purchase Price based on the foregoing
determinations.  Purchaser shall prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein) in
accordance with _Section 1.5(e)_.

  

### 

  

### (b) During the 30-day period immediately following ParentÂ’s receipt of
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (or during the 30-day
period immediately following the 75-day period described in _Section
1.5(a)_, if Purchaser fails to deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement to Parent within the 75-day period provided in _Section
1.5(a)_ (in which case, for purposes of this Section 1.5(b), the Estimated
Closing Certificate shall be treated as the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement and will be deemed to have been delivered to Parent on the
75th day after the Closing Date)), Parent and its advisors and
representatives (i) shall be permitted to review, upon reasonable notice, the
CompaniesÂ’ books and records and the working papers related to the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including
the determinations included therein), and (ii) shall be given reasonable
access, upon reasonable notice, to knowledgeable employees and accounting
professionals of Purchaser and the Companies in order to facilitate ParentÂ’s
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement; _provided_
that the review and access described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be
conducted at times and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the operation of PurchaserÂ’s or the CompaniesÂ’ respective businesses.  The
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the determinations
included therein) shall become final, binding and conclusive upon Purchaser
and Sellers (A) on the 30th day following ParentÂ’s receipt thereof, unless
Purchaser receives from Parent prior to such 30th day written notice of
ParentÂ’s disagreement (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") with any account
or determination set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing
Statement or (B) on such earlier date as Parent notifies Purchaser that it
does not dispute the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement. If Parent
timely delivers a Dispute Notice, then the determination of the Purchase
Price shall become final, binding and conclusive upon Purchaser and Sellers
on the first to occur of (x) the date on which Purchaser and Parent resolve
in writing all differences they have with respect to the disputed items or
(y) the date on which all of the disputed items that are not resolved by
Purchaser and Parent in writing are finally resolved in writing by the
Independent Accountants in accordance with _Section 1.5(c)_.

  

### 

  

### (c) During the 30 days following delivery of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser
and Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
that they have with respect to the disputed items. Any disputed
item resolved in writing by Purchaser and Parent shall be deemed final,
binding and conclusive on Purchaser and Sellers. If Purchaser and Parent do
not reach agreement on all of the disputed items during such 30-day period
(or such longer period as they shall mutually agree), then at the end of such
30-day (or longer) period Purchaser and Parent shall submit all unresolved
disputed items (collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to Ernst and Young
LLP (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") to review and resolve such matters
and each will specify to the other and to the Independent Accountant its
determination of the amount of the

  



        
   

  



  

### Purchase Price (a partyÂ’s " _Proposed Price_ "). The Independent
Accountants will determine each Unresolved Item in accordance with this
_Section 1.5(c)_ and  _Section 1.5(e)_ as promptly as may be reasonably
practicable, and Purchaser and Parent shall instruct the Independent
Accountants to endeavor to complete such process within a period of no more
than 60 days. The Independent Accountants may conduct such proceedings as the
Independent Accountants believe, in their sole discretion, will assist in the
determination of the Unresolved Items; _provided_ that, except as Purchaser
and Parent may otherwise agree in writing, all communications between
Purchaser and Parent or any of their respective representatives, on the one
hand, and the Independent Accountants, on the other hand, shall be in writing
with copies simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party. The
Independent AccountantsÂ’ determination of the Unresolved Items shall be
final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and Sellers, effective as of the
date the Independent AccountantsÂ’ written determination is received by
Purchaser and Parent. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants
shall be borne as follows: (x) by Parent, in a portion equal to a fraction,
the numerator of which is the absolute difference between ParentÂ’s Proposed
Price and the Purchase Price determined by the Independent Accountants and
the denominator of which is the absolute difference between ParentÂ’s Proposed
Price and the PurchaserÂ’s Proposed Price, and (y) by Purchaser, in a portion
equal to one (1) minus the fraction described in the preceding clause (x).

  

### 

  

### (d) Within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_ or _Section 1.5(c)_ (the "
_Final Purchase Price_ "), either (i) if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds
the Final Purchase Price, then Parent will pay to Purchaser the amount
of such excess, or (ii) if the Final Purchase Price exceeds the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Purchaser will pay to Parent the amount of
such excess. Any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 1.5(d)_ will
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
specified by the party to receive such payment.

  

### 

  

### (e) For the purposes of this Agreement, each accounting term will have
the meaning that is applied thereto in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") as in effect on
December 31, 2006 and, to the extent consistent with GAAP as in effect on
December 31, 2006, the accounting principles, policies, procedures and
methodologies applied in preparing the balance sheet that is part of the
Audited Financial Statements and the accompanying statement of income.  Each
account included in the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet shall
be (i) calculated in accordance with GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2006,
and, to the extent consistent with GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2006,
utilizing the accounting principles, policies, procedures and methodologies
applied in preparing the Company Financial Statements (without regard to
materiality), including with respect to the nature or classification
of accounts, and determining levels of reserves or levels of accruals; and
(ii) consistent with the books and records of the Companies and the
definitions herein; _provided_  that in determining current assets and
liabilities hereunder, (A) all accounting entries shall be taken into account
regardless of their amount and all known errors and omissions shall be
corrected, (B) all known proper adjustments shall be made, and (C)
appropriate reserves for all known and quantifiable liabilities and
obligations for which reserves are appropriate in accordance with GAAP as in
effect on December 31, 2006 shall be included.

  



        
   

  



  

 **SECTION 1.6. Escrow.**

  



  

At the Closing, the Escrow Amount shall be paid to the Escrow Agent as
described in _Section 1.4_ and deposited by the Escrow Agent into an
interest-bearing escrow account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. On the
Business Day after the Survival Date, the portion of the Escrow Amount then
held by the Escrow Agent, plus any interest or other earnings on the Escrow
Amount and then held by the Escrow Agent, less the aggregate amount of any
unresolved outstanding claims on the Escrow Account made by the Seller-
Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section 8.3_, shall be distributed to
Parent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Purchaser shall be
entitled to be paid from the Escrow Amount and any interest or other earnings
on the Escrow Amount, in each case held by the Escrow Agent from time to
time, any amount that any Seller is required to pay to Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement that has not been paid to Purchaser in accordance with the
provisions hereof and any indemnity payment required to be made by Sellers
pursuant to _Article VIII_ of this Agreement, in each case pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

 **SECTION 1.7. Retained Leases.**

  



  

Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Partnership and the Companies have no
right, title or interest in or to that certain (i) Lease Agreement dated
March 18, 2001 by and between Remington San Simeon, L.L.C. and Consolidated
Theatres, as amended, and (ii) Lease Agreement dated as of November 8, 1993
by and between Fairview Plaza Associates Limited Partnership and Consolidated
Theatres, Inc., as amended, which leases and all obligations and liabilities
associated therewith shall be retained in their entirety by Sellers.

  



  

# **ARTICLE II

 **SECTION 3.10. Employee Benefit Plans**.

  



  

### (a) _Schedule 3.10_ sets forth a true and complete list of each
"employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), and each
other employee benefit, fringe, equity based compensation,
retention, employment, severance, change in control, or bonus plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement that is sponsored, maintained, participated
in or contributed to as of the date of this Agreement by any Company or any
entity required to be aggregated with any Company with respect to which any
Company has any material liability (collectively, the " _Benefit Plans_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, Sellers have made available to
Purchaser, to the extent applicable (i) the plan document, all amendments to
the plan document, the summary plan description and any summaries of material
modifications; (ii) the most recent determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service; (ii) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500
series); (iv) the related trust agreements, insurance contract or other
funding arrangement, (v) the most recent discrimination testing results and
(vi) all material correspondence with the IRS or the Department of Labor.

  

### 

  

### (c) No Company or, to the SellersÂ’ Knowledge, any other person has
engaged in any non-exempt "prohibited transaction", as defined in Code
Section 4975 or ERISA Section 406, with respect to any Benefit Plan. To the
SellersÂ’ Knowledge, no Company has engaged in any transaction that as a
result of which any Company would be subject to any material liability
pursuant to Sections 406 and 409 of ERISA or to either a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) or (l) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975 of the Code. No fiduciary of any Benefit Plan has any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply
in connection with the administration or investment of the assets of
any Benefit Plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) None of the Benefit Plans is a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, the
minimum funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code, and no Company has ever maintained, participated in or contributed to
any plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the minimum funding
requirements of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Company
has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA and no events have
occurred and no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to
result in such liability to any Company. No Company has any liability or
obligation as a consequence of being considered a single employer under
Section 414 of the Code with any other Person.

  

### 

  

### (e) No Benefit Plan is or ever has been a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of ERISA Section 3(37). No Company has any liability for a
complete or partial withdrawal from any multiemployer plan or has any
liability under or with respect to any multiemployer plan.  No Benefit Plan
is a "voluntary employeesÂ’ beneficiary association" within the meaning of

  



        
   

  



  

### Code Section 501(c)(9) or a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Code Section 409A.

  

### 

  

### (f) Each Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract, or
fund) has been maintained, funded and administered in all material respects
in compliance with its governing documents and with all provisions of all
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

  

### 

  

### (g) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be " _qualified_ " within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so
qualified by issuance and receipt of a favorable determination letter or
reliance upon a prototype opinion letter. No event has occurred since the date
of the most recent determination letter (other than the effective date of
certain amendments to the Code the remedial amendment period for which has
not expired) that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of such Benefit Plan.

  

### 

  

### (h) There are no claims (other than routine claims for benefits),
proceedings, hearings, actions or lawsuits pending, or to the SellersÂ’
Knowledge, threatened, with respect to any Benefit Plan. There are no audits,
investigations or examinations with respect to any Benefit Plan by the IRS,
the Department of Labor, the PBGC or any other governmental agency (other
than a review associated with the application for a determination letter that
has been filed with the IRS) and, to the SellersÂ’ Knowledge, no such audit,
investigation or examination is threatened or pending.

  

### 

  

### (i) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) and premium payments that are due with
respect to any Benefit Plan have been made within the time periods prescribed
by ERISA and the Code to each such Benefit Plan.

  

### 

  

### (j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will (i) result in the payment of any money
or property to any employee of any Company, (ii) materially increase any
benefit otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan; or (iii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of, any compensation
due from any Company to any employee.

  

### 

  

### (k) There are no agreements to which any Company is a party that will
provide payments to any officer, employee or highly compensated individual
that shall be "parachute payments" under Section 280G or Section 4999 of the
Code for which Purchaser or any Company will have withholding liability or
that will result in loss of Tax deductions under Section 280G of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (l) No Company has any obligation to provide life insurance, medical or
health benefit coverage on or after retirement or other termination of
employment to any individual other than continuation coverage as required by
Section 4980B of the Code.

  

###

or submissions to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies
of all material correspondence, filings or communications between any party
and any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. The
parties shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
reasonably practicable each will consult the other on, all information
relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions. The parties and their respective representatives shall have
the right to participate, to the extent reasonably practicable, in any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,

## **SECTION 6.4.** Public Announcements.

  

## ** **

  

Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Sellers shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to the Transactions and neither party shall issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the other partyÂ’s written
approval, except as may be required by Law, in which case the other party

mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued to the extent
practicable.

Management, LLC as of the Closing Date (and the COBRA-eligible former
employees of Consolidated Theatres Management, LLC as of the Closing Date)
shall be considered such "MandA qualified beneficiaries" regardless of whether
they technically satisfy the definition of "MandA qualified beneficiary" set
forth in Treas. Reg. Sec. 54.4980B-9. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
understood that any "MandA qualified beneficiary" who elects to receive COBRA
coverage from Purchaser must pay (or have paid on his or her behalf) the
COBRA premium amount in order to obtain such coverage. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of Purchaser, or any
Company to terminate the employment of any employee of any Company at any
time and for any or no reason on or after the Closing. No provision of this
_Section 6.5_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person,
including any employee or former employee of any Company or any beneficiary

contained in this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of Purchaser, the
Companies, or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or (iii) is intended to
confer upon any current or former employee of any Company or any other Person

reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of
employment.

### (b) If Purchaser takes any action within 180 days after the Closing Date
that independently, or in connection with any reduction in the size of the
CompaniesÂ’ work force occurring within the ninety day period prior to the

those terms are defined in the WARN Act, Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for providing any notice required by the WARN Act and for making
payments, if any, and paying all penalties and costs, if any, that may result
from any failure to provide such notice.

supplement(s) shall not be deemed to amend or supplement SellerÂ’s Schedules
for purposes of _Article VIII_ or prevent or cure any such breach for
purposes of _Article VIII_ or otherwise affect any rights of Purchaser under
Article VIII (except as provided in the proviso in the first sentence of

notification or supplement or any other notification or supplement delivered
pursuant to _Section 6.8(a)_ delivered to Purchaser prior to the first day
of such ten (10) Business Day period shall be deemed accepted by Purchaser
(other than for purposes of _Article VIII_), the condition to Closing set
forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed waived with respect to the matters
so disclosed in any such notification or supplement, and the disclosure
relative to SellersÂ’ representations and warranties shall be deemed modified
or supplemented as indicated in all such notifications and supplements for
purposes of _Article IX_.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) **** In addition to the foregoing, between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser of the
occurrence of any breach of any covenant of Sellers or the Companies in
_Article V_ or this _Article VI_ of the occurrence of any event that may
make the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article VII_ impossible or
unlikely.

  



  

## **SECTION 6.9.** Contacts with Suppliers, Customers and Other Parties.

  

## ** **

  

Without the prior written consent of Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and representatives not to, contact any suppliers or
independent contractors to, or customers of or any of the Companies, any
employees of any of the Companies, counterparties to any management agreement
or other contract to which any Company is a party, or any Governmental Entity
(other than in connection with any filings made under the HSR Act or in
connection with other consents, approvals or waivers required to be obtained
by Purchaser from Governmental Entities in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required by applicable Law) in connection with or
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **SECTION 6.10.** ** Kingstowne Litigation**.

  

## ** **

  

If the Kingstowne Litigation has not been resolved in its entirety by one or
more Final Judgments as of the Adjustment Time, then Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the Companies to assign, prior to the Closing,
all of the CompaniesÂ’ right, title and interest in and with respect to the
Kingstowne Litigation to Parent or ParentÂ’s designee (other than the
Companies), without any consideration to the Companies. In the event that the
Companies are prohibited from assigning the Kingstowne Litigation to Parent
or its designee prior to the Closing, or Parent reasonably concludes that
such an assignment could adversely affect the validity or value of such
claim, then from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Companies
to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the claims that are the
subject of the Kingstowne Litigation, including by means of an appeal of any
judgment rendered in connection therewith, and to collect any amount that
becomes payable to any Company in respect of such claims. In such event, at
any SellerÂ’s written request, Purchaser shall permit Sellers to conduct
the pursuit of such claims (including the settlement or other compromise
and/or the collection of any such amount) on behalf of the Companies using
legal counsel selected by Sellers that is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser,
and will cause the Companies to cooperate with Sellers in the pursuit of such
claims and the collection of any such amount as any Seller may reasonably
request. In the event that Sellers elect to conduct the pursuit of such
claims and/or the collection of any such amount:

  



  

### (a) Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Company to,
settle or otherwise comprise any such claim (including by consenting to the
entry of any judgment) without ParentÂ’s prior written consent;

  

### 

  

### (b) Sellers will (i) reimburse Purchaser for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by any Company in connection with the pursuit of such claims and/or
the collection of any such

  



        
   

  



  

amount that becomes payable to any Company, within five (5) Business Days
after such entityÂ’s payment thereof and notice to Sellers and (ii) pay to
Purchaser reasonable compensation for man-hours expended in the pursuit of
such claims; and

  

### 

  

### (c) Purchaser will cause the Companies to pay over to Sellers any amount
delivered to the Companies in respect of such claims, within five (5)
Business Days after such entityÂ’s receipt thereof.

  

### 

  

Without limiting the foregoing, if an assignment of the type described in the
first sentence of this _Section 6.10_ does not occur at or prior to the
Closing, then after the Closing, at ParentÂ’s expense, Purchaser will take
such actions as Parent may reasonably request to effectuate such an
assignment.

  



  

## **SECTION 6.11.** Landlord Approvals, Estoppels; SNDAs; Memoranda of
Leases.

  

## ** **

  

### (a) With respect to each Lease for which a Landlord Approval is required,
Sellers shall promptly after the date of this Agreement request that the
lessor thereunder grant such Landlord Approval. In connection with such
request, Purchaser shall furnish to such landlord all materials required by
the related Lease as a condition to or in connection with such a request, and
such other information as such landlord may reasonably request from time to
time. Purchaser and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain each Landlord Approval. Within five (5) calendar days of receipt of
any Landlord Approval executed by any such lessor, Sellers shall deliver a
true and complete copy thereof to Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### (b) With respect to each Lease, Sellers shall promptly after the date of
this Agreement request that the lessor thereunder execute an estoppel (a "
_Lessor Estoppel_ ") in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto. Sellers and
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain such a Lessor
Estoppel from each such lessor. Sellers and Purchaser shall make such
modifications to the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ as such lessors
shall reasonably request.  Within five (5) calendar days of receipt of any
Lessor Estoppel executed by any such lessor, Sellers shall deliver a true and
complete copy thereof to Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### (c) With respect to each Lease which is a sublease, Sellers shall
promptly after the date of this Agreement request that each superior lessor
execute a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement in form and
substance reasonably requested by Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain such a non-disturbance agreement,
and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser; _provided_
 that Sellers shall have no such obligation with respect to any superior
lessor that has previously executed such a commercially reasonable non-
disturbance agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### (d) With respect to each Lease which is, or may be, subordinate to a
mortgage or deed of trust executed by the lessor, or by a superior lessor,
Sellers shall promptly after the date of this Agreement request that the
mortgagee or beneficiary of each such deed of trust execute a non-disturbance
agreement in form and substance reasonably requested by Purchaser.  Sellers
and

  



        
   

  



  

Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain such a non-
disturbance agreement; _provided_  that Sellers shall have no such obligation
with respect to any mortgagee or beneficiary that has previously executed
such a non-disturbance agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### (e) With respect to each Lease for which a memorandum of lease is not
recorded in the official real property records in which the Leased Real
Property is located, Sellers shall promptly after the date of this Agreement
request that the lessor thereunder execute a memorandum of lease in form and
substance reasonably requested by Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain such memoranda of lease, duly
executed and acknowledged by such lessor and otherwise in recordable form.
Within five (5) calendar days of receipt by Sellers of any such memorandum
executed by any such lessor, Sellers shall deliver a true and complete copy
thereof to Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### (f) Purchaser may refuse to approve a lessor consent or estoppel on any
reasonable grounds. Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
releases of all guaranties of any CompanyÂ’s obligations given by any Person
under any Lease, including furnishing any guaranties, additional deposits,
letters of credit or other security for performance of the lesseeÂ’s
obligations under any of the Leases that any landlord may reasonably request.

  

### 

  

### (g) Notwithstanding anything set forth in any estoppel, consent, non-
disturbance agreement or other memorandum which is executed or delivered
pursuant to this _Section 6.11_, as between Purchaser and Sellers, this
Agreement shall govern the rights, interests, obligations and liabilities
under and with respect to the Leases.

  

### 

  

## **SECTION 6.12.** Non-Competition Agreement Amendment.

  

## ** **

  

Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause _Section 7(a)_ of the Executive Employment Agreement dated as of
November 1, 2003 between Consolidated Theatres Management, L.L.C. and E.
Casey Brock II (the " _Brock Employment Agreement_ ") to be amended to delete
the proviso to the second sentence thereof.

  



  

## **SECTION 6.13.** ABRY Indemnification Letter.

  

## ** **

  

Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall obtain the agreement of ABRY Partners,
LLC or an affiliate thereof reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (" _ABRY_ ")
to execute and deliver at Closing an indemnification letter for the benefit
of Purchaser substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ attached hereto (the "
_ABRY Indemnification Letter_ ").

the transactions provided for herein.

  



  

# **ARTICLE VIII 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  

# ** **

  

## **SECTION 8.1.** Indemnification of Purchaser.

  

## ** **

  

### (a) Sellers agree that, after the Closing, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article VIII_, Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its officers, directors, agents and representatives
(each hereinafter referred to individually as a " _Seller-Indemnified Person_
" and collectively as " _Seller-Indemnified Persons_ "), from and against any
and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of actions, losses, costs,
damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid, including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, costs of investigation or settlement, other
professionalsÂ’ and expertsÂ’ fees, and court or arbitration costs but
specifically excluding (except to the extent the same may be awarded to a
third party in a Third-Party Claim) consequential damages, lost profits,
indirect damages, punitive damages and exemplary damages (collectively
referred to as " _Damages_ "), to have arisen out of or to have resulted
from, in connection with, or by virtue of (i) facts or circumstances that
constitute an inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, default in, or
failure to perform, any of the representations, warranties or covenants given
or made by Sellers in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant
to _Section 7.2(c)(i)_ (collectively, the " _Limited-Indemnity Items_ "),
(ii) the High Point Litigation, (iii) Closing Indebtedness, (iv) the leases
retained by Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.7_, or (v) any action, suit,
investigation, or proceeding disclosed on _Schedule 3.5_ with respect to
which the defense is not being provided or paid for by the insurer
(collectively with the Limited-Indemnity Items, the High Point Litigation,
Closing Indebtedness and the retained leases, the " _Seller Indemnified
Items_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, no Seller-Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ for any liability
to the extent such liability is actually reflected in the Closing Working
Capital used to determine the Final Purchase Price.

  

### 

  

### (b) Any claim for indemnification made by a Seller-Indemnified Person
under this _Section 8.1_ in respect of the Limited-Indemnity Items must be
asserted in a writing delivered to Sellers no later than the Survival Date
and, if asserted by such date, such claim shall survive the Survival Date
until final resolution thereof. The right to indemnification, reimbursement
or other remedy based upon such representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations shall not be affected by any investigation (including any
environmental investigation or assessment) conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date.
Except as provided in the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 8.1(c)_,
the waiver of any covenant or condition will not affect the right to
indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy.

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### (c) The aggregate liability of Sellers on account of all Limited-
Indemnity Items pursuant to _Section 8.1_ shall be limited to $12,000,000
(the " _Limited-Indemnity Cap_ "), and claims for Damages in respect of
Limited-Indemnity Items shall be limited to such amount, whether the Seller-
Indemnified Person in question is the Purchaser or another Seller-Indemnified
Person; provided that, if Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.8 prior to the Closing and does not do so, then the
Limited-Indemnity Cap will be reduced by the amount, if any, of the Limited
6.8 Liabilities included in determining the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment (but not by an amount that exceeds the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment).  Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller-Indemnified PersonsÂ’
sole recourse in respect of Limited-Indemnity Items shall be to the amounts
held from to time by the Escrow Agent and not theretofore released pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement. In addition, the indemnification provided for in
this _Section 8.1_ in respect of the Limited-Indemnity Items shall not apply
unless and until the aggregate Damages determined to be due for which one or
more Seller-Indemnified Persons seeks or has sought indemnification hereunder
in respect of Limited-Indemnity Items exceeds a cumulative aggregate of
$2,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the Seller-Indemnified
Persons shall, subject to the other limitations herein, be indemnified for
such Damages to the extent in excess of the Deductible. Notwithstanding
the foregoing limitations, Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser from and against
the entirety of any Damages arising from facts or circumstances that
constitute fraud or willful breach of any covenant by Sellers.

  

### 

  

### (d) In view of the Deductible, and solely for purposes of determining the
amount of any Damages, the representations and warranties of Sellers set
forth in this Agreement (or in any instrument, certificate or affidavit
delivered at the Closing with respect thereto) shall be considered without
regard to any qualification based on materiality or "Material Adverse Effect"
set forth therein.

  

### 

  

### (e) The amount to which a Seller-Indemnified Person may become entitled
under this _Article VIII_ shall be net of any actual recovery (whether by
way of payment, discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise)
received from a third party (including any insurer) less any cost associated
with receiving such recovery in respect of a claim. To the extent that
insurance, "pass-through" warranty coverage from a manufacturer or other form
of recovery or reimbursement from a third party is available to any Seller-
Indemnified Person to cover any item for which indemnification may be sought
hereunder, Purchaser shall, or shall cause each other Seller-
Indemnified Person to, on a timely and expeditious basis, use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect recovery under applicable insurance policies,
and use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue to conclusion available
remedies or causes of action to recover the amount of its claim as may be
available from such other party; _provided_ that the availability of a
potential recovery against such a third party shall not affect PurchaserÂ’s
right to make a claim for indemnity pursuant to this _Section 8.1_. To the
extent of any indemnification with respect to any claim referred to in the
previous sentence, Purchaser shall assign, and Purchaser shall cause each
other Seller-Indemnified Person to assign, to Sellers, to the fullest extent
allowable, its claim against such insurance, warranty coverage or third-party
claim, or in the event assignment is not permissible, but Purchaser or the
other Seller-Indemnified Person in question is nonetheless permitted to
pursue such claim on SellersÂ’ behalf, Purchaser shall pursue, or shall cause
such other Seller-Indemnified Person to pursue, such claim, at SellersÂ’
direction and expense and without additional out-of-pocket expense to any
Seller-Indemnified Person, with

  



        
   

  



  

any recovery thereon to be transmitted promptly to Sellers upon receipt. To
the extent that indemnification has not been paid on account of any such
claim, any Seller-Indemnified Person may pursue recovery against such
insurance warranty coverage or third party and shall be entitled to retain
all recoveries made as a result of any such action. Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Companies to, furnish Sellers with such information
respecting the assets, business and financial records of Purchaser and the
Companies relating to any such claims as Sellers may, from time to time,
reasonably request and at the sole cost and expense of Sellers. After the
Closing, Purchaser shall maintain in effect, or will cause the Companies
to maintain in effect, in each case until the Survival Date, or for such
longer time as there remains a Contested Claim, insurance coverage in
amounts, and with coverage, not materially less favorable to the Companies
than the insurance coverage as maintained by the Companies as of the date of
this Agreement. In addition, the amount to which the Seller-Indemnified
Persons may become entitled under this _Article VIII_ shall be net of any
Tax benefits theretofore realized by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Companies, after the Closing) in respect of Damages to be indemnified
hereunder, and as and when Purchaser or any of its Affiliates realizes any
Tax benefits in respect of Damages theretofore indemnified hereunder,
Purchaser shall pay Parent an amount equal to the amount of such Tax benefit
so realized.

  

### 

  

### (f) Each Seller-Indemnified Person shall be responsible for taking or
causing to be taken reasonable steps to mitigate its Damages upon and after
becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to
Damages that may be indemnifiable under this _Article VIII_.

  

### 

  

 **SECTION 8.2.** ** Indemnification of Sellers**.

  



  

### (a) Purchaser agrees that, after the Closing, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article VIII_, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers, their officers, directors, agents, representatives, and
respective successors and assigns, and Herman Stone and any Affiliate of
Herman Stone with respect to clause (iii) of this _Section 8.2(a)_ (the "
_Purchaser-Indemnified Persons_ "), from and against any and all Damages
arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant made by Purchaser in this Agreement or in any of the
certificates or other instruments or documents furnished by Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)(i)_, (ii) the absence of any Landlord Approval
(whether or not such Landlord Approval is deemed to have been obtained for
purposes of _Section 7.2(d)_), or (iii) any guaranty entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement, or any Lease entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement as a co-tenant with a Company, by any Seller, Herman Stone or
any Affiliate of Herman Stone, to the extent relating to any liability or
other obligation of a Company arising after the Closing or reflected in the
Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Agreement (the
" _Purchaser Indemnified Items_ "). Any claim for indemnification made by
a Purchaser-Indemnified Person under clause (i) of this _Section 8.1_ in
respect of the Purchaser Indemnified Items must be asserted in a
writing delivered to Purchaser by no later than the Survival Date. The
aggregate liability of Purchaser on account of all Purchaser Indemnified
Items pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section 8.2(a)_ shall be limited to
the amount of the Limited Indemnity Cap, and claims for Damages in respect of
Purchaser Indemnified Items shall be limited to such amount, whether the
Purchaser-Indemnified Person in question is a Seller or another Purchaser-
Indemnified Person. In addition, the indemnification provided for in clause
(i) of this _Section 8.2(a)_ in respect of the Purchaser Indemnified Items
shall not apply unless

  



        
   

  



  

and until the aggregate Damages determined to be due for which one or more
Purchaser-Indemnified Persons seeks or has sought indemnification hereunder
in respect of Purchaser Indemnified Items exceeds the Deductible, in which
event the Purchaser-Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other
limitations herein, be indemnified for such Damages to the extent in excess
of the Deductible.

  

### 

  

### (b) In view of the Deductible, and solely for purposes of determining the
amount of any Damages, the representations and warranties of Purchaser set
forth in this Agreement (or in any instrument, certificate or affidavit
delivered at the Closing with respect thereto) shall be considered without
regard to any qualification based on materiality or "material adverse effect"
set forth therein.

  

### 

  

### (c) The amount to which a Purchaser-Indemnified Person may become
entitled under this _Article VIII_ shall be net of any actual recovery
(whether by way of payment, discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or
otherwise) received from a third party (including any insurer) less any cost
associated with receiving such recovery in respect of a claim. To the
extent that insurance, "pass-through" warranty coverage from a manufacturer
or other form of recovery or reimbursement from a third party is available to
any Purchaser-Indemnified Person to cover any item for which indemnification
may be sought hereunder, Sellers shall, or shall cause each other Purchaser-
Indemnified Person to, on a timely and expeditious basis, use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect recovery under applicable insurance policies and
warranties, and use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue to conclusion
available remedies or causes of action to recover the amount of its claim as
may be available from such other party; _provided_ that the availability of a
potential recovery against such a third party shall not affect any SellerÂ’s
right to make a claim for indemnity pursuant to this _Section 8.2_. To the
extent of any indemnification with respect to any claim referred to in the
previous sentence, Sellers shall assign, and Sellers shall cause each other
Purchaser-Indemnified Person to assign, to Purchaser, to the fullest extent
allowable, its claim against such insurance, warranty coverage or third-party
claim, or in the event assignment is not permissible, but Sellers or the
other Purchaser-Indemnified Person in question is nonetheless permitted to
pursue such claim on PurchaserÂ’s behalf, Sellers shall pursue, or shall cause
such other Purchaser-Indemnified Person to pursue, such claim, at PurchaserÂ’s
direction and expense and without additional out-of-pocket expense to any
Purchaser-Indemnified Person, with any recovery thereon to be transmitted
promptly to Purchaser upon receipt. To the extent that indemnification has
not been paid on account of any such claim, any Purchaser-Indemnified Person
may pursue recovery against such insurance warranty coverage or third party
and shall be entitled to retain all recoveries made as a result of any
such action. In addition, the amount to which the Purchaser-Indemnified
Persons may become entitled under this _Article VIII_ shall be net of any
Tax benefits theretofore realized by Sellers and their Affiliates in respect
of Damages to be indemnified hereunder, and as and when a Seller or any of
its Affiliates realizes any Tax benefits in respect of Damages theretofore
indemnified hereunder, Sellers shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to the
amount of such Tax benefit so realized.  Sellers shall furnish Purchaser with
such information respecting the assets, business and financial records of
Sellers relating to any such claims as Purchaser may, from time to time,
reasonably request and at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each Purchaser-Indemnified Person shall be responsible for taking or
causing to be taken reasonable steps to mitigate its Damages upon and after
becoming aware of any event that

  



        
   

  



  

could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be
indemnifiable under this _Article VIII_.

  

### 

  

 **SECTION 8.3.** ** Notice of Claim**.

  



  

### (a) As used herein, the term " _Claim_ " means a claim for
indemnification by any Seller-Indemnified Person or any Purchaser-Indemnified
Person, as the case may be, for Damages under this _Article VIII_ (such
Person making a Claim, an " _Indemnitee_ "). An Indemnitee shall give notice
of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages
incurred by any other Seller-Indemnified Person or Purchaser-Indemnified
Person, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of such Claim executed by
an officer of Purchaser or Parent, as applicable (a " _Notice of Claim_ "),
and delivered to Parent or Purchaser, as applicable (such receiving party,
the " _Indemnitor_ "), promptly after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the
existence of any potential claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ (but in any event not later than the Survival Date, in
the case of a Claim relating to a Limited-Liability Item) arising out of or
resulting from: (i) any item subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms
of _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_; or (ii) the assertion, whether orally or
in writing, against any Indemnitee of a claim, demand, suit, action,
arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party
against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that
arises out of or results from any item subject to indemnification pursuant to
the terms of _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ ; _provided_ that no failure or
delay in the giving of such notice (so long as such notice is given not later
than the Survival Date, in the case of a Claim relating to a Limited-
Liability Item) shall adversely affect the IndemniteeÂ’s rights with respect
to such claim, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnitee shall contain the following
information:

  

### 

  

#### (i) that Indemnitee has incurred or paid or, in good faith, believes it
shall have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated amount (where
practicable) arising from such Claim (which amount may be the amount of
damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against any Indemnitee
based on alleged facts, that if true, would give rise to liability for
Damages to such Indemnitee under this  _Article VIII_); and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Indemnitee), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise
to the alleged Damages based on IndemniteeÂ’s good faith belief thereof,
including the identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent
reasonably available to Indemnitee). Following delivery of the Notice of
Claim (or at the same time if the Indemnitee so elects) the Indemnitee shall
deliver copies of any demand or complaint, the amount of Damages, the date
each such item was incurred or paid, or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is
related.

  

#### 

  

 **SECTION 8.4.** ** Defense of Third-Party Claims**.

  



  

### (a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to defend any Third-Party Claim, and
the costs and expenses incurred by

  



        
   

  



  

the Indemnitor in connection with such defense by the Indemnitor (including
attorneysÂ’ fees, other professionalsÂ’ and expertsÂ’ fees and court or
arbitration costs) shall be paid by the Indemnitor; _provided_ that Sellers
shall be deemed to have elected to defend the High Point Litigation. If the
Indemnitor so elects, then the Indemnitee may participate, through counsel of
its own choice and at its own expense, in the defense of such Third-
Party Claim.

  

### 

  

### (b) Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim
to the Indemnitor; _provided_  that (so long as such notice is given on or
prior to the Survival Date, in the case of a Claim relating to a Limited-
Indemnity Item) the failure timely to give such notice shall not limit or
reduce the IndemniteeÂ’s right to indemnity hereunder unless (and then only to
the extent that) the Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitor shall
be entitled to assume the defense thereof utilizing legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall
not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnitee if the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation.

  

### 

  

### (c) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall, at the IndemniteeÂ’s request, permit
the Indemnitee and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense
thereof. Purchaser and Sellers shall make available to each other and each
otherÂ’s counsel and accountants, without charge, all of its or their books
and records relating to the Third-Party Claim, and each party will render to
the other party such assistance as may be reasonably required in order to
insure the proper and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested by the other party in connection therewith.

  

### 

  

### (d) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the right to enter into any
settlement of a Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee;
_provided_ that (i) such settlement does not involve any injunctive or other
equitable relief binding upon the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, and
(ii) such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee
from all liability with respect to such claim, without prejudice, other than
the obligation to pay any amount that the Indemnitor pays or causes to be
paid.

  

### 

  

 **SECTION 8.5.** ** Resolution of Notice of Claim**.

  



  

Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnitee shall be resolved as follows:

  



  

### (a) _Admitted Claims_. If, within 20 Business Days after a Notice of
Claim is delivered to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor agrees in writing that
liability for such Claim is indemnified under _Section 8.1_ or _Section
8.2_, as applicable, the full amount of the Damages specified in the Notice
of Claim is agreed to, and that such Notice of Claim is timely, the
Indemnitor shall be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by
the Indemnitee of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim
in accordance with this _Article VIII_.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) _Contested Claims_. If the Indemnitor does not agree in writing to
such Notice of Claim or gives the other party written notice contesting all
or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a " _Contested Claim_ ") within the 20
Business Day period specified in _Section 8.5(a)_, then such Contested Claim
shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed by
Purchaser and Sellers or (ii) in the absence of such a written settlement
agreement within 45 days of such notice or such longer period as is mutually
agreed upon by the parties, by binding arbitration between Purchaser and
Sellers in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 8.5_.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Arbitration of Contested Claims_. Any Contested Claim that is not
settled by the parties as set forth in _Section 8.5(b) _shall be submitted
to mandatory, final and binding arbitration before J.A.M.S./ENDISPUTE or its
successor (" _J.A.M.S._ ") pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C., Section 1 et seq., and that any such arbitration shall be conducted
in Delaware.  If J.A.M.S. ceases to provide arbitration service, then the
term " _J.A.M.S._ " shall thereafter mean and refer to the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). Either Purchaser or Parent may commence
the arbitration process called for by this Agreement by filing a written
demand for arbitration with J.A.M.S. and giving a copy of such demand to each
of the other party to this Agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of J.A.M.SÂ’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration (or,
if J.A.M.S. then means the AAA, the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA
then in effect), subject to the provisions of this _Section 8.5(c)_.
The parties shall cooperate with J.A.M.S. and with each other in promptly
selecting an arbitrator from J.A.M.S.Â’ panel of neutrals and in scheduling
the arbitration proceedings in order to fulfill the provisions, purposes and
intent of this Agreement. The parties covenant that they shall participate
in the arbitration in good faith and that they shall share in its costs in
accordance with this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 8.5(c)_
may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party
seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and
expenses, including attorneysÂ’ fees, to be paid by the party against whom
enforcement is ordered. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator
may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Payment of Costs_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand, shall each bear one-half of the expense of deposits and advances
required by the arbitrator, but any party may advance such amounts, subject
to recovery as an addition or offset to any award. For the avoidance of doubt,
the monetary recovery owed to the prevailing party or parties to the
arbitration proceeding shall include reimbursement of such advances.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Burden of Proof_. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided
herein, for any Contested Claim submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof
shall be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding
governed exclusively by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts executed and entered into within the State of Delaware, without
regard to the principles of choice of law or conflicts of law of any
jurisdiction.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Award_. Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings
hereunder, the arbitrator shall render findings of fact and conclusions of
law and a final written arbitration award setting forth the basis and reasons
for any decision reached (the " _Final Award_ ") and shall deliver such
documents to Sellers and Purchaser, together with a signed copy of the Final
Award. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Final Award shall
constitute a conclusive determination of

  



        
   

  



  

all issues in question, binding upon Sellers and Purchaser, and shall include
an affirmative statement to such effect.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Timing_. Sellers, Purchaser and the arbitrator shall conclude each
arbitration pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ as promptly as possible for the
Contested Claim being arbitrated.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Terms of Arbitration_. The arbitrator chosen in accordance with
these provisions shall not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect
the terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, except as specifically
otherwise provided in this Agreement, arbitration conducted in accordance
with this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for
any Contested Claim made pursuant to this _Article VIII_;  _provided_ that
this sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of its right to seek
specific performance or injunctive relief in the case of another partyÂ’s
failure to comply with the covenants made by such other party.

  

### 

  

 **SECTION 8.6.** ** Survival of Covenants, Representations and
Warranties**.

  



  

All representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement, as
qualified by the Schedules hereto as updated from time to time in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, shall remain operative and in full force
and effect until that date that is the earlier of (i) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, and (ii) the Survival Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing occurs and a claim or proceeding
with respect to breach of any such representation or warranty has been
instituted prior to the Survival Date, such representation or warranty shall
survive for purposes of such claim until there has been a final determination
with respect to such claim or proceeding. All representations and warranties
of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full
force and effect until that date that is the earlier of (i) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ and (ii) the Survival
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing occurs and a claim or
proceeding with respect to breach of any such representation or warranty has
been instituted prior to the Survival Date, such representation or warranty
shall survive for purposes of such claim until there has been a
final determination with respect to such claim or proceeding. All covenants
of the parties shall survive according to their respective terms.

  



  

 **SECTION 8.7.** ** ****Exclusive Remedy; Non-Recourse**.

  



  

### (a) After the Closing, the indemnification rights set forth in this
_Article VIII_ are and shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
Purchaser, the other Seller-Indemnified Persons, Sellers and the other

Transactions contemplated hereby.

### (b) Purchaser, for itself, its successors and assigns including the other

the transactions contemplated hereby are non-recourse as to any Seller or any
other Purchaser-Indemnified Person and that they shall have no recourse
against any Seller or any other

  

### 

  

### 48   

     
   

  

### 

  

Purchaser-Indemnified Person for or on account of any matter, cause, claim or
thing of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, other than as
expressly provided in this _Article VIII_.

  

### 

  

### (c) In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser for itself, its successors
and assigns, and the other Seller-Indemnified Persons, covenant and agree
that neither Purchaser nor any other Seller-Indemnified Person shall sue or
initiate or maintain any action, suit or cause of action against any Seller
or any other Purchaser-Indemnified Person as a result of this Agreement or
the Transactions, except as expressly provided hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 8.7_ shall not be
deemed a waiver by any party of its right to seek specific performance or
injunctive relief in the case of another partyÂ’s failure to comply with the
covenants made by such other party to be performed after the Closing, or any
remedy of any party in respect of any fraud committed by any other party.
 In addition, the parties agree that the limitations set forth in this
_Article VIII_ shall not apply to any fraud or willful breach of any
covenant committed by any party.

  

### 

  

### (e) The provisions of _Article VIII_ were specifically bargained for
and reflected in the amounts payable to Sellers in connection with the
Transactions pursuant to _Section 1.3_.

decree, permanent injunction, judgment, order or other action or to have any
of the foregoing vacated or made inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and has complied with its obligations under
_Section 6.3_;

  

### 

  

### (e) by Sellers or Purchaser if the Transactions shall not have been
consummated on or before July 14, 2008 (the " _Termination Date_ ");

### (a) If this Agreement is terminated under _Section 9.1(a)_, _Section
9.1(d)_ or  _Section 9.1(e)_ at a time when no party is in

agreement then all further liabilities and obligations of Sellers to

### 

  

### (h) " _Closing Working Capital_ " means the aggregate amount of the
current assets of Companies (excluding Closing Cash and excluding deferred
tax benefits) less the aggregate amount of the current liabilities of the
Companies (exclusive of deferred rent obligations, deferred tax liabilities
and all amounts payable in respect of the Bank Facility), in each case
determined as of the Adjustment Time after giving effect to the Transactions
(but without giving effect to any action by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, including the Companies, after the Closing) and in
accordance with _Section 1.5(e)_ ; provided that, if Purchaser has
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.8_ prior
to the Closing and does not do so, then the aggregate amount of Limited
6.8 Liabilities that will be included as current liabilities for purposes
of computing of the Closing Working Capital shall not be greater than _the
sum of_ (x) the amount (if any) by which the Closing Working Capital
(determined without taking into account any Limited 6.8 Liabilities) exceeds

$12,000,000 exceeds the aggregate amount (if any) of Damages with respect
to Limited-Indemnity Items for which the Seller-Indemnified Persons have been
indemnified pursuant to _Section 8.1_ prior to the date upon which the
Final Purchase Price is determined. _For example,_ if the amount of the
Closing Working Capital (determined without taking into account any Limited
6.8 Liabilities) were negative $5,500,000 and the aggregate amount of Damages
with respect to Limited-Indemnity Items for which the Seller-Indemnified
Persons are indemnified pursuant to _Section 8.1_ prior to the date upon
which the Final Purchase Price is determined were $1,000,000, then the
amounts described in clauses (x) and (y) above would be $3,000,000
and $11,000,000, respectively, and the maximum aggregate amount of Limited
6.8 Liabilities that could be included as current liabilities for purposes
of computing of the Closing Working Capital would be $14,000,000. The amount
of the Closing Working Capital will be determined in light of the facts and
circumstances existing as of the Closing Date and (except as provided in the
preceding proviso with respect to indemnified liabilities) without reference
to events or circumstances occurring or arising after the Closing Date.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing Closing Working Capital shall not include (i)
any liability in respect of any amount alleged in the High Point Litigation
to be payable by the Companies, except to the extent of any amount payable by
the Companies as of the Adjustment Time pursuant to the terms of any judgment
that as of the Adjustment Time has become final and is not then subject to
any appeal that is pending or that may be made, or any written settlement
agreement entered into by any of the Companies (in either case, a " _Final
Judgment_ "); or (ii) any amount alleged in the Kingstowne Litigation to be
payable to any Company, except to the extent of any amount payable to any
Company as of the Adjustment Time pursuant to the terms of any Final
Judgment.
