iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 7, 2011 (this
"Agreement"), is by and among Newport Corporation, a Nevada corporation

Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Ophir Optronics Ltd., an Israeli
company (the "Company"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and
in accordance with Sections 314-327 of the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999
(the "Israeli Companies Law"), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to
effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
pursuant to which Merger Sub shall cease to exist, the Company shall become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and the Company Ordinary Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors and
shareholders of Merger Sub have each approved this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously approved and
declared advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, on the

recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote "For" approval of this
Agreement and the Merger at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, and the applicable provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, at
the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in
accordance with Section 323 of the Israeli Companies Law, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall
be the company surviving the Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (the "Surviving Corporation").

SECTION 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than the fifth
business day) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at  such time), at the offices of Gross, Kleinhendler, Hodak, Halevy, Greenberg
and Co., One Azrieli Center, Tel Aviv, Israel, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date of the Closing
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

SECTION 1.3.  _Effective Time_. Immediately following the Closing, Merger Sub
and the Company shall deliver to the Registrar of Companies of the State of
Israel (the "Companies Registrar") a notice informing the Companies Registrar
of the Merger and requesting the Companies Registrar to issue a certificate
evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with Section 323(5) of
the Israeli Companies Law (the "Certificate of Merger"). The parties hereto
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Certificate of
Merger on, or as soon as possible after, the Closing Date. The Merger shall
become effective upon the issuance and delivery by the Companies Registrar of
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law. The
time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as
the "Effective Time."

SECTION 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the Israeli Companies Law and this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, (a)
all properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, (b) all debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving
Corporation and (c) all properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Surviving Corporation shall continue unaffected by the
Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law.

SECTION 1.5. _Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation_. The
articles of association of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the articles of association of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law. 

SECTION 1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each member of the respective Boards
of Directors (or equivalent governing bodies) of the Company and (to the
extent entitled to be appointed or removed by the Company) its Subsidiaries
shall resign or be removed and replaced with successors selected by Parent.
Each of the parties hereto shall take all reasonable action necessary to cause
the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed or their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
association of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The parties hereto shall take all reasonable actions necessary so that
from and after the Effective Time, the individuals designated by Parent not
later than five days prior to the Closing Date shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly appointed
or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles
of association of the Surviving Corporation.

 



2 SECTION 1.7. _Approval Procedures_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Merger and the other Transactions will be consummated in accordance with
Section 314 through Section 327 of the Israeli Companies Law.

ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of Constituent Corporations; Exchange
of_

_Certificates; Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Company Warrants _

SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of ordinary
shares, par value NIS 1 per share, of the Company ("Company Ordinary Shares")
or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary share of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the shares of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of ordinary shares of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Company Ordinary Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company Ordinary
Share shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent $8.43 in cash
per Company Ordinary Share without interest (the amount payable to a holder
of Company Ordinary Shares as a result of the Merger, the "Merger
Consideration," which shall be subject to withholding for Taxes as provided in
_Section 2.2(g)_). As of the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Ordinary Shares (each, a "Certificate"), and each beneficial owner of any
Book-Entry Company Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Certificate or the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented thereby
or to such Book-Entry Company Shares, as applicable, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_.
Subject to the penultimate sentence of _Section 2.2(e)_, if, at any time
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

SECTION 2.2. _Surrender and Payment Procedures_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
Israeli based bank or trust company to act as paying agent for the holders of
Company Ordinary Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent").
The Paying Agent shall receive, and hold in trust for the benefit of holders
of Company Ordinary Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of Company Ordinary Shares are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_.
Parent shall deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent
not later than one business day following the Effective Time. Pending its
disbursement to such holders, the Paying Agent shall invest the Merger
Consideration deposited with it as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that, (i) no such

 



3  investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article II_, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities
that could prevent or delay payments to be made to the former Company
shareholders pursuant to this _Article II_, and (iii) such investments shall
be in (A) short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or (B) a AAA-rated money-market fund. Any net profit resulting from,
or interest or income produced by, the Merger Consideration deposited with
the Paying Agent shall be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.

(b) _Paying Agent Payment Procedures_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall instruct the Paying Agent to, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but
not later than the second business day) after the Effective Time:

 

(i) release to the Companys registration company (the "Registration
Company"), for the benefit of the beneficial owners of Company Ordinary
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are registered
in the name of the Registration Company for the benefit of TASE members ("Book
Entry Company Shares"), cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Merger Consideration payable per Company Ordinary Share, _multiplied_ by (B)
the number of Book Entry Company Shares (the product of (A) and (B), the
"Book-Entry Fund"). The Registration Company shall promptly deliver the Book-
Entry Fund to the TASE clearinghouse, which shall deliver the respective and
appropriate portion of the Book-Entry Fund to each of the beneficial owners of
Book Entry Company Shares in accordance with applicable customary stock
surrender and payment procedures and regulations of TASE; and

(ii) mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, excluding any
Certificate representing Company Ordinary Shares held of record by the
Registration Company, (i) a letter which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery to the Paying Agent of the Certificates and any properly
completed and validly executed documents reasonably required by the Paying
Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration for the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented thereby.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such properly completed and validly executed documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the surrendered Certificate shall
forthwith be cancelled in the Companys books and the surrendering holder
shall be promptly paid the Merger Consideration for the Company Ordinary
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered or whose name appears on the
records of a nominee company ( _Chevra Le Rishumim_) in accordance with such
properly completed and validly executed documents, such payment shall be
conditioned upon (A) the Certificate surrendered being properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and (B) the Person requesting such payment (x) having paid any transfer
and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
(y) having established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Notwithstanding the

 



4  surrender and payment procedure described in this _Section 2.2_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for the Company Ordinary
Shares formerly represented thereby as contemplated by this _Article II_, and
any other rights in connection with each such Certificate shall be null and
void.

 

(c) _Transfer Books_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of Company
Ordinary Shares (whether in the form of Book Entry Company Shares or
represented by a Certificate) pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Ordinary Shares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
and shareholder register of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books or
shareholder register of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Paying Agent shall pay the
applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for any Company Ordinary Shares
formerly represented by a purportedly lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
subject to the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed delivering an affidavit of loss, which affidavit may include at
the Surviving Corporations discretion, an indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate. Any reference made in this Agreement to a "Certificate" shall
include an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof that complies with the foregoing
requirements.

(e) _Termination of Payment Funds_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation may require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including the proceeds of any
investments with respect thereto) deposited with the Paying Agent which have
not been disbursed to the former holders of Company Ordinary Shares, and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Registration Company to
return any portion of the Book-Entry Fund not distributed to the beneficial
owners of the Book Entry Company Shares, and thereafter such former holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable with respect to Company Ordinary Shares. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such former shareholders at the time such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing (or the Merger does not
become effective) for any reason and any cash has been transmitted to the
Paying Agent or the Registration Company prior to termination, such cash
together with any interest or other earnings thereon shall promptly be
returned to Parent.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, nor the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly delivered
to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 



5 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Registration
Company, the TASE members, the Paying Agent and the Option Trustees shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any former holder of Company Ordinary Shares, Company Warrants, Options
and/or Stock Appreciation Rights (as the case may be) pursuant to this
Agreement, any amounts required to be deducted and withheld from such payments
under the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance [New Version], 1961, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Ordinance"), or under
any other applicable state, local, domestic or foreign Law, including, without
limitation, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the withholding Taxes deduction in Israel shall be at the
highest applicable tax rate, unless otherwise indicated to the TASE member,
the Surviving Corporation, the Registration Company, the Paying Agent or the
Option Trustees, as applicable, in a certificate or other written approval
from the ITA which provides a withholding exemption or a reduced Tax rate,
in which case the deduction and withholding of any amounts under the
Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli law or requirement, if any, from
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to such holder of record of Company
Ordinary Shares shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such
approval. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (such as, by a TASE member, the Registration Company, the Paying
Agent or the Option Trustees), Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Company Ordinary Shares, Company Warrants, Options and/or Stock
Appreciation Rights (as the case may be) and paid an appropriate amount to
such Governmental Authority. Any amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid directly to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Parent may apply in its sole discretion to the ITA to
seek a pre-ruling for the method of deduction and applicable Tax rules. In no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay interest on
any amounts payable to holders of Company Ordinary Shares, Company Warrants,
Options or Stock Appreciation Rights so long as Parent timely complies with
its obligations under _Sections 2.2(a)_ and _2.3(d)_.

SECTION 2.3. _Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Company Warrants_.

(a) _Options and Stock Appreciation Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each option to
acquire Company Ordinary Shares (each, an "Option") and each Stock
Appreciation Right issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (i) with an exercise price or base value, as applicable, less than the
Merger Consideration payable per Company Ordinary Share (such Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights, "In the Money Options") and that are vested
and exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled, terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive only the Option Consideration for each Company Ordinary Share then
subject to such In the Money Options, as the case may be, and (ii) with an
exercise price or base value, as applicable, equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration payable per Company Ordinary Share (whether or not vested
and exercisable as of the Effective Time) automatically shall be cancelled
and terminated at the Effective Time without any

 



6  payment or further rights or claims of the holder thereof. All Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights that are not exercised prior to the Effective Time
or cancelled as provided for in _clause (i) _or _(ii)_ above (each, a
"Continuing Option") shall be deemed assumed as of the Effective Time by the
Surviving Corporation, shall have, subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 2.3(a)_, the same exercise price or base value, as applicable, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue to vest in
accordance with the existing vesting schedule of such Continuing Options, but
upon exercise, the holders of such Continuing Options will be entitled only
to receive the same aggregate Merger Consideration they would have received
pursuant to the Merger had such Continuing Options been exercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In each case, the Option Consideration each
holder of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights is entitled to receive for
such Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be rounded to the nearest
cent and computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable for all Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights held by such holder. Upon the Effective Time,
all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (other than Continuing Options)
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and
each holder of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right (other than Continuing
Options) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights to receive any cash payments, as expressly set forth herein. For
purposes of the foregoing, the applicable exercise price of each Option and
the base value of each Stock Appreciation Right (including in both cases, any
Continuing Options deemed assumed by the Surviving Corporation) shall be
calculated in U.S. Dollars in accordance with the representative rate of
the U.S. Dollar in NIS, as published by the Bank of Israel on the third
business day prior to the Closing Date and the linkage to the consumer price
index shall cease as of such date.

 

(b) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the holders of Company Warrants, each unexpired and unexercised
Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled, terminated and converted into the right to receive (upon surrender
of such Company Warrants for cancellation) only an amount of cash (the
"Warrant Consideration") equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of Company Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of such
Company Warrant, _less_ (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such Company
Warrant. The Warrant Consideration each holder of Company Warrants is entitled
to receive for such holders Company Warrants shall be rounded to the nearest
cent and computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable in the Merger for
all Company Warrants held by such holder. Upon the Effective Time, all Company
Warrants shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Warrant shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Warrant Consideration
upon the surrender thereof as set forth herein.

 

(c) _Payment Timing_. Subject to the first sentence of _Section 2.3(e)_,
Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the
Option Trustees, as applicable, to pay the Option Consideration and the
Warrant Consideration at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but, subject in the case of Company Warrants to the surrender
thereof prior to payment).

(d) _Option Consideration_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the second business day
thereafter, Parent shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the account
designated by the applicable Option

 



7  Trustee, in cooperation with any plan administrator under the applicable
stock option or stock appreciation rights plan of the Company, the aggregate
Option Consideration that holders of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights
(including vested and unvested In the Money Options that are Company 102
Securities) are entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_; _provided_
, that in lieu of making such deposit, Parent may elect to pay such Option
Consideration directly to such holders through the Surviving Corporations or
its applicable Subsidiaries ordinary payroll mechanisms or through some other
payment procedure, unless such payment mechanism will result in the loss of a
Tax benefit otherwise available to the applicable Option or Stock Appreciation
Right holder or is prohibited by the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan or applicable Law. As soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (and
except to the extent Parent elects to make such payments directly as
contemplated by the preceding provision), the Option Trustee, in coordination
with the applicable plan administrator, shall pay to each holder of Options or
Stock Appreciation Rights (other than holders of Company 102 Securities) the
amounts contemplated by _Section 2.3(a)_, without interest and _less_
applicable deductions and withholding for Tax. All payments with respect to
Company 102 Securities, as set forth on _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the "Option Schedule"), shall be delivered, or caused to
be delivered, by Parent to the 102 Trustee, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but not later than the second business day
thereafter), to be held and distributed pursuant to the agreement with the 102
Trustee, the terms of the respective Company Stock Plan governing the
applicable Option or Stock Appreciation Right and applicable Laws (including
the provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder). The 102 Trustee shall comply with any applicable
Israeli Tax withholding requirements with respect to payments in respect of
Company 102 Securities and with any procedures required by the Options Tax
Ruling, if obtained. Any amounts deposited with the 102 Trustee that are not
needed for payment to holders of Options or Stock Appreciation Right or for
Taxes shall be returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(e) _Company Stock Plans and Company Warrants_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all actions and make any amendments to the terms of the
Company Stock Plans, Company Warrants and related award agreements, to the
extent the Company determines it is required to effect the treatment
provided in this _Section 2.3_, and obtain any consents from holders of
Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Company Warrants that are necessary to
give effect to this _Section 2.3_ without any liability of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation (other than the obligations to pay the Option
Consideration and Warrant Consideration when required pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
thereof will at the Effective Time (nor will the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time) be bound by any options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock units, phantom equity awards, warrants
or other rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than
Parent and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, to own or acquire any share capital
of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (other than share capital of
Optical Metrology Ltd., Ophir Optronics GmbH and Ophir Japan Ltd. held by
other shareholders thereof as of the date hereof as reflected on _Section
3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or (except with respect to the
payments upon exercise of Continuing Options as described above) to receive
any payment in respect thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to terminate all Company Warrants and all Company
Stock Plans, other than those under which Continuing Options were granted
(and only to the limited extent necessary for the

 



8  treatment of Continuing Options provided in _Section 2.3(a)_), such
termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 2.4. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
II_ to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
_Section 5.2_ hereof and subject to the exception permitting the issuance of
additional Options or Stock Appreciation Rights set forth in the proviso to
_Section 5.2(a)(i)_, which shall have no effect on the Merger
Consideration), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the number of outstanding Company Ordinary Shares or securities or other
rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Ordinary
Shares shall increase or be changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of the issuance or grant of additional Company
Ordinary Shares, Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Company Warrants or other
securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
Company Ordinary Shares or the occurrence or record date of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split (including a
reverse stock split), combination, exchange of shares or other transaction
(but excluding any issuance of Company Ordinary Shares upon exercise of
Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or Company Warrants outstanding and
disclosed to Parent as of the date of this Agreement), the Merger
Consideration payable per Company Ordinary Share and any other dependent
items shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such issuance, grant, stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split (including a
reverse stock split), combination, exchange of shares or other transaction.

SECTION 2.5. _Payment Currency_. All payments of Merger Consideration,
Option Consideration and Warrant Consideration shall be made in United States
Dollars, and any right to receive Merger Consideration shall only entitle the
holder of such right to receive the applicable consideration in United States
Dollars. Each recipient of Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and
Warrant Consideration shall be responsible for making appropriate arrangements
to receive such payments in the form of United States Dollars, and, to the
extent applicable, any expense incurred as a result of receiving, converting
or exchanging such United States Dollar denominated payments into New Israeli
Shekels or any other currency, shall be borne solely by the Person entitled to
such payment.

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as
expressly set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered by the Company to
Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") (it being understood that any information disclosed in a
specific section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated into any other section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Schedule where the relevance of such disclosed
information is self-explanatory and it is readily apparent that such
disclosure applies to the Companys representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement):

 



9 SECTION 3.1. _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
organization duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the
extent such status is recognized in such jurisdictions) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and has
all requisite power and authority necessary to own, lease and operate all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as conducted. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased makes such licensing or qualification necessary.

(b)  _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
Subsidiaries of the Company together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of each such Subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable
and, except as set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. All such shares
that are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries are owned free and clear of
all Liens. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any obligation
(contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire any
capital stock or other ownership interest of the Company or any Subsidiary or
any convertible securities or rights, warrants or options of the type
described in the preceding sentence. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of
the Company is party to any agreement restricting the voting or transfer of
any capital stock or other ownership interest of the Company or any
Subsidiary. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, voting securities or equity or other ownership
interests in any Person.

memorandum of association and articles of association (the "Company Charter
Documents") and correct and complete copies of the memorandum of association,
articles of association, certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational and governing documents) of each of its

extent not a Filed Company ISA Document. All such Company Charter Documents
and Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of their respective
provisions. The Company has made available to Parent and its representatives
correct and complete copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that
have not yet been finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of shareholders,
the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2008.

SECTION 3.2. _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company is NIS 35,000,000 divided into
35,000,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of NIS 1 per share, of which as

outstanding and (ii) 3,215,468 Company

 



10  Ordinary Shares are subject to outstanding Options, Stock Appreciation
Rights and Company Warrants granted under the Company Stock Plans. Since July

issued and outstanding or subject to outstanding Options, Stock Appreciation
Rights or Company Warrants as of such date, other than as a result of Company
Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of such outstanding Options, Stock
Appreciation Rights or Company Warrants. The Company holds no Company Ordinary
Shares as treasury shares and no Subsidiary of the Company owns any Company
Ordinary Shares. All outstanding Company Ordinary Shares have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free
of preemptive rights. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a correct and complete list of all outstanding Options, Stock
Appreciation Rights, Company Warrants or other rights to purchase or receive
Company Ordinary Shares (or other equity interests) granted under the Company
Stock Plans or otherwise, and, for each such Option, Stock Appreciation Right,
Company Warrant or other right, to the extent applicable, the number of
Company Ordinary Shares subject thereto, the terms of vesting, the Company
Stock Plan pursuant to which it was granted, the grant and expiration dates,
the exercise price or base value thereof (and applicable currency), the name
of the holder thereof, and whether the vesting of such Option, Stock
Appreciation Right or Company Warrant shall be subject to acceleration in
connection with the Merger, and with respect to the Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights granted to Israeli taxpayers, whether each such
Option or Stock Appreciation Right was granted pursuant to Section 3(i) of the
Ordinance, Section 102 of the Ordinance (prior to January 1, 2003) or Section
102 of the Ordinance (on or after January 1, 2003) and the applicable
subsection of Section 102 pursuant to which the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right was granted. Since December 31, 2010, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has issued any shares of capital stock, voting securities or
equity interests, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests, other than the grant of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights in
the ordinary course of business prior to the date hereof and the issuance of
Company Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights referred to above in this _Section 3.2(a)_.

(b) _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of the authorized and outstanding share capital or
capital stock of each respective Subsidiary of the Company, the number and
percentage of the outstanding share capital or capital stock held by the
Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the name, number and percentage
of the outstanding share capital or capital stock held by each shareholder
thereof other than the Company. Except as set forth on _Section 3.2(a)_ and
_Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are not and as of
the Effective Time there shall not be, any share capital, shares of capital
stock, voting securities or equity or other ownership interests of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries issued and outstanding or any subscriptions,
options, restricted stock units, phantom equity awards, warrants, calls,
convertible or exchangeable securities, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character providing for the issuance or disposition of any share
capital, shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity or other
ownership interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any
rights or instruments representing the right to purchase, acquire or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any other securities convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for or
evidencing the rights to subscribe for any such capital stock.

 



11 SECTION 3.3. _Authority; Noncontravention; Voting Requirements_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject only to obtaining the Company Shareholder

obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger by the
Company. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the "Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception").

the Company and its shareholders this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Merger, (ii) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of
the Company vote to adopt this Agreement and (iii) made all other affirmative
determinations required to be made by the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger under the Israeli Companies Law and any other
applicable Laws. 

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the Merger or the other Transactions, nor
compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder would (i) conflict
with or violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents or any of the
Subsidiary Documents or (ii) assuming that the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Required Regulatory Consents, and the Other Approvals are obtained, made
or given (in the case of filing or notice only requirements) and any waiting
periods thereunder have terminated or expired, (x) violate any Law, or any
Order of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (y) violate,

termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by,
trigger any payment or penalty under, or give rise to any obligation to
purchase, sell or issue (or offer to purchase, sell or issue) any shares of
capital stock or other ownership interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Company Charter
Document or any of the Subsidiary Documents or under any loan or credit
agreement, debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
license, lease, contract, arrangement or other agreement, instrument or
obligation (each, a "Contract") or any Permit to which the Company 

 



12  or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets is bound.

(d) Under the Israeli Companies Law, and assuming the accuracy of Parents
representation in _Section 4.2(c)_ hereof, the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Company Ordinary Shares present and voting at the Company Shareholder
Meeting (not including abstentions) (the "Company Shareholder Approval"), is
the only vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of share
capital of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which is necessary to adopt
this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

SECTION 3.4. _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (i) the Required Regulatory
Consents, (ii) the filing of the Merger Notice with the Companies Registrar
and the issuance of the Certificate of Merger by the Companies Registrar, and
(iii) the Other Approvals, no consents or approvals of, or notices to or
filings, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are
necessary for the execution, delivery and performance of the Companys
obligations under this Agreement, including consummation of the Merger.

SECTION 3.5. _Company Israeli Documents; Internal Controls; Financial
Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

(a) The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents required to be filed with the Israeli Securities Authority
(the "ISA") pursuant to the reporting requirements of the Securities Law of
1968 and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Company Israeli
Documents"). As of their respective effective dates, the Company Israeli

Israeli Securities Law of 1968 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder ("Israeli Securities Law"), and contained all material facts
required to be included therein and did not include any misleading fact.

(b) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with (i) all
applicable listing and corporate governance rules, regulations and
requirements of TASE and (ii) the corporate governance and other requirements
of the Israeli Companies Law.

 

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) all transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit timely preparation of accurate financial
statements in conformity with IFRS and to maintain asset accountability and
(ii) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing
assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any material differences. As of December 31, 2010, the internal control of
financial reporting and disclosure of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is effective, and there are no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses therein.

(d) The Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of any
internal controls which could adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Companys 

 



13  auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls, and in the case of (i)
and (ii), there being none. The Company has made available to Parent (x) a
summary of all such disclosures or confirmation of the absence of the matters
described in (i) and (ii) made by the Companys principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to the Companys auditors and audit
committee and (y) any material communication made by management or the
Companys auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by
applicable listing standards, professional accounting standards or applicable
Laws. No material complaints from any source (whether internal or external)
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and
no material concerns from the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries employees
regarding questionable accounting, auditing or ethical or legal matters, have
been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(e) With respect to the following financial statements (the "Financial
Statements"):

 

(i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010 (December 31, 2010 being the
"Balance Sheet Date"), and the related audited consolidated statements of
income for the annual periods then ended (the "Audited Financial Statements");
and

 

(ii) the consolidated unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2011 (the "Latest Balance Sheet"), and the
related unaudited consolidated statement of income for the three-month period
then ended (the "Interim Statements").

The Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to Parent correct and
complete copies of the Financial Statements, to the extent not included in the
Filed Company ISA Documents.

 

(f) The Audited Financial Statements, the Interim Statements and any quarterly
consolidated financial statements regularly prepared in the ordinary course
of business and filed by the Company with the Company Israeli Documents
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, present fairly in all material
respects the financial condition as of the date thereof, or, as applicable,
the results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries throughout the
periods covered thereby, in each case determined in accordance with IFRS (or
Israeli generally accepted accounting principles) consistently applied
throughout the periods indicated; _provided_ , that the Latest Balance Sheet
and the Interim Statements and any unaudited quarterly consolidated financial
statements prepared after the date hereof may lack footnote disclosure and
other presentation items (as is customary for unaudited financial
statements), and may not include certain IFRS adjustments normally booked in
conjunction with the year-end audit.

(g) All books, records and accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
complete in all material respects and are maintained in all material respects
in accordance with good business practice and comply in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and Laws.

 



14 (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether liquidated or unliquidated, secured or
unsecured, accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that are required to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
prepared in accordance with IFRS or the notes thereto, except liabilities (i)
as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the Audited Financial
Statements as included in the Company Israeli Documents filed by the Company
with the ISA and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Filed Company ISA Documents") or (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 

SECTION 3.6. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Balance Sheet
Date, there have not been any events, changes, occurrences or state of facts
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since the Balance Sheet
Date the Company and its Subsidiaries have carried on and operated their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. Without limiting the foregoing, since
the Balance Sheet Date there has not occurred any material damage to, or
destruction or loss of, any material asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether or not covered by insurance).

 

SECTION 3.7. _Legal Proceedings_. _Section 3.7_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists each Action currently pending (subject, in the case of
investigations, to the Knowledge of the Company) that involves the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective businesses, properties or
assets or that, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
businesses, properties or assets. There is no Action (subject, in the case of
investigations, to the Knowledge of the Company) pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary or
any of its or their respective businesses, properties or assets, which,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably could be expected to be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Company has not
received, and does not otherwise have Knowledge of, any outstanding Orders
against, involving or binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
their respective businesses, properties or assets) or any officers or
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacities as
such.

SECTION 3.8.  _Compliance With Laws; Permits_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are, and at all times since January 1, 2006 have been, in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective businesses, properties or
assets. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person employed or acting at the
direction or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made or
offered or promised, directly or indirectly, any contribution, gift, bribe,
rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other payment, regardless of
form, whether in money, property or services, to any Person, private or
public, in violation of any Law applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries who is engaged in the
manufacture or export of ITAR-controlled defense articles and services (i) is
registered with the U.S. Department of State under ITAR as a manufacturer and
exporter of ITAR-controlled defense articles and services, and its
registration is in full force and effect; (ii) has no pending Export Controls-
related voluntary self-disclosures with the U.S. Department of State, the U.S.
Department of 

 



15  Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security; (iii) has not received any written notice from any
Governmental Authority that reasonably could indicate that it is under
criminal or civil investigation concerning Export Controls and/or sanctions-
related matters; (iv) has not received any written notice as to non-compliance
with Export Controls which could subject the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their Affiliates to civil or criminal fines, penalties or other measures; and
(v) has implemented an Export Controls compliance program, and periodically
reviews the effectiveness and sufficiency of such program.  _Section 3.8_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all current licenses and pending license
applications, technical assistance agreements and other authorizations
relating to Export Controls, export, re-export or transshipment. Except as
set forth on _Section 3.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, have complied in all material respects
with all applicable Export Controls, including compliance with all license
or authorization provisos, terms and conditions, during the last five years,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable record-keeping,
notification, submission, and reporting requirements under applicable Laws,
including but not limited to the record-keeping requirements under the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations and 22 CFR Parts 122 and 124. All
Products manufactured, tested, developed, distributed or marketed by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are and at all times have
been manufactured, tested, developed, distributed, and marketed in compliance
with all applicable registration, licensing, notification and other material
requirements of all applicable Laws. Except as set forth on _Section 3.8_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
holds all licenses, franchises, permits, certificates, approvals and
authorizations necessary for the conduct of its respective business and
operations and the ownership and operation of its respective properties and
assets (collectively, "Permits"). All such Permits are in full force and
effect and, except as set forth on _Section 3.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, will remain in full force and effect after the Effective Time. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are, and at all times have been, in compliance in
all material respects with the terms of all such Permits. Since January 1,
2006, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice from any Governmental Authority (a) claiming or alleging that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries was not in compliance with all Laws and
Permits applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their
properties or other assets or any of their businesses or operations or (b)
indicating that such Governmental Authority was considering amending,
terminating, revoking, cancelling or not renewing any Permit. The consummation
of the Merger, in and of itself, shall not cause the revocation or
cancellation of any Permit or require notification to or prior approval from
or payment of any amounts to any Governmental Authority.

SECTION 3.9. _Information in Immediate Reports_. The Signing Immediate
Report, the Shareholders Meeting Immediate Report and any other document (or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) required to be mailed to the
shareholders of the Company or filed with or furnished to ISA or TASE
in connection with the Merger shall not, at the time of the Company
Shareholder Meeting and at the time mailed to the Companys shareholders or
filed with or furnished to ISA or TASE, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no representation is made by the Company with respect to any

SECTION 3.10. _Tax Matters_.

Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed, or has

in all jurisdictions, and all such filed Tax Returns are correct and complete
in all material respects. All Taxes (whether or not shown on the applicable
Tax Returns) required to be paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
have been timely and fully paid. No written claim has been made in the past
four years by a Tax authority or other Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not or did not
file Tax Returns that the Company or any such Subsidiary was, is or may be
subject to Tax or required to file Tax Returns in such jurisdiction. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or has had any nexus with any
jurisdiction where it does not file a Tax Return, which nexus would subject it
to Tax in such jurisdiction. 

(b) The most recent financial statements contained in the Filed Company ISA
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portion thereof through the
date of such financial statements, and the Taxes payable by the Company and
its Subsidiaries do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past practice and custom
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No material deficiency with respect to
Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority.

through and including 2005 with respect to Optical Metrology Ltd. All Tax
Returns of all other Subsidiaries have been settled with the applicable
Governmental Authority (or the applicable statute of limitations has expired)
through the respective years set forth in _Section 3.10(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. All assessments for Taxes due with respect to such
completed and settled examinations or any concluded litigation have been fully
paid. The Company has not received notice of any pending or threatened
audits, assessments or other actions for any liability in respect of Taxes of
or relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no matters
under discussion with any Governmental Authority, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, with respect to Taxes that are likely to result in any
additional material liability for Taxes with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(or during the last three years spent) fifty percent or more of their working
time on the business of the Company or any of its

 



21  Subsidiaries, other than persons who worked less than six months
cumulatively for the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) No Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or 430 of
the Code (including but not limited to by reason of being a "multiemployer
plan," within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA or other applicable Laws),
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any current or any contingent liability under Title IV of ERISA (other
than insurance premiums satisfied in due course). None of the Company nor any
of its ERISA Affiliates has ever contributed or been obligated to contribute
to any "employee pension plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA)
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or 430 of the Code
(including but not limited to by reason of being a multiemployer plan).

(c) Correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to
each of the Company Plans have been delivered to Parent by the Company to the
extent applicable: (i) the plan document (or if such Company Plan is not
written, an accurate description of the material terms thereof) and related
trust documents, custodial, or insurance contracts or other funding
arrangements, and all amendments thereto; (ii) the three most recent Forms
5500, annual information returns and all schedules thereto with respect to
Company Plans in which employees of the Companys United States Subsidiaries
are participants; (iii) any annual report, actuarial report, or disclosure
materials submitted to any Governmental Authority or distributed
to participants or beneficiaries in the current or any of the three preceding
calendar years with respect to Company Plans in which employees of the
Companys United States Subsidiaries are participants; (iv) the most recent
IRS determination letter and any advisory opinions or rulings by any
Governmental Authority, compliance statements, closing agreements, or similar
materials specific to such Company Plan, and pending requests relating to any
of the foregoing with respect to Company Plans in which employees of the
Companys United States Subsidiaries are participants; (v) the most recent
summary plan descriptions, summary of material modifications, and other
material communications to current or former employees, consultants, sales
agents, independent contractors, or directors regarding any Company Plan; (vi)
employee manuals and handbooks; (vii) any written policies or procedures used

the Manufacturers Association of Israel.

(d) Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company Plans have been established and maintained in compliance
in all material respects with their terms and with the requirements
prescribed (whether as a matter of substantive law or as necessary to secure
favorable tax treatment) by all applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, any
and all governmental or court Orders, the Ordinance and other Laws. The
Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 or other tax-favored
treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code or other
applicable Laws are so qualified, and any trusts intended to be exempt from
United States federal income taxation or other Tax under the Code or other
applicable Laws are so exempt. No event has occurred with respect to the
operation of the Company Plans and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
circumstance 

 



22  exists that could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption, or the
imposition of any liability, penalty, Lien or Tax under ERISA, the Code, the
Ordinance or any other applicable Laws. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred and no condition exists that could subject the Company or
its Subsidiaries, by reason of their affiliation with any ERISA Affiliate, to
any Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability under by ERISA, the Code, the
Ordinance or other applicable Laws.

(e) The Company has not employed or retained any employees whose employment
would require special licenses, approvals or permits (such as foreign
employees). Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no unwritten Company policies or customs which,
by extension, could entitle employees to benefits in addition to what they
are entitled by Law or Contract. Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(e)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no compensation increments or
components that are wrongly classified (or not accounted for) as such with
respect to applicable Tax Laws and are required to be reclassified as salary
components. The Company has properly implemented and has applied, as of the
commencement date of employment, all terms relating to the terms of its
employees employment in all material respects.

(f) With respect to each Company Plan for which a separate fund of assets is
required to be maintained, full and timely payment has been made or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, reserved in the Financial Statements in
accordance with IFRS of all amounts required of the Company, under the terms
of each such Company Plan or applicable Law (determined without regard to any
waiver of legally applicable funding requirements). The fair market value of
the assets of each Company Plan applicable to the Companys United States
Subsidiaries and for which a separate fund of assets is required to be
maintained under applicable United States Law, as of the end of the most
recently ended plan year of each such Company Plan, equaled or exceeded the
then present value of all benefits liabilities under each such Company Plan.
Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the assets of any Company Plan include any capital stock or other
securities issued by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. To the extent any
contribution or payment by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is not required
under applicable Laws to be made with respect to any Company Plan on or prior
to March 31, 2011, such contribution or payment has been reflected on the
Latest Balance Sheet. All amounts due or accrued for all salary, wages,
bonuses, commissions, vacation and sick days have been remitted and paid in a
timely fashion (or timely reserved for) in accordance with all applicable
Laws and the terms of any applicable Company Plan, and no taxes, penalties or
fees are owing under or in respect of any Company Plan other than in the
ordinary course. The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely paid all
outstanding material liabilities, fees, expenses and obligations due and
payable with respect to any Company Plan to its employees, consultants,
independent contractors, agents, directors, officers and any other Person who
provides or has provided services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any Company Plan.

(g) With respect to each Company Plan and fiduciary or service provider
thereof: (i) no Action by or before the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the United States Department of Labor, or any
other Governmental Authority is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened and (ii) no other Action is pending, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, by any participant or beneficiary of any Company

 



23  Plan, other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts that could form a reasonable
basis for any material Action with respect to any Company Plan and fiduciary
or service provider thereof. All amounts that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is legally or contractually required, pursuant to Israeli Law,
(A) to deduct from former or current employees salaries, (B) to transfer to
former or current employees pension arrangements, provident funds and
Insurances, (C) to withhold from former or current employees salaries and
benefits and (D) to pay to any Governmental Authority as required by the
Ordinance, the National Insurance Law and the National Health Insurance Law of
Israel or otherwise, have, in each case, been duly and timely deducted,
transferred, withheld and paid, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any outstanding obligations to make any such deduction,
transfer, withholding or payment other than with respect to those which have
accrued but are not yet due and payable in the ordinary course of business.

 

(h) Except as provided in _Section 3.11(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company Plans provide for post-employment welfare
benefits for any participant or beneficiary, except to the extent required by
applicable state insurance laws and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended.

 

(i) Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions (alone or together with another event
regardless of whether that other event has occurred or will occur) shall (i)
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) or
benefit becoming due to any current or former employee, director, sales
agent, consultant, independent contractor or any other Person, (ii) increase
any benefits otherwise payable (or the number of individuals entitled to
benefits) under any Company Plan, (iii) accelerate the time of payment,
funding or vesting of any benefits under any Company Plan, except as may be
required by Law, (iv) require any contributions or payments to fund any
obligations under any Company Plan, or (v) limit the right to merge, amend or
terminate any Company Plan.

(j) No employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries are or have been
represented by any labor union, labor organization or any other type of
employee representative or representative body. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has recognized any labor union or labor organization, nor
has any labor union or labor organization been elected as the collective
bargaining agent of any employees. Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(j)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, otherwise bound by, negotiating or is subject to
any liability under any collective bargaining agreement, collective labor,
works council, or similar agreement or arrangement or union contract
recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of any employees,
other than Extension Orders applicable to employees generally. To the
Knowledge of the Company and except as set forth on _Section 3.11(j_) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there has never been any attempt to organize any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor has there ever been
any union organization or collective bargaining activity involving any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor is there any threat
of such. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has never been any
representation or certification proceeding, and no trade union or union
organization has applied or threatened to apply to be certified as the
bargaining agent of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(j)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its

 



24  Subsidiaries is a member in any employers association or organization that
represents employers or bargains on behalf of employers in setting the terms
or conditions of employment for employees, and no such association or
organization has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, intends to make,
any demand for payment of any kind from the Company. There are and have been
no picketing, strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, other job actions,
lockouts, arbitrations, grievances, unfair labor practice charges or
complaints, or other labor disputes involving any of the current or former
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened.

(k) Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(k_) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with and have
complied in all material respects with all Laws relating to labor and
employment and Taxes, and all Contracts, termination notices, and obligations,
collective bargaining agreements or arrangements, whether contractual or
otherwise legally required relating to the terms of the employees employment
therewith, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Collective
Agreement for Pension Insurance in the Industry, all obligations imposed by
Contract and all Laws relating to wage and hour, vacation, severance,
employment of women, collective agreements and arrangements, the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any similar state, provincial

bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, fair employment practices, the
proper classification of employees and independent contractors, immigration,
pay equity, safety and health, workers compensation and the collection and
payment of withholding and/or social security Taxes and any similar Tax, and
the keeping of records in relation to the foregoing. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.11(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no
"mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined by WARN), collective redundancy
or similar action with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in "mass layoff" or
"plant closing" under WARN. No (i) officer, (ii) executive or (iii) other
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary whose function was or is essential
to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been dismissed
in the 24 months immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

(l) Except as provided in _Section 3.11(l)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each Person providing services to the Company and its Subsidiaries
that has been classified as a consultant or independent contractor has been
properly classified under all applicable Laws and the Company and its
Subsidiaries will not suffer damages if such Persons were reclassified by the
courts or any other authority as employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. No current or former consultant or independent contractor of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is entitled to any rights under any applicable
Law or any Company Plan, including Laws relating to labor and employment and
Tax of any applicable jurisdiction, which has not been afforded to such
consultant or independent contractor by the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Board of Directors or
any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or any of its

any financial, accounting, Tax, conflict of interest, illegal activity,
fraudulent or deceptive conduct, discrimination or harassment, or wage and
hour practices with respect to any current or former director, officer,
advisor, consultant or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which, if determined adversely, would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability (including as a result of adverse impact to reputation) to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(o) _Section 3.11(o)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct
and complete list as of May 31, 2011 of: (i) all employees and (ii) employees

dispose of any Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology, or any
products, processes or materials covered thereby in any manner. The Company
has not received any written notice of any such threatened claim nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, are there any facts or circumstances that reasonably
could form the basis for any claim against the Company (including the
Surviving Corporation after the Merger) or any of its Subsidiaries
of infringement, unauthorized use, or violation of any Intellectual Property
or Technology of any Person, or challenging the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology in
any material respect. The Company Intellectual Property and Company
Technology owned or exclusively licensed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
are (i) valid, subsisting and enforceable, (ii) currently in compliance with
any and all formal legal requirements necessary to maintain the validity and
enforceability thereof, and (iii) not subject to any outstanding judgment,
injunction, order, decree, ruling or agreement impairing, restricting or
otherwise adversely affecting the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries use
or licensing thereof or rights thereto, or that would impair the validity or
enforceability thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notification that a license under any other Persons
Intellectual Property is or may be required. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has made any offers of licenses to resolve any alleged

34  or otherwise misusing any Company Intellectual Property or Company
Technology, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any

Schedule, each Person, including each present employee, independent contractor

(including moral rights), title and interest in and to all Intellectual
Property or Technology developed or contributed to by such Person in
connection with such Persons engagement with the Company or Subsidiary (as
applicable), (ii) requires such Person, during and after the term of

employees of the Company or its Israeli Subsidiaries have expressly and
irrevocably waived the right to receive compensation in connection with

consultants, has excluded Intellectual Property and/or Technology made or
conceived prior to such Persons employment with or work for the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries from such Persons assignment of inventions pursuant
to such proprietary invention agreements. To the Knowledge of the Company and
except as set forth in _Section 3.15(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of the
Company or its Subsidiaries who is or was involved in, or who has or will
have contributed to, the creation or development of any Company Intellectual
Property or Company Technology, in whole or in part, has performed services
for, or was an employee of, or was otherwise engaged by any third party
during or prior to the time of such Persons employment or engagement by the
Company or its applicable Subsidiaries, in a manner that may provide the basis
for any claim, interest, or right of such third party with respect to any
owned Company Intellectual Property or owned Company Technology.

(e) No Trade Secret or any other non-public, proprietary information material
to the businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as conducted has
been authorized to be disclosed or has been actually disclosed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any employee or any third Person, other than
pursuant to a written confidentiality or non-disclosure

Intellectual Property or Company Technology. To the Companys Knowledge, no
employee, contractor or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other Person is in default or breach of any term of any employment
agreement, non-disclosure agreement, assignment of invention agreement or
similar agreement relating to the protection, ownership, development, use or
transfer of Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology or any other
Intellectual Property or Technology. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
taken all reasonably necessary and appropriate steps to protect and
preserve the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets and any other confidential
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No rights in any Company
products, Software or services have been transferred or granted to any other
Person except for non-exclusive licenses of Company products granted by the
Company or its Subsidiaries to their customers in the ordinary course of
business.

(f) _Section 3.15(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct
and complete list of all Software that is (i) owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (ii) used or incorporated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in their businesses or Products and not owned by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, in either case other than Software that is readily available
on reasonable terms through commercial distributors or in consumer retail
stores for an annual license fee of less than $100,000.

Schedule, no Publicly Available Software (i) forms part of the Technology
owned or licensed, and relied upon in any material respect, by the Company or
any Subsidiary, (ii) was or is embodied or incorporated, in whole or in part,

Systems") that are necessary for the operations of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries businesses as conducted. The data storage and transmittal
capability, functionality and performance of each individual item in the
Computer Systems and the Computer Systems as a whole are satisfactory in all
material respects for the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses as
conducted. The Computer Systems have not failed in any material manner or
been compromised to any material extent and, to the Companys Knowledge, the
data which they process has not been corrupted or accessed by any unauthorized
Person. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps
in accordance with prudent industry standards to preserve the availability,
security and integrity of the Computer Systems and the data and information

(i) _Section 3.15(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of all Company IP Contracts that are in force,
together with all amendments and supplements thereto and all waivers and
modifications of any terms thereof (and, if oral, an accurate and complete
summary of the terms and conditions thereof), indicating for each
such Company IP Contract the title, parties thereto, date executed and
whether it is exclusive.

 



36 (j) The Company has made available to Parent and Merger Sub accurate and
complete copies of all Company IP Contracts set forth on _Section 3.15(i)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each of the Company IP Contracts set forth
on _Section 3.15(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule is in full force and
effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries, enforceable against them in accordance with its terms. With
respect to each of the Company IP Contracts set forth on _Section 3.15(i)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default in any material respect thereof, nor, to the
Companys Knowledge, has any event occurred which, with notice or the lapse of
time, or both, would give rise to such a default by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the Transactions shall, by itself, constitute a default
under, give rise to cancellation rights under, or otherwise materially
adversely affect any of the rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any Company IP Contract. There are no Contracts or arrangements to which
the Company or any Subsidiary is a party under which any
Governmental Authority acquires rights with respect to any owned or
exclusively licensed Company Software or owned or exclusively licensed Company
Intellectual Property greater than "limited rights" with respect to "technical
data" as defined by the provisions of DFAR 252.227-7013 (Nov. 1995) or
"restricted rights" with respect to Software as defined by the provisions of
DFAR 252.227-7014 (June 1995), nor has any Governmental Authority acquired any
rights outside of any such Contracts, arrangements or subcontract as the
result of providing any funding relating to the development of any Company
Intellectual Property, including any government rights and prerogatives as
defined under the Israeli Patents Law, 1967 including rights under Section
55, Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 thereof.

(k) Consummation of the Transactions will not trigger (i) the creation of any
Lien on any Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology, (ii) Parent
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Affiliates) being
bound by or subject to any non-compete or licensing obligation, covenant not
to sue, or other restriction on the operation or scope of its business, to
which the Company or its Subsidiaries is bound or subject on the date hereof,
or (iii) Parent or any of its Affiliates, or the Company (including the
Surviving Corporation) or any of its Subsidiaries, being obligated to pay any
royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments to any Person with respect to any
Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology in excess of
those payable by the Company and/or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date
hereof.

Schedule, no university, military, educational institution, research center,
Governmental Authority, entity owned or controlled by any Governmental
Authority, or other organization (each, an "RandD Sponsor") has sponsored or
provided funding for research and development conducted in connection with the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted, or has any claim of
right to, ownership of or other Lien on any owned or exclusively licensed
Company Intellectual Property or owned or exclusively licensed Company
Technology. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated
in any standards-setting activities or joined any standards setting or
similar organization that would affect the proprietary nature of any Company
Intellectual Property or Company Technology or restrict the ability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enforce, license or exclude others from
using any Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology. No Person
(including any current and

 



37  former employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) who is or was involved in, or who has or will have
contributed to, the creation or development of any of the owned Company
Intellectual Property or owned Company Technology has performed services for,
was an employee of, or was otherwise engaged (including to the Knowledge of
the Company as a graduate student) by any RandD Sponsor, during the time period
in which such Person was engaged by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
during the period such Person would be deemed under applicable Law to have
contributed to the creation or development of Company Intellectual Property
or Company Technology.

(m) The Company and each of the Subsidiaries has complied with all applicable
Laws and with all applicable Contracts relating to the placement of legends
or restrictive markings on technical data, Software and other proprietary
assets to ensure that no Governmental Authority or other person or entity is
able to acquire any unlimited rights with respect to such technical data,
computer software or Company Intellectual Property.

SECTION 3.16. _Insurance_.  _Section 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all insurance policies
(including information on the premiums payable in connection therewith and the
deductibles, type and amount of the coverage provided thereunder) maintained
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Policies"). The Policies (i)
have been issued by insurers which, to the Knowledge of the Company, are
reputable and financially sound, (ii) provide coverage for the operations
conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries of a scope and with terms and
coverage consistent with customary practice in the industries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate and (iii) are in full force and effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or
default, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action or failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default under, or permit termination or
modification of, any of the Policies. No notice of cancellation or termination
or intent not to renew has been received by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any of the Policies. The consummation of the
Transactions shall not, in and of itself, cause the revocation, cancellation
or termination of any Policy. No carrier or underwriter of any Policy has
asserted any denial of coverage other than the issuance of customary
reservation of rights letters issued by such carriers or underwriters in
connection with the filing of any claims.

SECTION 3.17. _Brokers and Other Advisors; Transaction Expenses_.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any broker

result of the Closing.

 

SECTION 3.18. _Takeover Statutes and Rights Plans_. No "fair price",
"moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation or any anti-takeover provision in the Companys Charter
Documents is applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions. The Company
does not have in effect any "poison pill" or similar plan or agreement which
could delay, render more expensive, or have a dilutive or otherwise adverse
effect as a result of, the consummation of the Merger or the Transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 3.19. _Tangible Personal Property_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all
tangible personal property purported to be owned by the Company and its
Subsidiaries free and clear of Liens, other than the Permitted Exceptions.

and tear excepted) and are suitable for the purposes for which they
are owned, used or held for use.

Subsidiaries is bound ("Personal Property Leases"). All items of personal
property subject to the Personal Property Leases are in good condition and
repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and are suitable for the purposes
used or held for use, and such property is in all material respects in the
condition required of such property by the terms of the Personal Property
Lease applicable thereto during the term thereof. The Company has delivered
to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all Personal Property Leases,
together with all amendments, modifications or supplements thereto.

(c) The Company and each of its applicable Subsidiaries has a valid and
enforceable leasehold interest under each of the Personal Property Leases
under which it is a lessee. Each of the Personal Property Leases is in full
force and effect and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has
received or given any written notice of any default or event that with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof under any of the Personal Property Leases. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no other party is in default under any Personal
Property Lease, and no party to any Personal Property Lease has exercised any
termination rights with respect thereto. Neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions by themselves will
result in any payment, penalty, breach or termination under any Personal
Property Lease, and all such Personal Property Leases shall remain in full
force and effect for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation and its
applicable Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.3. _No Solicitation by the Company; Etc_.

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination

the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and
other representatives (collectively as to any specified Person, its
"Representatives") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, and use (and cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to use) commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the return
from all such Persons or cause the destruction of all copies of any 

 



52  confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf
of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives. The Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, cause, facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries
or proposals that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal, (ii) solicit, encourage or participate in any discussions
or negotiations with any third party regarding any Takeover Proposal or (iii)
enter into any agreement or understanding that reasonably could result in any
Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that if prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval the Board of Directors of the Company receives an
unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof
in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement and the Board of
Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith that (i) such
Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (ii) based upon the advice of its
outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would violate the
Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under the
Israeli Companies Law, then the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval) and after providing Parent not less than 24 hours
written notice of its intention to take such actions, furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that prior to providing any such information,
the Person making the Takeover Proposal and its applicable Representatives
must enter into or be bound by a customary confidentiality agreement with the
Company (which confidentiality agreement must be no less favorable to the
Company ( _i.e._ , no less protective of the Companys information) and no
more favorable to such Person ( _i.e_., no less restrictive with respect to
the conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ ,
_further_ , (i) such confidentiality agreement may not include any exclusive
right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from
complying with its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) the Company must
deliver to Parent all information delivered to such other Person or its
Representatives as promptly as practicable after such information is delivered
to such other Person (to the extent such information was not previously
provided to Parent). Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_ below, the Company shall
provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality
agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph or that otherwise is
binding upon any Person making such Takeover Proposal or its Representatives
as soon as reasonably practical following the execution thereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by or on behalf of the Companys Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the
Company.

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 5.3_, the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than two
business days) after receipt of any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact
regarding any Takeover Proposal, provide Parent a certificate from an
appropriate officer of the Company setting forth the price (including the
form of consideration and any holdback or earnout components), structure and
conditions of any such proposal, offer or inquiry (whether conveyed orally or
in writing) and indicating whether the offeror or inquiring party (or its
ultimate beneficial owner) is a strategic or financial buyer ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no information need be provided regarding the identity of the
offeror), and thereafter shall reasonably and diligently keep Parent informed
of all material developments as they occur affecting the status and terms of
any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests.

 



53 (c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(c)_, neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof (nor any Representative
of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof) shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation or the approval or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors of this Agreement and the Transactions
(including the Merger) or (B) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or cause or
authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement in accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_). Further,
unless the Board of Directors has made or is then considering a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance with this Agreement, the Board of
Directors shall, if requested by Parent, promptly publicly reiterate the
Company Board Recommendation (in a press release, public filing, or other
broadly disseminated communication) after any Takeover Proposal becomes
publicly disclosed, regardless of the circumstances of disclosure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in response to a Superior
Proposal that has not been withdrawn, if such Board determines in good faith,
after reviewing applicable provisions of the Israeli Companies Laws and after
consulting with and receiving advice from its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make such withdrawal or modification would constitute a breach by
the Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under the Israeli Companies Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to
a purportedly Superior Proposal until five business days following Parents
receipt of written notice from the Company (a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Notice") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying all
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that any subsequent amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Adverse
Recommendation Notice and a new three business day post-notice period). Prior
to effecting such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
purportedly Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments and amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such third party Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

SECTION 5.4. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.4(d)_), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties
and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to
use) their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make
effective, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully
all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and

 



54  other documents (including any required or recommended filings under
applicable Antitrust Laws) and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents,
registrations, Permits, rulings, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or other Person necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions, including the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Required Regulatory Consents and the Other Approvals. Without limiting the
foregoing, (A) Parent agrees to refrain (and to cause Merger Sub to refrain)
from taking any action that reasonably would be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and (B) the Company agrees to refrain (and to
cause its Subsidiaries to refrain) from taking any action that reasonably
would be expected to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall provide a copy of _Section 5.2_ and _5.3_ of
this Agreement (including any relevant exceptions in the Company Disclosure
Schedule) to management of each of its Subsidiaries and shall take
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) educate such management of the actions
or omissions which would require Parent approval hereunder and (y) implement
commercially reasonable controls and procedures to minimize the likelihood of
unintentional breaches of the Companys covenants hereunder.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, to the extent
required under applicable Law, (i) each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the RTPA, the
HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust Law, with respect to the Merger as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to any applicable Law, and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the RTPA, the HSR Act or
any other applicable antitrust Law, as soon as reasonably practicable;
and (ii) the Company shall (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no
takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions and (y) if any takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable
to any of the Transactions, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure
that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the

warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue in any
material respect, and (d) any material failure of such party to comply with
or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided_ , _however __,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant

require any replacement or new or additional benefits or grants under any
Company Stock Plans or other incentive compensation plans, agreements or

providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
under a Company Plan during the portion of the plan year of the New Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in the

 



59  corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

SECTION 5.13. _Israeli Approvals_.

(a) _Government Filings_. Without limiting _Sections 5.4_ and _6.2(d)_ ,
each party to this Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to

date of this Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel,
advisors and accountants to prepare and file with the ITA an application for

its submission, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (i)
confirming that the treatment of any Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
subject to Section 102 of the Ordinance in accordance with _Section 2.3_
shall not be regarded as a violation of the requisite holding period, if the
applicable Option Consideration is deposited with the Option Trustee of
such Options and Stock Appreciation Rights until the end of the respective

regularly associated with such a ruling), and (ii) requesting to exempt the

obligation to withhold Israeli Tax from any consideration deposited with or
payable by the Paying Agent, the Option Trustees, the Surviving Corporation or

obligation exists (the "Withholding Tax Ruling"). In the alternative, the
Company shall, if requested by Parent, submit or include in the request for

Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and
accountants to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each other,

preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper
or advisable in support of the request for the Options Tax Ruling and the
Withholding Tax Ruling. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause

proper or advisable under applicable Laws to cause or facilitate obtaining the
Options Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax Ruling, as promptly
as practicable; _provided_ , that obtaining the Options Tax Ruling or
Withholding Tax Ruling shall not be a condition to the Companys obligations
to complete the Merger or any other Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the Withholding Tax Ruling is not obtained prior to the Closing Date,
the Company may instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to
apply to the ITA prior to the Closing Date for an extension of time with
respect to the obligation to deduct or withhold Israeli Tax from the Merger
Consideration, Option Consideration or Warrant Consideration payable pursuant
to this Agreement and if such extension is not granted prior to the date such
payments become due and payable, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may make
such payments and withhold any applicable Israeli Taxes in accordance with
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt (and unless Parent is entitled to

of omission) shall not be deemed to be a breach for purposes of this _Section
6.2(b)_ unless such unintentional breaches result, or would reasonably be
expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or in any of the effects described in _clauses (i)_ through
_(iv)_ of _Section 6.2(c)_. Parent shall have received a certificate signed
on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief

effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the Surviving Corporation

failure of this condition), (ii) shall not have notified Parent or the

Corporation or their applicable Subsidiaries and (iii) shall be bound by
written employment agreements.

been provided an irrevocable written agreement whereby FIMOphir agrees to
surrender the FIMI Warrant to Parent for cancellation at the Effective Time in
exchange for payment of the Warrant Consideration as contemplated by _Section

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that are qualified as to
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in
accordance with their terms, and the representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that are not so qualified shall be
true and correct in all material respects, in each case, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date
(except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date); _provided_ , that
for purposes of this condition, all representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub shall be deemed to be true and correct in all material respects
unless the failure of such representations and warranties (without giving
effect to any limitation as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse
Effect), results, or would reasonably be expected to result, individually or
in the aggregate, in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of
Parent to such effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger
Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to

expected to) have knowledge prior to such act of omission shall not be deemed
to be a breach of this _Section 6.3(b)_ unless such breaches result,
or would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate,
in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall

 



67  have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive
officer of Parent to such effect.

SECTION 6.4. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
6.1_, _6.2_ or _6.3_ to be satisfied, as the case may be, if such failure was
caused by the failure of the party seeking to invoke such condition to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

_Termination_

 

SECTION 7.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time: 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective Boards of Directors; or

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before the Termination Date;
_provided_ __, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party if the failure of
the Merger to have been consummated on or before the Termination Date was
primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement; or

 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effects set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ __,
_however __,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement; or

(iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval is not obtained at the Company
Shareholder Meeting; or

(c) by Parent:

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the
representations or warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall fail to be true), which breach, failure or inaccuracy (A) would (if it
occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ and (B) is incapable of
being cured, or, if susceptible to cure, is not cured by the Company within 30
calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach
or failure; or

 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effects described in _Section 6.2(c)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; or

 



68 (iii) if (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred
or (B) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (x)
shall not have publicly rejected any Takeover Proposal that is not (or after
the process described in _Section 5.3(c)_, is no longer) a Superior
Proposal within three business days of the making thereof (including, for
these purposes, by taking no position in response to a tender offer or
exchange offer, which shall be deemed a failure to reject such Takeover
Proposal) or (y) shall have failed to publicly reconfirm the Company Board
Recommendation within ten business days after receipt of a written request
from Parent that it do so if such request is made following the making by any
Person of a Takeover Proposal that is not (or after the process described in
_Section 5.3(c)_, is no longer) a Superior Proposal; or

(iv) if after the date of this Agreement there shall have occurred any events
or changes that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

 

(d) by the Company:

(i) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall fail to
be true), which breach, failure or inaccuracy (A) would (if it occurred or was
continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or  _(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured,
or, if susceptible to cure, is not cured by Parent within 30 calendar days
following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach or
failure; or

 

(ii) at any time prior to the date the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, if (A) the Companys Board of Directors is entitled to and does
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(c)_ and
(B) the Company immediately enters into a definitive agreement for the
Superior Proposal in response to which the Company validly made the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and (C) prior thereto or concurrently therewith
the Company pays Parent the Expenses and the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Sections 7.3(c)_ and _(d)_.

 

SECTION 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than the provisions of the first sentence of _Section
3.17_, the last sentence of _Section 5.7_, _Sections 5.10_, _5.16_ , _7.2_
and _7.3_ , and _Article VIII_, all of which shall survive termination of
this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates, except (a) any payment obligations of the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.3_, and (b) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for
fraud or for any intentional breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

 



69 SECTION 7.3. _Expense Reimbursement and Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ or
_Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ and (ii) at such time, any Required Regulatory Consent
has not been denied (or, if denied, any applicable appeal or request to
reconsider has been denied), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all
of the Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with _Section 7.3(d)_.

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ or
_Section 7.1(c)(iii)_, and (ii) at such time, Parent is entitled
to reimbursement for Expenses pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, and (iii) within
nine months of the date of termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or there is consummated, a sale or transfer of at
least 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or 50% or more
of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (in each case, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions
and whether through a stock or asset sale, tender or exchange offer, merger,
arrangement under the Israeli Companies Law, or other form of transaction
having the same effect), then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination
fee equal to $9,200,000 (the "Termination Fee") in accordance with _Section
7.3(d)_.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall as a condition to such termination pay
Parent the Expenses and the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
7.3(d)_.

 

(d) Any Expense reimbursement payment required to be made pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)_ shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of this
Agreement by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ (and in any
event not later than two business days after delivery to the Company of
notice of demand for payment accompanied by a reasonable description of the
nature and amount of Expenses incurred). Any Termination Fee payment required
to be made pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ shall be made to Parent promptly
following the earlier of (i) the execution of a definitive agreement with
respect to, and (ii) the date of the consummation of, any transaction (or
series of transactions, if applicable) described in  _Section 7.3(b)(iii)_
(and in any event not later than two business days after delivery to the
Company of notice of demand for payment). Any Expenses and Termination Fee
payments required to be made pursuant to  _Section 7.3(c)_ shall be made
prior to (or concurrently with), and shall be an express condition to, any
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ (provided that the payment of
Expenses in such circumstance may be deferred until no later than two
business days following the Companys receipt of a reasonable description of
the nature and amount of Expenses incurred). All such Expense or Termination
Fee payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Parent in advance. In no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) If the Company fails to pay the Expenses and/or Termination Fee pursuant
to this _Section 7.3_ when due, the unpaid amounts shall accrue interest from
the date such payments were due until paid in full (including any interest
accrued thereon), at a per annum rate equal to the rate of interest publicly
announced by Citibank, in the City of New York from time

 



70  to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate, _plus_ 2% (or
if less, the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law). In addition, the
Company also shall pay to Parent all of Parents costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with efforts
to collect any Termination Fee and/or Expenses (and any interest accrued
thereon), as the case may be. The Company acknowledges that the Expense
reimbursement and Termination Fee rights and the other provisions of this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without
these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(f) Except as provided in _Section 7.2(b)_, once paid, the Termination Fee
and/or the Expenses, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent and Merger Sub following termination of this Agreement.
Upon payment of the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as applicable, the
Company, its officers, shareholders, Affiliates or Representatives shall have
no further liability with respect to this Agreement or its termination;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to
limit any right or remedy with respect to the matters described in  _Section
7.2(b)_.

ARTICLE VIII

SECTION 8.1. _No Survival, Etc_. No information provided or made available,
including any projections, forecasts or estimates of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of this Agreement
or in the Company Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent actually set

no party to this Agreement is relying upon, any representations or warranties
of any nature, whether express or implied, other than the representations and
warranties of the respective parties expressly set forth in this Agreement.
The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall
terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in _Section
7.2_, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, as
the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in _Article II_ and any
other covenant or agreement in this Agreement which contemplates performance
after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely and
those set forth in the first sentence of _Section 3.17_, the last sentence of
_Section 5.7_, _Sections 5.10_, _5.16_ , _7.2_ and _7.3_ , and this

Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective
Boards of Directors; _provided_ __, _however_ , that following receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the
provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the Companys
shareholders without such approval.

 

SECTION 8.3. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance

 



71  of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto and (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained herein or,
except as otherwise provided herein, waive any conditions for the waiving
partys benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any
party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement
on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

SECTION 8.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Merger Sub or Parent of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 8.4_ shall be null and void.

 

SECTION 8.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by original,
facsimile or electronic signature and in two or more counterparts (each of
which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other parties.

SECTION 8.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Fees and
Expenses_. This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,

shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration, (ii) the right of the
holders of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Company Warrants to receive
the Option Consideration or the Warrant Consideration, as applicable, and

Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that damages under this _clause
8.6(iii)_ shall in no event exceed an aggregate amount of $45,000,000 plus the
Companys actual out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and obtaining and enforcing any damages judgment pursuant to this
_clause 8.6(iii)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing right and
remedy shall not be available to the extent the Company seeks and
obtains specific performance pursuant to _Section 8.7(c)_. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

 



72 SECTION 8.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Israel without regard to its conflict or choice of law
principles.

(b) In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute between the parties
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any alleged breach thereof,
either party may demand that the dispute be exclusively resolved through
binding arbitration by so notifying the other party in writing (the
"Arbitration"). The Arbitration shall be conducted in the English language in
London, England, before a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be
appointed, and the Arbitration shall be conducted under the Rules for
International Commercial Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce. The Arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of Israel to the
matters in dispute in the Arbitration, without regard to its choice or
conflicts of law principles. Each party shall participate in good faith
in the Arbitration, shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with the
Arbitration and shall share the cost of the arbitrator equally. The
arbitrators decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to
the Arbitration, and if either party requests the Arbitration shall be the
exclusive forum and dispute resolution procedure for any claims arising out of
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , that any party may
seek and obtain injunctive relief as contemplated by subparagraph (c) below
pending the Arbitration. The parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such arbitration proceeding
in London conducted under such arbitration rules and further irrevocably and
unconditionally waive and agree not to claim in any court or other proceeding
that any such action, suit or proceeding has been brought in an inappropriate
or inconvenient forum.

 

(c) Each party recognizes and acknowledges that a breach of its covenants and
obligations in this Agreement would cause irreparable loss and damage to the
other party as to which that party would not have an adequate remedy at law
and for which monetary damages alone would not suffice. Accordingly, each
party agrees that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms of this Agreement, and to seek and obtain an injunction or other
equitable remedy as a remedy for (or to prevent) any breach of this Agreement.
Each party further agrees that the parties shall be entitled to the entry of
an order by an appropriate court in Tel Aviv, Israel to enforce any specific
performance, injunctive or other equitable remedy granted, in addition to any
other remedy to which that party may be entitled, at law or in equity. No
party shall be required to post any bond or prove damages as a condition to
seeking or obtaining specific performance, an injunction or other equitable
relief or to obtain the entry of any such order in a court located in Tel
Aviv, Israel.

 

SECTION 8.8. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder (and any responses or consents to any request) shall be in
writing and shall be deemed validly given if delivered personally (including
via e-mail), by telecopier (which is electronically confirmed) or sent by
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to the parties at
the following addresses:
