Sellers have represented to Buyer that the Working Capital of the Companies as of February 28, 2010 is and that the Working Capital of the Companies as of the Effective Time (" _Effective Time Working Capital_ ") will be a reasonably sufficient level of Working Capital to support the operations of the Purchased Business in a manner consistent with the historical operations of the Purchased Business and assuming normal operating conditions.

      ##### 

  

    

or in general economic conditions in the industries or markets in which any

Accordingly, Buyer and Sellers shall, following the Closing Date, true-up such payments and receipts in accordance with the normal and customary settlement procedures of the Sellers with the applicable Party (Sellers or Buyer) making net adjustment payments as necessary to effect the true-up and give effect to the transfer of the Purchased Business at the Effective Time.

In the event that a Pending Contract has not been entered into as of the Pending Contracts Adjustment Date and a contract value adjustment payment has been made by Sellers to Buyer with respect to such Pending Contract but such Pending Contract is entered into subsequent to the Pending Contracts Adjustment Date but prior to the first anniversary of the Closing, then a true up payment shall be made by Buyer to Sellers using the same methodology as set forth in Section 2.6 in order to reverse all or part of the initial contract value adjustment payment in light of the incremental economics attributable to the Pending Contract at the time of its execution by the Company.

If (i) Sellers so furnish supplemental information, (ii) the absence of such information would have resulted in a breach of any representation or warranty under this Agreement and (iii) the Closing occurs, then such information shall be deemed to amend this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules for all purposes hereunder, _provided_ if such supplemental disclosure would result in Losses to the Companies in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate then Buyer may elect, by written notice to Sellers, to terminate this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall preserve and keep a copy of all books and records (other than Tax Records which are addressed in Article VII) relating to the business or operations of the Companies on or before the Closing Date in Buyers possession for a period of at least seven years after the Closing Date.

To the extent that Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies) incur any costs in breaking, terminating, substituting or transferring hedge agreements or arrangements in connection with the foregoing covenant (" _Hedge Transfer Breakup Costs_ ") then Sellers will bear such Hedge Transfer Breakup Costs. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (b) In the event that Sellers are unable to or otherwise elect not to effect a transfer to the Companies of any Business Hedges, then Sellers will continue to hold and maintain such retained Business Hedges for the benefit of the Companies and the Purchased Companies and the Buyer and Sellers will make true-up payments on a calendar quarter basis following the Closing as necessary to provide to Buyer the economic impact (whether positive or negative) of any such Business Hedges held by Sellers. To the extent the retained Business Hedges have a positive economic impact through the applicable calendar quarter then Sellers will make a corresponding cash true-up payment to Buyer and to the extent the retained Business Hedges have a negative economic impact through the applicable calendar quarter then Buyer will make a corresponding cash true up payment to Sellers. Such true-up payments will be made within twenty (20) days following the end of each calendar quarter.

 (b) At the Closing, or as promptly as is reasonably practicable, Sellers shall request that the Title Company issue to Buyer one or more owners title insurance policies in accordance with the Title Commitments, together with any customary endorsements thereto requested by Buyer, and subject only to Permitted Liens and defects in title that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the ability of the Companies to conduct the Purchased Business (the " _Title Policies_ ").

 (a) Sellers shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all amounts paid to Sellers or their Affiliate insureds in respect of any business interruption, and/or contingent business interruption claim(s) relating to the Companies or the Purchased Business in the event the entire period of business interruption occurred on or prior to the Effective Time. In the event the period of business interruption includes periods prior to and after the Effective Time: (i) Sellers shall assume any associated waiting period days and be entitled to receive and retain the business interruption proceeds (the " _BI Proceeds_ ") attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time and (ii) Buyer shall assume any associated waiting period days and be entitled to receive and retain the BI Proceeds attributable to the period after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) To the extent that Sellers have made payments to repair property damage of Company Assets prior to the Effective Time, Sellers shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all amounts paid to Sellers or their Affiliate insureds in respect of such property damage whether received prior to, on or after the Effective Time.

ARTICLE VII 
 TAX MATTERS 

   

 Section 7.1 _Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) Through the Closing, Sellers shall cause each of the Companies to continue their current tax treatment as (a) partnerships or (b) entities that are disregarded as separate from their owner for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b)(1), and the operations of each of the Companies through the close of business on the actual Closing Date as determined without regard to the final clause of Section 2.3(a) which provides for the Effective Time (the " _Effective Tax Time_ ") shall be reflected on the federal income Tax Return of its owners. The income of the Companies will be apportioned to the period up to and including the Effective Tax Time, and the period after the Effective Tax Time by closing the books of the Companies as of the Effective Tax Time except as otherwise provided below in Section 7.1(c). 

   

 (b) With respect to any Tax Return of a Company covering a taxable period ending on or before the Effective Tax Time that is required to be filed after the Effective Tax Time, Sellers shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared and shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax items required to be included therein. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of each such Tax Return, Sellers shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Buyer together with a statement of the difference, if any, of the amount of Tax shown due on such Tax Return over the amount set up as a liability for such Tax (for the period through the Effective Tax Time) in the Effective Time Working Capital. Sellers shall make all reasonable changes to such Tax Return requested by Buyer not later than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. If the Tax shown on the Tax Return exceeds the amount set up as a liability for the Tax (for the period through the Effective Tax Time) in the Effective Time Working Capital, not later than the due date of such Tax Return, Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of such excess. If the amount set up as a liability for the Tax (for the period through the Effective Tax Time) in the Effective Time Working Capital exceeds the Tax shown on the Tax Return, not later than the due date of such Tax Return, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess. Buyer shall cause the Company to file the Tax Return and timely pay the Taxes shown due on such Tax Return. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) With respect to any Tax Return of a Company covering a taxable period beginning on or before the Effective Tax Time and ending after the Effective Tax Time that is required to be filed after the Effective Tax Time, Buyer shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared and shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax items required to be included therein. Buyer shall determine (by an interim closing of the books as of the Effective Tax Time except for ad valorem Taxes and franchise taxes based solely on capital which shall be prorated on a daily basis) the Tax which would have been due with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return if such taxable period ended on the Effective Tax Time (the " _Pre-Closing Tax_ "). For this purpose, any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to a Company shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, and not to the taxable period for which payment of the Tax provides the right to engage in business. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of each such Tax Return, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Sellers for their review. Buyer shall make all reasonable changes to such Tax Return requested by Sellers not later than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Not later than the due date of the Tax Return, either (i) Sellers shall pay to Buyer the excess, if any, of the Pre-Closing Tax over the amount set up as a liability for the Pre-Closing Tax in the Effective Time Working Capital, or (ii) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the excess, if any, of the amount set up as a liability for the Pre-Closing Tax in the Effective Time Working Capital over the Pre-Closing Tax. Buyer shall cause the Company to file the Tax Return and timely pay the Taxes shown due on such Tax Return. 

   

 (d) Any Tax Return prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.1 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except as otherwise required by Law or fact. Any dispute arising pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) shall be resolved pursuant to procedures comparable to the procedures applicable under Section 2.4(a). 

   

 (e) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully, and Buyer shall cause each of the Companies to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.1 (and Section 7.6), requests for the provision of any information or documentation within the knowledge or possession of the other Party as reasonably necessary to facilitate compliance with financial reporting obligations arising under FASB Statement No. 109 (including without limitation, compliance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48), and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include access to, the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Sellers will, and Buyer will cause the Companies to, (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Effective Tax Time until the later of six (6) years after the Effective Tax Time or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods (including any extensions thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and 

      ##### 

  

    

Sellers each agree, upon request, to use Reasonable Efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Tax Authority or any other Person as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 7.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be responsible for and indemnify Sellers for the payment of all state and local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes resulting from the purchase of the Companies. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Tax Indemnity_. 

  

 (a) Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable for, shall pay and shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the Companies from (i) any breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.9 and (ii) any and all Taxes in excess of any liability for Taxes (for the period through the Effective Tax Time) reflected in the Effective Time Working Capital which relate to or result from the income, business, property or operations of the Companies prior to the Effective Tax Time. The representations and warranties contained in Section 4.9 shall survive the Closing until six months after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Buyer shall be solely liable for, shall pay and shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from any and all Taxes, together with costs and expenses with respect thereto, which relate to or result from the income, business, property or operations of the Companies after the Effective Tax Time. 

   

 (b) If any claim (an " _Indemnified Tax Claim_ ") is made by any Tax Authority that, if successful, would result in indemnification of any Party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") by another Party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") under this Section 7.3, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event later than the earlier of (i) forty-five (45) days after receipt of notice from the Tax Authority of such claim or (ii) fifteen (15) days prior to the date required for the filing of any protest of such claim, notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact, including a description in reasonable detail of the nature of the Indemnified Tax Claim, and a copy of all papers received with respect to such claim (if any). 

   

 (c) The Tax Indemnifying Party shall control all decisions with respect to any Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnified Party shall take such action (including settlement with respect to such Tax Proceeding or the prosecution of such Tax Proceeding to a determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or appellate jurisdiction) in connection with a Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax Claim as the Tax Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including the selection of counsel and experts and the execution of powers of attorney; _provided_ that (i) if within thirty (30) days after the notice required by Section 7.3(b) has been delivered (or such earlier date that any payment of Taxes with respect to such claim is due but in no event sooner than five days after the Tax Indemnifying Partys receipt of such notice), the Tax Indemnifying Party requests that such claim be contested, and (ii) if the Tax Indemnified Party is requested by the Tax Indemnifying Party to pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have advanced to the Tax Indemnified Party, on an interest-free basis, the amount of such claim. The Tax Indemnified Party shall not make any payment of an Indemnified Tax Claim for at least thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as may be required by applicable law) after the giving of the notice required by Section 7.3(b) with respect to such claim, shall give to the Tax 

      ##### 

  

    

Indemnifying Party any information requested related to such claim, and
otherwise shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in order to contest
effectively any such claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.3 to
the contrary, (i) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Tax Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any compromise or settlement
regarding an Indemnified Tax Claim that will effect taxable periods ending
after the Effective Tax Time or that involves issues that recur for taxable
periods ending after the Effective Tax Time, (ii) the Tax Indemnified Party
may participate in, but not control (subject to clause "(iii)" below),
any defense or settlement of any Indemnified Tax Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 7.3, and the Tax Indemnified
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation, and (iii) if the Tax Indemnifying Party fails to take action to
timely defend an Indemnified Tax Claim, then the Tax Indemnified Party shall
have the exclusive right to defend, and be reimbursed by the Tax Indemnifying
Party for its reasonable cost and expense, in regard to the Indemnified Tax
Claim with counsel selected by the Tax Indemnified Party, in which case the
Tax Indemnified Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings;
_provided, however_ , that the Tax Indemnified Party may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such Indemnified Tax Claim if indemnification is
to be sought hereunder, without the Tax Indemnifying Partys consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

 Section 7.4 _Scope_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Article VII shall be the exclusive remedy for any claims relating to Taxes (including any claims relating to representations respecting Tax matters including Section 4.9). The rights under this Article VII shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions) applicable to such Tax matter. No claim may be made or brought by any Party hereto after the expiration of the applicable survival period unless such claim has been asserted by written notice specifying the details supporting the claim on or prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Tax Refunds_. In the event that Buyer receives any refund of Taxes from a taxing jurisdiction or a reimbursement of Taxes from a third-party with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period, such amounts shall belong to Sellers and shall be forwarded by Buyer to Sellers within ten days of receipt. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Buyer and Seller agree that (i) the aggregate Purchase Price will be allocated among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Code Section 1060 and the regulations thereto, (ii) they will cooperate to timely and promptly prepare and mutually agree on such allocation, (iii) they will file all Tax Returns and related forms (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in accordance with such allocation, and (iv) they will not make any inconsistent statement or take any inconsistent position on any Tax Returns, in any refund claim or during the course of any examination of a Tax Return by any Tax Authority. Each party will notify the other party if it receives notice that a Tax Authority proposes any allocation that is different from the allocation as agreed by them.

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall have a duty to use Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Loss arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

     ##### 

 

  

asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third-Party Claim_
") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under Section
9.2 shall promptly (i) notify the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
of the Third-Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the
Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if
any), the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses
attributable to the Third-Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified
Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to timely
provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified
Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 9.3(b).

If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person.

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third-Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 9.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

 (a) a breach of any representation, warranty or pre-Closing covenant (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) of Sellers in this Agreement in connection with any single item or group of related items that results in Losses of less than $250,000 shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Article IX not to be a breach of such representation, warranty or pre-Closing covenant; 

  

 (b) Sellers shall have no liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches of representations or warranties (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) except if the aggregate Losses actually incurred by Buyer Indemnified Parties thereunder exceed $6,300,000 (and then, subject to Section 9.4(c), only to the extent such aggregate Losses exceed such amount); 

  

 (c) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches of representations, warranties or pre-Closing covenants (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) exceed $46,200,000; 

  

 (d) The amount of any Loss for which a Buyer Indemnified Party claims indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by: (i) any insurance proceeds actually recovered with respect to such Loss; (ii) any Tax Benefits with respect to such Loss and (iii) indemnification or reimbursement payments actually recovered from third parties with respect to such Loss; 

  

 (e) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty by a party in connection with the assertion of a claim for indemnification under Article IX, or determining the amount of a Loss, with respect to any asserted breach or inaccuracy, such determination shall be made without regard to any qualifier as to "material," "materiality" or Material Adverse Effect expressly contained in Article III or IV.

   #####

 (d) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 11.12 _Further Assurances_. 

  

 (a) Buyer acknowledges that in some instances only beneficial ownership to the Company Assets will have been transferred to the Companies at the Closing and record title may be transferred to Buyer or the Companies following the Closing.
