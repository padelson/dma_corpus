Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub to the Company prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
" _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (each section of which qualifies the

which the disclosure on its face is reasonably apparent that such disclosure
is responsive to such other numbered and lettered Section of this _Article 5_
and,  _provided_ , _however_ , that any listing of any fact, item or
exception disclosed in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not
be construed as an admission of liability under any Applicable Law and shall
not be construed as an admission that such fact, item or exception is in fact
material or creates a measure of materiality for purpose of this Agreement or
otherwise), each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to
the Company that the statements contained in this _Article 5_ are true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (except

operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
approvals, qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to

Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

own or use any assets required for the conduct of their businesses or result
in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, first
offer, first refusal, modification or acceleration of any obligation or to
the loss of a benefit under, or otherwise contravene, any Contract to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which or to which any of their
respective properties, rights or assets are bound or subject, or result in the
creation of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens) in each case, upon any of
the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, except for such losses,
suspensions, limitations, impairments, violations, defaults, rights,
contraventions or Liens as would not reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any
provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub or (iii)
conflict with or violate Applicable Law or any Orders in any way that would

this Agreement or the Support Agreements.

only to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, to provide or cause
to be provided the Bridge Financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein
and (ii) any related fee letters referred to in the Commitment Letter
(redacted for provisions related to fee amounts and the economic terms of the

the availability of the Bridge Financing or the timing of the Closing, other
than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter furnished to the
Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would

other fees in connection with the Commitment Letter that are required to be

against Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

 



42 (d) There are no conditions precedent or other contractual contingencies
related to funding the full amount of the Bridge Financing on the Closing
Date other than those expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the
date hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
__ _ 7.01_ or Section __ _ 7.02_, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that (x) any of the conditions to the Bridge Financing will not be
satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or (y) the full amount of the Bridge
Financing necessary for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, if any, will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date.

in _Article 4_ , (ii) the compliance by the Company and its Affiliates with
their respective obligations hereunder and (iii) the conditions set forth
in Section __ _ 7.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ are satisfied at the

consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including all related fees
and expenses required to be paid as of the date of the consummation of the

contemplated hereby.

Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates has entered
into any Contract with any stockholder of the Company or any member of the
Companys management or directors that is related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for the Support Agreements.

acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an adequate opportunity to discuss
the business of the Company and its subsidiaries with the Company, (b) has had
reasonable access to (i) the books and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries and (ii) the documents provided by the Company for purposes of

that none of the Company or any of its stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives has made any
representation or warranty concerning any estimates, projections, forecasts,
business plans or other forward-looking information regarding the Company, its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses and operations. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to develop such estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans
and other forward-looking information with which Parent and Merger Sub are
familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information
furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-
looking information), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim
against the Company or any of its stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives with respect
thereto, except in the case of fraud.

or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to or result
in, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction (any such document,
agreement or arrangement, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Written Consent by the Company,
in the event a material development or material change in circumstances (other
than relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Transaction or Superior
Proposal) occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was not
known and not reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation if and
only if the Company Board determines in 

 



50  good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
outside financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that the Company shall have provided Parent three (3) Business Days prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and:

and employees and directed and otherwise used its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their other Representatives, including its outside legal counsel

with Parent and its Representatives) regarding improvements to the terms of

irrevocable and in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no
later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the third (3rd) Business Day of such
three (3) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors)
that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Alternative Transaction End Time, if, in response to an
unsolicited, written bona fide Acquisition Proposal made after the date of
this Agreement that did not result from a material breach of this _Section_ __
_ 6.04_, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors) that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to
approve such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under Applicable Law, the Company may terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ and this  _Section_ __ _
6.04(d)_ (and concurrently therewith take the actions described in clauses (i)
and (ii) of the first sentence of Section __ _ 6.04(c)_); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(d)_ unless the
Company (x) has first complied with Section __ _ 6.04(e)_, (y) pays, or
causes to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to
Section __ _ 8.03(a)(ii)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination and

definitive written acquisition agreement for such Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.04(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_, unless (x) the
Company shall have provided to Parent three (3) Business Days prior written
notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company
intends to take such action (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
for such action and the terms 

 



51  and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the
Third Party who has made such Superior Proposal) and provided Parent a copy of
the relevant proposed transaction agreement or the latest draft thereof
(including any related financing commitments, fee letters and other
transaction documents received by the Company) or, if no such agreement, draft
commitments, letters or documents exist, a written summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (y):

(i) during such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (and the
Company shall have caused its Affiliates and its and their directors, officers
and employees and directed its and their other Representatives, including its
outside legal counsel and outside financial advisor, to have engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives) regarding improvements
to the terms of this Agreement or any other proposal intended to cause
such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) the Company shall have considered any Proposed Changed Terms proposed by
Parent no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the third (3rd) Business Day
of such three (3) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors) that (x) the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect and
(y) the failure to approve such Superior Proposal would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law.

The parties acknowledge and agree that, (A) if Parent, within three (3)
Business Days following its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, makes
Proposed Changed Terms that, as determined in good faith by the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside counsel and outside financial advisors),
results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior
Proposal, then the Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.04(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ as a
result of such Acquisition Proposal (on such terms), and (B) any (1) revisions
to the financial terms or any other material terms of a Superior Proposal or
(2) revisions to the financial terms or any other material terms to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
and shall in each case require the Company to deliver to Parent a new
Superior Proposal Notice and comply with this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(e)_ and a
new two (2) Business Day period (in lieu of a three (3) Business Day period)
shall commence thereafter.

its Subsidiaries, any of its or its Subsidiaries officers, directors or
employees or, to the Companys Knowledge, any of its or its Subsidiaries
Representatives receives any bona fide Acquisition Proposal, and in connection
with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and conditions
(including the identity of the Third Party making any such Acquisition
Proposal, copies of any documentation and a written summary of any oral
proposals) of any such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any determination by the
Company Board pursuant to Section __ _ 6.04(b)_ or (iii) any material
changes to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, including copies of any
amended or revised documentation with respect to such material changes.

 



52 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item

"stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making

complete copies of Tax Returns and other records relating to Taxes) and shall
furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and other data and
information, in each case, in the Companys possession as Parent and Merger
Sub through their Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to
provide any such access which would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company counsel, (i) violate any Applicable Law, or (ii) result in a loss or
waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries (it being agreed that the Company shall give
notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) above, and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the
applicable privilege or protection or violate the Applicable Law).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such access shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any unreasonable
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such officers, employees
and other Representatives of their normal duties and shall not include any
environmental sampling or invasive environmental testing without the Companys
prior written consent. All requests for access or information made pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ shall be directed to an executive officer or other

acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-
takeover law or regulation becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as

anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

shall maintain officers and directors liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such

Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the
Surviving Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum
coverage available for an aggregate premium equal to 300% of the Current
Premium. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been
obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time or by the Surviving
Corporation at or after the Effective Time, which policies provide each such
Person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy with coverage and amount no less favorable in any material

an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the amount paid for such prepaid policies shall not exceed 300% of the Current
Premium without the prior written consent of Parent. If such prepaid policies

any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") and (ii) any
indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
certificate of incorporation, as amended, or bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



55 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party, against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, arising out
of, relating to or in connection with matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time by virtue of the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware Law and its
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date of
this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and the Surviving Corporation shall
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
the defense of any such Proceeding, including any expenses incurred in
successfully enforcing such Persons rights under this Section __ _ 6.09_;
provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section __ _ 6.09_ or
Applicable Law). In the event of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification has been sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (y) the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such matter and (z) the Indemnified Party shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which
indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder without
the prior written consent of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). In the event any Proceeding is
brought against any Indemnified Party and in which indemnification or
advancement is sought by such Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _
6.09_, the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense
thereof after the Effective Time. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_, upon learning of any such
Proceeding, shall promptly notify Parent thereof.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by
Contract or otherwise.

Section 6.10 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein the Company and Parent shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and

waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities, the expiry or
early termination of any applicable waiting periods, and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or Proceeding by, any
Governmental Entities, (ii) the delivery of required notices to, and the
obtaining of required consents or waivers from, Third Parties and (iii) the

or permitted to pay, and Parent shall not be obligated to pay or permit or
agree to the Company paying, any material cash consideration to any Third
Party from whom consent or approval is required and the Company shall not be
required or permitted to modify or enter into any Contract or Company Real
Property Lease or limit or dispose of any non-cash rights, assets or
properties, and Parent shall not be obligated to permit or agree to the
Companys modification or entrance into any Contract or Company Real Property
Lease or, on behalf of itself or any of its pre-Closing Affiliates, modify or

properties, in each case pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ or any
provision that cross-references the proviso to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_.
Parent shall have the right to control the strategy, tactics and other aspects
of obtaining clearances under the HSR Act or other Applicable Laws or
consents of Third Parties.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_, each of Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall

request early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act), each of Parent and the Company shall make or cause to be made the
appropriate filing within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof.

 

(c) Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information and the
last sentence of Section __ _ 6.10(a)_, the Company and Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and counsel shall (i) provide each other

in good faith the views of the other in connection with all communications

to Proceedings under the Antitrust Laws) with a Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) promptly inform
each other of any material communication (or other material correspondence or

with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) agree not to
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other party not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company and Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall, to the extent practicable, provide the
other party and its counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to
participate in any material discussion or meeting with any Governmental Entity
in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties may designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this _Section_
__ _ 6.10(c)_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein 

 



57  shall be given only to outside counsel and previously-agreed outside
economic consultants of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel or outside economic consultants to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party
providing such materials. This _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ shall not apply in
respect of Taxes.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, Parent shall not be
required to, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, offer, propose, agree, or commit (i) to sell, divest, hold separate,
license, cause a Third Party to acquire, or otherwise dispose of (A) any of
the respective Affiliates of the Company or Parent or (B) any of
the respective operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers,
assets, properties or rights of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, prior to, contemporaneously with or after the Closing and
regardless as to whether a Third Party purchaser must be identified or
approved prior to the Closing (a " _Divestiture_ "), (ii) to take any other
actions that may limit Parents, its Affiliates, the Companys or its
Affiliates conduct in any way or any of the foregoings freedom of action
with respect to, or ability to retain, one or more of its operations,
divisions, businesses, products lines, customers, assets, properties or rights
(a " _Restraint_ ") or (iii) to enter into any Order, consent decree or other
agreement to effectuate a Divestiture or Restraint, except to the extent that
such actions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) above would not be
reasonably likely to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the business, assets, Liabilities, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company.

 

(e) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree
to acquire, in any manner, any business, Person or assets, or take any other
action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition or other action, would reasonably be expected
to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase
the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders or
declarations of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv)
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 6.11  _Financing_.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.11(d)_, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Bridge Financing (or the Permanent Financing in lieu thereof) on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (including the
related "flex" provisions), including using reasonable best efforts to enforce
its rights and exercise any remedies under the Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the
status of Parents efforts to obtain the Financing and shall give the Company
prompt notice of any fact, change, event or circumstance that is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact on
any portion of the Financing necessary for the satisfaction of all
of Parents obligations under this Agreement.

 



58 (c) Parent may amend, modify, replace, terminate, assign or agree to any
waiver or reduction of commitments under, the Commitment Letter and/or
substitute commitments under the Commitment Letter with commitments or
proceeds in respect of any Permanent Financing, in each case without the prior
written approval of the Company; _provided_ , that Parent shall not, without
the Companys prior written consent, permit any such amendment, replacement,
modification, assignment, termination, waiver, reduction or substitution to be
made, or consent to any waiver of any provision of or remedy under the
Commitment Letter which would (i) reduce the aggregate cash amounts of the
Financing to an aggregate amount less than the amount necessary for the
representation in _Section_ __ _ 5.06(e)_ to be true at the time of any such
change, (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the funding of the
Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions
under the Commitment Letter in each case from those set forth in the
Commitment Letter on the date hereof in a manner that would (A) materially
delay or prevent the Closing or (B) make the funding of any portion of the
Financing necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement less likely to occur or (iii) otherwise adversely affect the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter or
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may modify, supplement or amend the Commitment Letter
to (1) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement and (2) implement or exercise any "market flex" provisions
contained in any related fee letters. In the event that new commitment letters
are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of the Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_, such new commitment letters shall be deemed to be the
"Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement (other than with
respect to representations in this Agreement made by Parent that speak only
as of the dates hereof). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies
of any termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the
Commitment Letter.

 

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice if and when Parent
becomes aware that all or any portion of the Bridge Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter will not be available other than as contemplated by
Section 6.11(c). If any portion of the Bridge Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (other than as
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and any "market flex" provisions in any
related fee letters) and such portion is necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing,
including from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Bridge Financing that is available and any cash of Parent and
its Subsidiaries on hand at the Closing Date (including the proceeds of any
Permanent Financing), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
agreement (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event;  _provided_ , that Parent shall not be
obligated to seek or obtain Alternative Financing on terms and conditions
materially less favorable to Parent in the aggregate than the Bridge Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter. All references to the Bridge Financing
shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing and all references to
the Commitment Letter shall include the applicable documents for the
Alternative Financing.

(40) days prior to the Closing Date (but, excluding the fourth quarter of any
fiscal year), prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with unaudited
financial statements for the corresponding period of the prior year (and in
the case of clauses (A) and (B) meeting the requirements of Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, (it being understood and agreed that

60 (v) consent to the use of the Companys and the Companys Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to or is reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section __ _ 6.12_ to the contrary, in
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action
that would:

 

(i) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries;

Materials if, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, such disclosure

statements or any financial statements, projections, other forward-looking
information or other information that are not available to it and prepared in

Documents, any Applicable Laws or under any material Contract or (y) require
the Company to provide access to or disclose information that the Company
reasonably determines would result in a loss or waiver of attorney-client
privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries (in each case it being agreed
that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents pursuant to this clause (v)(y), and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause
such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to violate the applicable restriction or waive the applicable
privilege or protection);

(xii) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in this Agreement to not be

cooperation or other actions taken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_
except in the event such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, awards, judgments and penalties arise out of or result from the
fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith by the Company or its
Affiliates or such directors, officers, managers, employees and

Section 6.13 _Company Existing Indebtedness_. The Company shall use reasonable

62  respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement
without the consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as such release or announcement that
Parent or the Company determines, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, is required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule
of any securities exchange upon which the securities of the Company or Parent,
as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow
the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances) to
comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the
party required to make the release or announcement will consider such comments
in good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may make public
statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including their effect on Parents business and its financial
projections, with investors, analysts and Financing Sources, including on its
periodic earnings calls and in any "road show", so long as Parents comments

communications) previously issued and agreed upon by the parties.

Section 6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall (and shall be permitted to) take all actions as may be reasonably
requested by any party hereto to cause any dispositions of equity securities

Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

 

Section 6.17 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Until December 31, 2018 (or such shorter period as the applicable
Continuing Company Employee continues to be employed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation) and subject to Applicable Law, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Continuing Company
Employee with employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that, in
the aggregate, are at least as favorable as the employee benefits (excluding
equity-based compensation) provided to such Continuing Company Employee under
the Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time. For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time (or such
shorter period as the applicable Continuing Company Employee continues to be
employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation) and subject to Applicable
Law, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to each Continuing Company Employee (i) at least the same level of
hourly salary or base wages and annual target bonus opportunity as provided to
such Continuing Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii), such equity-based compensation and other long-term incentive
compensation substantially similar to that provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable
than the severance benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent.

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the

 



63  service of each Continuing Company Employee with the Company prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and, solely for purposes of
any vacation and severance benefits, levels of benefits under such Post-
Closing Plans, in each case, to the same extent such service was recognized
immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit
Plan in which such Continuing Company Employee was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of
service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any plan that provides retiree
welfare benefits, (ii) apply for purposes of benefit accruals
or participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or plan
providing post-retirement pension plan benefits, (iii) operate to duplicate
any benefits of a Continuing Company Employee with respect to the same period
of service, or (iv) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement
(x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do
not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to
any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance
benefits, for the plan year in which such Continuing Company Employee is first
eligible to participate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (A)
cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Company Employee
to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Continuing
Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical, dental or vision
expenses incurred by such Continuing Company Employee in the year that
includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Continuing
Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such Post-Closing Plan)
for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such
expenses would have been credited under the Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
subject to the applicable information being provided to Parent in a form that
Parent reasonably determines is administratively feasible to take into
account under its plans. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any
annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations
that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. To the
extent the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to Parents request, the
Continuing Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.

(d) The Company will provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such
communications relate to the compensation, employment or labor aspects of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such communications prior to
distribution.

 



64 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program or Contract maintained or sponsored by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after
the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or
benefit or employment plan, program or Contract after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.17_ shall create any Third Party beneficiary rights in
any Company Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or
its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Consent_ "), the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of such Stockholder
Written Consent. In connection with execution and delivery of the Stockholder

material respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and
any other Applicable Law, except that the Company shall have no such
obligation with respect to statements made in the Information Statement based
on information supplied by Parent expressly for inclusion therein. The Company
shall cause the definitive Information Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) that is filed with the SEC and at the time the definitive
Information Statement is mailed to the stockholders of the Company, to not (i)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or (ii) omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that the Company shall have no such obligation with
respect to statements made therein based on information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub expressly for inclusion therein.

 



65 (d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Information Statement or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it to the Company specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will when
filed with the SEC and at the time it is mailed to holders of Company
Common Stock, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. Parent further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any such information would cause any of the statements in the
Information Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the Company and to take
appropriate steps to correct the Information Statement. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the
Information Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof and to have the Information Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC
as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing.

 

(e) No amendment or supplement to the Information Statement shall be made by
Company without the reasonable advance notice to Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly
provide notice to Parent of any correspondence or communications with or
comments from the SEC and shall provide Parent with copies of all such
written comments and written correspondence. The Company shall not submit any
response letters or other correspondence to the SEC without the approval of
Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Company shall (i) provide Parent with reasonable prior notice
of any scheduled telephone calls between the Company or its Representatives
and the SEC, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to allow Parent or its
Representatives to participate in all such telephone calls.

(f) Prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response and
shall, in good faith, consider the reasonable comments of Parent. As promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Information Statement has been cleared by
the SEC or promptly after ten (10) calendar days have passed since the date of
filing of the preliminary Information Statement with the SEC without notice
from the SEC of its intent to review the Information Statement, the Company
shall file with the SEC the Information Statement in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially
in the form previously cleared or filed with the SEC, as the case may be, and
mail a copy of the Information Statement to Companys stockholders of record
in accordance with Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL.

_Section_ __ _ 8.01_; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein

Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination (which liability shall
include, in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, liability to the

Section 8.03 _Company Termination_ _Payments_.

(a) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated by:

 

(i) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(iii)_ or either Parent or the
Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_, and in any such case (x)

70  Acquisition Proposal or the entry into a definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, (x) in the case of _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)(ii)_,
immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination, and (y) in the
case of _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)(iii)_, promptly, but in no event later than

suit which results in an Order against the Company for such amounts or any
portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub their costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company

Lenders.

 

(b) Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the
Effective Time by any of the parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a
written instrument signed by each such party granting such waiver. No failure

respective successors, and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations
or Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except for (i) the

Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out
of or related hereto or to the Merger or to the inducement of any party
hereto to enter into this Agreement (whether for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Applicable Law of the State of Delaware, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such State that would refer a matter to the laws of another
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except to the extent relating to
the interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement (including those
provisions of, and references to, this Agreement that are referred to, or
incorporated by reference in, the Commitment Letter), the parties hereto
agree that any Proceeding of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in
contract or in tort, to which the Debt Financing Sources are a party in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to the Commitment Letter or
the Financing (including the transactions contemplated thereby) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Applicable Law of the State
of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause application of the Applicable Law of any jurisdiction other
than the State of New York.

 

Section 9.07 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom, or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have
proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware
located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom. Each party
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in
respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to
enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it
is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the
Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party
agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 9.01_ or in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

 



74 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this Section __ _ 9.07_), each party agrees that it will not bring or
support, or permit any of their controlled Affiliates to bring or support, any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or the Financing, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom).

 

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR INVOLVING A DEBT FINANCING SOURCE.

 

Section 9.09 _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall
be entitled to injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom, or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware does not have proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court located
in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom, and, in any action
for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. Other than with respect to _Section_ __ _ 8.03_,
which are integral parts of this Agreement, if any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the
parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner, in order that the Merger be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

ARTICLE FOURTEEN

 

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director or an officer of the Company or, while a director or officer of the
Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent permitted
by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits
the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted
the Company to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA
excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred
or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however,
that, except as provided in Article fourteen, section (c) with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses
or with respect to any compulsory counterclaim brought by such indemnitee, the
Company shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.

(b) _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Article Fourteen, section (a), an indemnitee
shall also have the right to be paid by the Company the expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in appearing at, participating in or defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition or in connection with a
proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Article Fourteen (which shall be governed
by Article 14, section (c) (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses");
provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires or in the case of an advance
made in a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or  advancement, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or
her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made solely upon delivery to the
Company of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of
such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified or entitled to advancement of expenses under
Article Fourteen sections (a) and (b) or otherwise.

(c) _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Article Fourteen
sections (a) or (b) is not paid in full by the Company within (i) 60 days
after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the Company or
(ii) 20 days after a claim for an advancement of expenses has been
received by the Company, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or to obtain
advancement of expenses, as applicable. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought
by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms 18
of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it
shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Company to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Company shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication
that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Company
(including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of
such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Company (including its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses
hereunder, or brought by the Company to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Article Fourteen or otherwise shall be on the Company.

(d) _Indemnification Not Exclusive_.

 

(1) The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and
costs to any indemnitee under this Article Fourteen, or the entitlement of
any indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under
this Article Fourteen, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the
Company to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such indemnitee in
any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any
right to which any indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
such indemnitees capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the
Company and as to action in any other capacity. (2) Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined below) may
arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director of the Company at
the request of the indemnitee-related entities (as defined below), the Company
shall be fully and primarily responsible for the payment to the indemnitee in
respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with any
such jointly indemnifiable claims, pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of this Article Fourteen, irrespective of any right of recovery the
indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities. Under no
circumstance shall the Company be entitled to any right of subrogation or
contribution by the indemnitee-related entities and no right of advancement or
recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities
shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the indemnitee or the
obligations of the Company hereunder. In the event that any of the indemnitee-
related entities shall make any payment to the indemnitee in respect of
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly
indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity making such payment shall
be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery
of the indemnitee against the Company, and the indemnitee shall execute all
papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be reasonably
necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as
may be necessary to enable the indemnitee-related entities effectively to
bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the indemnitee-related entities
shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to this section (d)(2) of
Article Fourteen, entitled to enforce this section (d)(2) of Article Fourteen.

 

For purposes of this Section (d)(2) of Article Fourteen, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:

 

The term "indemnitee-related entities" means any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise (other than the Company or any other corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise for which the indemnitee has agreed, on behalf of the
Company or at the Companys request, to serve as a director, officer,
employee or agent and which service is covered by the indemnity described
herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or in part, the
Company may also have an indemnification or advancement obligation.

The term "jointly indemnifiable claims" shall be broadly construed and shall
include, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding for which the
indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
from both the indemnitee-related entities and the Company pursuant to
Delaware law, any agreement or certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
partnership agreement, operating agreement, certificate of formation,
certificate of limited partnership or comparable organizational documents of
the Company or the indemnitee-related entities, as applicable. (e) _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article
Fourteen shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the
benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article Fourteen that adversely
affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only
and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any
proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

(f) _Insurance_. The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the DGCL.

(g) _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Company_. The Company
may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors,
grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any
employee or agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of
this Article Fourteen with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Company.

 

Any reference to an officer of the Company in this Article Fourteen shall be
deemed to refer exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Legal Officer, General
Counsel and Secretary of the Company appointed pursuant to the Companys
bylaws, and to any Vice President, Assistant Secretary, Assistant Treasurer
or other officer of the Company appointed by the Board of Directors pursuant
to the Companys bylaws, and any reference to an officer of any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise shall be deemed to refer exclusively to an officer appointed by
the board of directors or equivalent governing body of such other entity
pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of such other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The fact that any
person who is or was an employee of the Company or an employee of any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise has been given or has used the title of "Vice President"
or any other title that could be construed to suggest or imply that such
person is or may be an officer of the Company or of such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
shall not result in such person being constituted as, or being deemed to be,
an officer of the Company or of such other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for purposes of
this Article Fourteen.

ARTICLE FIFTEEN

 

The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision
contained in this Certificate in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by
law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors and
officers are subject to this reserved power.
