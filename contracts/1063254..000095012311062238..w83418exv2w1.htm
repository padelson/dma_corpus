reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement and may apply standards of materiality in a way that
is different from what may be viewed as material by stockholders of, or other investors in, the

Parent with respect to the Certificate Amendment and the Share Issuance (such proxy statement,
together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, is referred to herein as the <I>&#147;Proxy
Statement&#148;</I>). The Company shall promptly provide to Parent all such information concerning its
business and financial statements and affairs as reasonably may be required or appropriate for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and the Company

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; <I>provided</I>,
<I>however</I>, that no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to information supplied
by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall

connection with the Merger will be securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act by
reason of Section&nbsp;3(a)(10) thereof in reliance on the Court Approval. The parties acknowledge that
the effect of such exemption is that (i)&nbsp;shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement to Persons who are not &#147;affiliates&#148; of Parent or the Company for purposes of Rule&nbsp;145
under the Securities Act are not subject to restrictions on resale arising under U.S. Securities

&#147;affiliates&#148; of Parent or the Company for purposes of Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act may be

foregoing, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, prior to
the first date on which the Information Statement is mailed or otherwise delivered to shareholders
of the Company), Parent shall (x)&nbsp;use reasonable best efforts to cause to be provided to the

not recommend enforcement action in connection with Parent&#146;s reliance on the exemption from
registration under Section&nbsp;3(a)(10) of the Securities Act for the issuance of Parent Common Stock
in connection with the Merger, if either the Company or Parent determines that such &#147;no-action

of any request by any government officials for amendments or supplements to any Other Filing, or
for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between
such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to any Other Filing.

respects with applicable Law, including, as applicable, (i)&nbsp;the Exchange Act, (ii)&nbsp;the Securities
Act, (iii)&nbsp;the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq and the TASE, and (iv)&nbsp;the requirements of the
Israeli Companies Law and the Israeli Securities Law. Whenever any event occurs which is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any such document, the Company or the Parent, as
the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with
any government officials, and/or mailing to the shareholders or, if applicable, creditors, of the
Company, such amendment or supplement. All filings by Parent and by the Company with the SEC or the
ISA in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including any amendments or
supplements thereto, shall be made only upon the receipt of the prior review and approval thereof
by the other party hereto (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

application for an exemption from the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law (1968)&nbsp;concerning
the publication of a prospectus in respect of the exchange of the Company Options for Parent Stock
Options, pursuant to Section&nbsp;15D of the Securities Law of Israel. The Company shall cooperate with

would be relied upon by Parent as an approval of the Merger Proposal for the purpose of qualifying
the issuance of Parent Common Stock hereunder for the Section&nbsp;3(a)(10) exemption from the

the Company will deliver to each of its shareholders and, if required by the Applicable Court,

description of the rights of a shareholder or a creditor, as applicable, to object to the Merger
Proposal, information on the hearing scheduled before the Applicable Court and any position of the
Company&#146;s board of directors with respect to the advisability of the Merger. Parent shall promptly

agree that the Company and Parent have previously executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement, entered into
on or about April&nbsp;12, 2011 (the <I>&#147;Non-Disclosure Agreement&#148;</I>), which Non-Disclosure Agreement will
continue to be in full force and effect in accordance with its terms except as otherwise provided
herein. Each of Parent and the Company will afford the other parties hereto and the other parties&#146;
accountants, counsel and other Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the
Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business as the other may reasonably
request. Each of the parties hereto will hold, and will cause its accountants, counsel and other
Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on
behalf of another party to this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably
disrupt the operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of any agreement to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
(<I>provided </I>that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has used its reasonable best efforts to
find an alternative way to provide the access or information contemplated by this Section&nbsp;6.5),
would be reasonably likely to result in a risk of a loss of attorney-client or other similar
privilege to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or would be reasonably likely to result in a
violation of any applicable Law. No information or knowledge obtained by a party hereto in any
investigation pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.5 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger.

(including to any statute, ordinance, code, rule, regulation, or any provision thereof) shall be
deemed to include reference to such Law and or to such legal requirement, as amended, and any legal
requirements promulgated thereunder or successor thereto. It is understood and agreed that, in the
absence of compelling legal authority to the contrary, the Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company and the Company&#146;s outside legal counsel shall be entitled to rely on and deem applicable to
the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company the Law applicable to corporations
incorporated in Delaware for purposes of making the conclusions contemplated by Section&nbsp;6.6 (and
providing advice with respect thereto) relating to the fiduciary obligations of such Person for
purposes of this Agreement, and that references to the &#147;fiduciary duties&#148; of the Board of Directors
of the Company and other terms of similar import shall, for purposes of this Agreement, include
reference to such Delaware Law. The immediately preceding sentence is intended only to govern the
contractual rights of the parties to this Agreement; it being understood and agreed that nothing in
this Agreement is intended to modify any fiduciary duties of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors under
applicable Law or give rise to any breach or violation of this Agreement on the part of the Company
by reason of the fact that the Board of Directors of the Company has complied with the Law of the
State of Israel, rather than the Delaware Law, governing the duties owed by a director of a company
formed under the Laws of the State of Israel to such company, its shareholders or any other Person.

waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that after

stockholders of Parent, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the
approval of the shareholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
