 _The Merger Agreement has been provided solely to inform investors of its
terms. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger
Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreement and as of
specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a
way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may
have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the
Merger Agreement and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is
different from what may be viewed as material by stockholders of, or other
investors in, the Company. The Company s stockholders and other investors
are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not
rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions
thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates._

PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 2.1 _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub (as the target company ( _Chevrat Yaad_ ) in the Merger) shall be merged with and into the Company (as the absorbing company ( _Chevra Koletet_ ) in the Merger). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation (the _"Surviving Corporation"_ ) and shall (a) become a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of Parent, (b) be governed by the Laws of the State of Israel, (c) maintain a registered office in the State of Israel, and (d) succeed to and assume all of the rights, properties and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law. 

  

 2.2 _Effective Time; Closing Date._ The closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the _"Closing"_ ) shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, at 9:00 a.m. (local time) on the date that is the fifth (5th) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied or waived as of the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), including the receipt of the Court Approval, or at such other time, date or location as the parties hereto shall mutually agree. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the _"Closing Date."_ On or before the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company shall each, in coordination with each other, deliver to the Companies Registrar a notice informing the Companies Registrar that the Merger was approved by the general shareholders meeting of Merger Sub and by the Applicable Court. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar of a certificate evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the _"Effective Time."_  

  

 2.3 _Effects of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Shares._ Each Ordinary Share, NIS 0.01 par value per share, of the Company (collectively, the _"Company Shares"_ ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Company Shares canceled pursuant to Section 2.3(b), shall automatically be converted into and represent the right to receive 2.72 shares (the _"Exchange Ratio"_ ) of Parent Common Stock (the _"Merger Consideration"_ ). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Parent-Owned Stock and Stock Held in Treasury._ Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired without any conversion or consideration paid in respect thereof and shall cease to exist. 

  

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each Ordinary Share, NIS 0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Ordinary Share, NIS 0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration._ The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any forward or reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Shares), stock sale, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) _Fractional Shares._ No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued to represent any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock to be delivered hereunder in exchange for Company Shares, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender by such holder of each Certificate held thereby, receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, _multiplied by_ (ii) the average closing sale price per share of Parent Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on and including the second trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time as reported on Nasdaq. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. 

  

 2.4 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint one or more bank or trust companies maintaining offices in the United States and Israel mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company to act as exchange agent (the _"Exchange Agent"_ ) and shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to be performed by the Exchange Agent. 

         ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration._ At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, the aggregate shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the aggregate Merger Consideration and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(d) (collectively, the _"Exchange Fund"_ ). In the event that the shares and/or cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder (including pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and 2.4(d)), Parent shall promptly make available to the Exchange Agent the amounts so required to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions contemplated to be paid for Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund as contemplated hereby. Except as contemplated by this Section 2.4, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Amounts of cash in the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Shares; and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or America of any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective Time of one or more certificates (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or uncertificated Company Shares (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company Shares that were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.3: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate or the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent), that shall also be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify, (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate or the transfer of Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (iii) a certificate or declaration in customary form to be used to confirm the status of a Person as a Resident of Israel within the meaning of the Ordinance (a " _Residence Certificate_ "). Upon (x) surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(d), and the Certificates so surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered or canceled, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive, upon surrender and without interest, the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.3, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4(d). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificate or untransferred Uncertificated Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Uncertificated Share in accordance with this Section 2.4. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or transfer of any such Uncertificated Share, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the record holder thereof, without interest, whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment of the amount of cash, if any, into which the aggregate number of Company Shares previously represented by such Certificate surrendered or Uncertificated Share transferred shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership._ If shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent to the extent in accordance with customary practice, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration into which the Company Shares represented by such Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.3, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable to the holder thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder thereof pursuant to Section 2.4(d). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration, or other amounts, payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Shares or any other Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any applicable Law (including the Ordinance and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Israeli Income Tax Rulings or any other provision of Israeli Law, statute, regulation, administrative ruling, pronouncement or other authority or judicial opinion, as well as any withholding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder); _provided_ that no withholding under Israeli Tax Law will be made from any consideration payable hereunder to a holder of Company Shares to the extent that such holder has provided Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, prior to the time such payment or delivery is made, with a valid exemption or ruling issued by the Israeli Tax Authority exempting the payment or delivery of the Merger Consideration to the relevant holder of Company Shares or Company Stock Options, or the other amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, from withholding Tax; _provided, further_ , that with respect to any withholding under the Laws of the State of Israel, the Exchange Agent and Parent shall act in accordance with the Israeli Income Tax Rulings, if obtained, _provided_ that in no event shall Parent and/or Exchange Agent be required to deliver consideration deliverable under this Agreement until the cash amount required to be withheld is provided to Parent or the Exchange Agent by the intended recipient (whether in cash or by way of binding written instructions to sell any part of the shares of Parent Common Stock due to such holder and use the proceeds of such sale (net after Tax and transaction costs) to make the withholding of the Tax). To the extent amounts are deducted or withheld pursuant to this Section 2.4(g), such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid and such amounts shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law and notice thereof shall be provided to the applicable holder of Company Shares.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent International Employee Plan_" shall mean each Parent Employee Plan and each government-mandated plan or program that has been adopted or maintained by Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate, whether informally or formally, or with respect to which Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate will or may have any liability, for the benefit of Parent Employees who perform services outside the United States. 

  

 4.14 _ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments; Other Benefits Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) (" _Parent Pension Plans_ "), "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other material Parent Employee Plans (other than standard employment agreements or offer letters entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with employees outside the United States in accordance with local Law and standard severance agreements with employees entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) maintained, or contributed to, by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity that would be treated as a "single employer" with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (" _Parent ERISA Affiliate_ ") for the benefit of any current or former employees, consultants, officers or directors of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries could have any direct or contingent liability. Each Parent Employee Plan has been administered in compliance with its terms and in accordance with all applicable Laws, other than instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. No proceeding has been threatened, asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge of Parent, is anticipated against any of the Parent Employee Plans, any trustee or fiduciaries thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of any of the Parent Employee Plans that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) All Parent Pension Plans (other than a Parent International Employee Plan) have been the subject of determination letters from the IRS to the effect that such Parent Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Parent Pension Plan been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its costs. 

  

 (c) No Parent Pension Plan (other than a Parent International Employee Plan), had, as of the respective last annual valuation date for each such Parent Pension Plan, an "unfunded benefit liability" (as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions that have been furnished to Parent. None of the Parent Pension Plans (other than a Parent International Employee Plan) has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived. None of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Parent Employee Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the Parent Pension Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer or fiduciary of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA. None of such Parent Employee Plans (other than a Parent International Employee Plan) and related trusts has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Parent Employee Plan during the last five years. Neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and 4205 with respect to any Parent Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (other than a Parent International Employee Plan). All premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have been timely paid in full for all Parent Pension Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Parent Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, such plan. 

  

 (d) With respect to any Parent Employee Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan, (i) no such Parent Employee Plan (other than a Parent International Employee Plan) is unfunded or funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code); (ii) each such Parent Employee Plan (other than a Parent International Employee Plan) that is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code; (iii) each such Parent Employee Plan (including any such plan covering retirees or other former employees) may be amended or terminated without material liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time; and (iv) no such Parent Employee Plan (other than a Parent International Employee Plan) provides post-retirement health and welfare benefits to any current or former employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except as required under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other applicable Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (i) the consummation of the Merger alone, or in combination with any other event, will not give rise to any liability under any Parent Employee Plan, including liability for severance pay, unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer, director, independent contractor, stockholder or other service provider of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries and (ii) any amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby by any employee, officer, director or independent contractor of Parent or any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or Parent Employee Plan currently in effect would not be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). 

  

 (f) Each Parent International Employee Plan has been established, maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory or regulatory laws that are applicable to such Parent International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no Parent International Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by law, no condition exists that would prevent Parent from terminating or amending any Parent International Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability to Parent or its Parent ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits). 

  

 (g) Parent has provided or made available to Company correct and complete copies of: (i) all documents embodying each Parent Employee Plan, other than legally-mandated plans, programs and arrangements and each Parent Employment Agreement including all amendments thereto and all related trust documents, administrative service agreements, group annuity contracts, group insurance contracts, and policies pertaining to fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries for each Plan; (ii) the most recent annual actuarial valuations, if any, prepared for each Parent Employee Plan; (iii) the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in connection with each Parent Employee Plan; (iv) if Parent Employee Plan is funded, the most recent annual and periodic accounting of Parent Employee Plan assets; (v) the most recent summary plan description together with the summary(ies) of material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA with respect to each Parent Employee Plan; and (vi) all current IRS determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters, and all applications and correspondence to or from the IRS or the DOL with respect to any such outstanding application.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

  

 6.1 _Proxy Statement; Parent Stockholders Meeting; Other Filings_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting and form of proxy in connection with the vote of the stockholders of Parent with respect to the Certificate Amendment and the Share Issuance (such proxy statement, together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, is referred to herein as the _"Proxy Statement"_ ). The Company shall promptly provide to Parent all such information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as reasonably may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and the Company shall cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with counsel and auditors of Parent in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent shall cause the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall notify the Company promptly upon the receipt of any comments or written communication from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials with respect to, and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing, or for additional information with respect thereto, and shall supply the Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing. Parent shall allow the Company and its Representatives to participate in any meetings, telephone calls or similar communications between Representatives of Parent and the SEC or its staff or any other government officials with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing. Parent shall respond to, and use its reasonable best efforts to address, any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and cause the SEC to confirm that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement as soon as reasonably practicable. 

  

 (b) Parent will, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, duly call, give notice of, and, in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of approving the Certificate Amendment and the Share Issuance. Subject to Section 6.7(e), the Board of Directors of Parent shall cause the Proxy Statement to include the Parent Recommendation. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Certificate Amendment and the Share Issuance. Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting: (i) if and to the extent necessary to provide any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement to Parents stockholders in advance of a vote on the Certificate Amendment and the Share Issuance; or (ii) if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Parent and the Company intend that the Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act by reason of Section 3(a)(10) thereof in reliance on the Court Approval. The parties acknowledge that the effect of such exemption is that (i) shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement to Persons who are not "affiliates" of Parent or the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act are not subject to restrictions on resale arising under U.S. Securities laws and (ii) shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement to Persons who are "affiliates" of Parent or the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act may be resold in reliance upon Rule 144 or Rule 145 under the Securities Act. In connection with the foregoing, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, prior to the first date on which the Information Statement is mailed or otherwise delivered to shareholders of the Company), Parent shall (x) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be provided to the Company a written opinion of its outside legal counsel in Israel in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company that meets the requirements of Section 4.B.4 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Revised Staff Legal Bulletin No. 3, dated October 20, 1999, with respect to the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and (y) apply for and use reasonable best efforts to obtain from the staff of the SEC a "no-action letter" to the effect that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in connection with Parents reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act for the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger, if either the Company or Parent determines that such "no-action letter" is reasonably necessary. 

  

 (d) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall prepare and file any other filings required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or any other federal, non-United States or related Law, or pursuant to the requirements of any stock market or stock exchange, relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Other Filings_ "). Each of the Company and Parent shall notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments or other communication from any government officials and of any request by any government officials for amendments or supplements to any Other Filing, or for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any government officials, on the other hand, with respect to any Other Filing. 

  

 (e) Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity (and all information that it supplies for inclusion in such filing by the other party) to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with applicable Law, including, as applicable, (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act, (iii) the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq and the TASE, and (iv) the requirements of the Israeli Companies Law and the Israeli Securities Law. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any such document, the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with any government officials, and/or mailing to the shareholders or, if applicable, creditors, of the Company, such amendment or supplement. All filings by Parent and by the Company with the SEC or the ISA in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including any amendments or supplements thereto, shall be made only upon the receipt of the prior review and approval thereof by the other party hereto (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 (f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause its Israeli counsel to prepare and file with the Israeli Securities Authority an application for an exemption from the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law (1968) concerning the publication of a prospectus in respect of the exchange of the Company Options for Parent Stock Options, pursuant to Section 15D of the Securities Law of Israel. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in connection with the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain such exemption.

 6.2 _Court Approval._  

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and in accordance with Sections 350 and 351 of the Israeli Companies Law, the Company shall submit to the district court of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (the " _Applicable Court_ ") a first motion to convene, in the manner set forth in the Israeli Companies Law and the regulations promulgated pursuant to Sections 350 and 351 of the Israeli Companies Law (the " _Arrangement Regulations_ ") and as shall be ordered by the Applicable Court, shareholders and, if required by the Applicable Court, creditors meetings (the " _Company Meetings_ ") for the approval of the terms and conditions of an arrangement between the Company and its shareholders and/or creditors, including this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (the " _Merger Proposal_ ") by a majority in number representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the votes cast in the Company Meetings or as otherwise ordered by the Applicable Court (the " _Section 350 Vote_"). In such motion the Company will inform the Applicable Court that, upon the approval of the Merger Proposal by the requisite majority at the Company Meetings, and subsequently by the Applicable Court, such court approval would be relied upon by Parent as an approval of the Merger Proposal for the purpose of qualifying the issuance of Parent Common Stock hereunder for the Section 3(a)(10) exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. As part of the notice of the Company Meetings, the Company will deliver to each of its shareholders and, if required by the Applicable Court, creditors, a notice of the meetings, the order of the court to convene the meetings, the application for the approval of the proposed Merger Proposal submitted to the court, a power of attorney to attend the meetings in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law and a proxy card for the vote (collectively, the " _Information Statement_ "). The Information Statement will include a description of the rights of a shareholder or a creditor, as applicable, to object to the Merger Proposal, information on the hearing scheduled before the Applicable Court and any position of the Companys board of directors with respect to the advisability of the Merger. Parent shall promptly provide to the Company all such information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as reasonably may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Information Statement or any other motions in connection with the receipt of the Court Approval, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and Parent shall cause its (and Merger Subs) counsel and auditors to cooperate with counsel and auditors of the Company in the preparation of the Information Statement. Following the approval of the Merger Proposal by the shareholders and, if applicable, the creditors as set forth above, the Company will submit to the Applicable Court a second motion for (i) the approval of the arrangement and the Merger Proposal and the order of all actions to be taken in accordance with the Merger Proposal; and (ii) to hold a hearing on the fairness of the Merger Proposal regardless of whether or not any objections to the Merger Proposal are raised (these approvals when obtained shall be collectively referred to as the " _Court Approval_ "). 

  

 (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of the Merger Proposal and all documents filed with respect to the Court Approval. In addition, each of the Company and Parent shall at all times comply with all the procedures detailed in the Israeli Companies Law and the Arrangement Regulations and shall make all necessary actions in order to minimize the term of such procedures. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Subject to Section 6.6, the Board of Directors of the Company shall cause the Company Disclosure Documents to include the Company Recommendation.

The Company shall call, notice, convene, hold, conduct and solicit all proxies in connection with the Company Meetings in compliance with all applicable Law, including the Israeli Companies Law, the Company Charter Documents, and the rules of Nasdaq and TASE, as applicable. The Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meetings: (i) if and to the extent necessary to provide any necessary supplement or amendment to the Company Disclosure Documents to the Companys shareholders or, if applicable, creditors, in advance of a vote on the Merger Proposal; or (ii) if, as of the time for which the Company Meetings are originally scheduled (as set forth in the Company Disclosure Documents), there are insufficient Company Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meetings; or (iii) pursuant to the order or stipulation of the Applicable Court or as a result of an order or stipulation of the Applicable Court that requires a vote of a class of shareholders other than the holders of Company Shares or a class of creditors other than the classes contemplated by the Company in the Merger Proposal. 

  

 6.3 _Notification_. Each of Parent and the Company shall give prompt written notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not being able to be satisfied prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall not, and shall not be deemed to, cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter at or prior to the date of this Agreement or affect any of the conditions set forth in Article VII or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available. 

  

 6.4 _Israeli Approvals_. 

  

 (a) _Government Filings._ Without derogating from the foregoing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver and file, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each notice, report or other document required to be delivered by such party to or filed by such party with any Israeli Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger.

Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its respective Israeli counsel to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Income Tax Rulings. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to obtain the Israeli Income Tax Rulings as promptly as practicable. The Company shall be permitted to comply with any conditions contained in the rulings described in this Section 6.4(b) or, with Parents consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), requests made by the Israeli Tax Manager in connection with its delivery of such rulings.

Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and policies of Nasdaq and the TASE to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares from Nasdaq and the TASE and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange Act effective as of the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) _Section 102 Securities Tax Ruling. _As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and file with the Israeli Tax Authority an application in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub for a ruling providing, among other things, that the conversion of Company Stock and Company Stock Options issued under Section 102(b) of the Ordinance (the " _Company 102 Securities_ ") into Parent Common Stock and Parent Stock Options, as applicable, prior to the lapse of the minimum holding period required under Section 102(b) of the Ordinance (the " _102 Holding Period_ "), will not be treated as a breach of the provisions of Section 102(b) of Ordinance, _provided_ that the applicable consideration deliverable to holders of said Company 102 Securities would be deposited for the duration of the 102 Holding Period with a trustee in accordance with said Section 102 (a " _Section 102 Ruling_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Companys and Parents consent to the Section 102 Ruling shall be required, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by either the Company or Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) In the event that the Israeli Income Tax Rulings and/or the Section 102 Ruling shall require the affirmative consent of any holder or former holder of Company Shares or Company Stock Options in order for such ruling to apply to such Person, then such consent shall be deemed to have been granted unless (i) the Israeli Income Tax Rulings and/or the Section 102 Ruling, as applicable, require otherwise, (ii) with respect to the Israeli Income Tax Rulings, (x) such holder explicitly denied such consent in the letter of transmittal submitted by such holder or (y) such holder signed and delivered a Residence Certificate together with the letter of transmittal or (iii) with respect to the Section 102 Ruling, such holder otherwise explicitly denied such consent in writing, by a letter submitted to the Company before the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Exchange Agent and/or Parent, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonably efforts to accept any Residence Certificate (or such other certificate or declaration in substantially similar form) received separately from a letter of transmittal and confirm in writing receipt thereof to the sender thereof. Unless the Israeli Income Tax Rulings requires otherwise, such deemed consent to the Israeli Tax Rulings shall be also deemed a request to join the arrangement under such ruling, to defer the Tax in accordance with, and subject to, Section 104H of the Ordinance. 

  

 6.5 _Confidentiality; Access to Information._ The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Company and Parent have previously executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement, entered into on or about April 12, 2011 (the _"Non-Disclosure Agreement"_ ), which Non-Disclosure Agreement will continue to be in full force and effect in accordance with its terms except as otherwise provided herein. Each of Parent and the Company will afford the other parties hereto and the other parties accountants, counsel and other Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to its properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business as the other may reasonably request. Each of the parties hereto will hold, and will cause its accountants, counsel and other Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of another party to this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of any agreement to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party ( _provided_ that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has used its reasonable best efforts to find an alternative way to provide the access or information contemplated by this Section 6.5), would be reasonably likely to result in a risk of a loss of attorney-client or other similar privilege to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of any applicable Law. No information or knowledge obtained by a party hereto in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.5 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

Each of the Company and its Board of Directors and Parent and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the acquisition of shares of Parent Common Stock), use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable and such shares may be held on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the ownership of such shares without limitation, including following the Effective Time). 

  

 6.11 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all current and former directors, officers and employees, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) in their capacities as such. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former directors, officers and employees, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof, in each case to the maximum extent permitted by Law, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provision in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of such indemnitee thereunder for any acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will endeavor to enter into a directors and officers liability insurance policy covering those Persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (the _"Insured Parties"_ ) on terms no less favorable to the Insured Parties than those of the Companys present directors and officers liability insurance policy (such policy, a  _"Company D andO Policy"_), for a period of seven years after the Effective Time. If the Company is unable to obtain such a Company DandO Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for a period of seven years after the Closing Date, a Company DandO Policy with a creditworthy issuer; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend annually more than 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (the approximate amount of which is set forth on Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) and, if the cost for such coverage is in excess of such amount, Parent shall be required only to maintain the maximum amount of coverage as is reasonably available for 250% of such annual premium. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11. 

  

 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee and/or Insured Party to whom this Section 6.11 applies without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee and Insured Party. It is expressly agreed that the indemnitees and/or Insured Parties to whom this Section 6.11 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11. 

  

 (e) Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained herein without limit as to time. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any indemnitee and/or Insured Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided hereunder or other applicable indemnification obligation referenced to herein. The rights of each indemnitee and/or Insured Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Person may have under the Company Charter Documents or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, or any other indemnification arrangement or otherwise. 

  

 6.12 _Nasdaq Listing._ Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing upon the Effective Time on Nasdaq or on such other national securities exchange as the Parent Common Stock is listed. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the ticker symbol for shares of Parent Common Stock listed on Nasdaq or such other exchange to be "FNDT" upon the Effective Time. 

  

 6.13 _Employee Matters._  

  

 (a) It is Parents and the Companys intention that, for a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, individuals who are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and that continue to be employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, following the Effective Time (each, a " _Post-Merger Employee_ ") and individuals who are employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and that continue to be employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time shall be provided with salaries and benefits that are in the aggregate approximately equal to the salaries and benefits (other than equity compensation) they received prior to the Effective Time, it being understood that Parent shall review the salaries and benefits of its and its Subsidiaries employees from time to time in order to determine the most appropriate way to compensate and incentivize Post-Merger Employees, and accordingly may make such changes in the compensation and benefits that Parent determines to be in the best interests of Parent from time to time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) It is Parents and the Companys intention that, each Post-Merger Employee shall be given credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their Subsidiaries, including any such plans providing vacation, sick pay, severance and retirement benefits maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which such Post-Merger Employees participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits), to the extent past service was recognized for such Post-Merger Employees under the comparable Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.13 shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits or (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan. 

  

 (c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Post-Merger Employees following the Effective Time, it is Parents and the Companys intention that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Post-Merger Employees (and their eligible dependents) under any welfare benefit plans in which Post-Merger Employees participate following the Effective Time, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would not apply in the absence of such change, and (ii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Post-Merger Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change. 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.13, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or any legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.13, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that Parent may establish or maintain. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.13, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be treated as an amendment to any Company Employee Plan or creation of an employee benefit plan. 

  

 6.14 _Section 16 Matters. _Parent and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain the Company Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the conversion of Shares into shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the Company Insiders be exempted from liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.14. Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Parent, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company Shares pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. For the purposes of this Agreement, _"Section 16 Information" _shall mean information that is accurate in all material respects and provides reasonably specific details regarding the identity of the Company Insiders and the number of Company Shares held by each such Company Insider to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in the Merger; and _"Company Insiders"_ shall mean those officers and directors of the Company who may be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on or following the Effective Time and who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each party hereto shall promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any litigation commenced or threatened in writing to be commenced by any stockholder of such party against such party and/or any of its directors relating to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall keep the other party fully informed regarding any such litigation. Each party shall give the other the opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, the defense or settlement of any such litigation, shall give due consideration to the others advice with respect to such litigation and shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 6.16 _Transition Committee_. Promptly after the date hereof, Parent and the Company will establish a transition committee (the " _Transition Committee_ "), the co-chairs of which will be (i) Parents Chief Financial Officer or such other Person designated by Parents Chief Executive Officer and (ii) the Companys Chief Operating Officer or such other Person designated by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the " _Transition Co-Chairpersons_ "), and the other members of which shall consist of three other representatives of Parent and three other representatives of the Company, or such number as the Chief Executive Officers of Parent and the Company agree, designated by the Transition Co-Chairpersons and approved by the Chief Executive Officer (or his designee) of each of Parent and the Company. The parties shall instruct the Transition Committee, subject to the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement and applicable Laws, to facilitate the collection and exchange of information concerning the business, operations, capital spending and budgets and financial results of Parent and the Company to the extent necessary to identify ways in which the operations of Parent and the Company can be consolidated, coordinated and/or otherwise enhanced following the Effective Time, shall cooperate in good faith on identifying any recommendations therefor and shall undertake such other tasks as jointly delegated to it by the Chief Executive Officers of the Company and Parent. The Transition Committee shall present its findings from time to time to the management of the Company and Parent. 

  

 6.17 _Registration Rights Agreements_. Upon the written request of any Significant Company Shareholder delivered to Parent on or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days following such request) execute and deliver to such Significant Company Shareholder a registration and information rights agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (any such agreement, a " _Registration Rights Agreement_ ").

Each party hereto agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if any party fails promptly to pay any amounts due under this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the party failing to pay for such amounts, then the party failing to pay such amounts shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such amounts was due to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of the Bank of New York in effect on the date such payment was due, together with the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the party seeking collection (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

 9.3 _Construction_. For the purposes of this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or unless the context otherwise requires: (i) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, and the use of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the other genders; (ii) references herein to "Articles," "Sections," "subsections" and other subdivisions, without reference to a document are to the specified Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement; (iii) a reference to a subsection or other subdivision without further reference to a Section is a reference to such subsection or subdivision as contained in the same Section in which the reference appears; (iv) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," "hereby" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision; (v) the words "include," "includes" and "including" are deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation"; (vi) all accounting terms used and not expressly defined herein have the respective meanings given to them under GAAP, as applicable; and (vii) any reference herein to any Law or legal requirement (including to any statute, ordinance, code, rule, regulation, or any provision thereof) shall be deemed to include reference to such Law and or to such legal requirement, as amended, and any legal requirements promulgated thereunder or successor thereto. It is understood and agreed that, in the absence of compelling legal authority to the contrary, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the Companys outside legal counsel shall be entitled to rely on and deem applicable to the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company the Law applicable to corporations incorporated in Delaware for purposes of making the conclusions contemplated by Section 6.6 (and providing advice with respect thereto) relating to the fiduciary obligations of such Person for purposes of this Agreement, and that references to the "fiduciary duties" of the Board of Directors of the Company and other terms of similar import shall, for purposes of this Agreement, include reference to such Delaware Law. The immediately preceding sentence is intended only to govern the contractual rights of the parties to this Agreement; it being understood and agreed that nothing in this Agreement is intended to modify any fiduciary duties of the Companys Board of Directors under applicable Law or give rise to any breach or violation of this Agreement on the part of the Company by reason of the fact that the Board of Directors of the Company has complied with the Law of the State of Israel, rather than the Delaware Law, governing the duties owed by a director of a company formed under the Laws of the State of Israel to such company, its shareholders or any other Person. 

  

 9.4 _Headings; Table of Contents_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 9.5 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto agree that they have jointly drafted and have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.6 _Disclosure Schedules_. All capitalized terms not defined in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. Each representation and warranty of a party in this Agreement is made and given, and the covenants are agreed to, subject to the disclosures and exceptions set forth on such partys Disclosure Schedule. The disclosure of any matter in any section of a partys Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure by such party for all purposes of this Agreement and all other sections of such partys Disclosure Schedule to which such disclosure reasonably would be inferred. The listing of any matter on a partys Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by such party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed by such party under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in a partys Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation by such party of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in a partys Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of such partys representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 9.7 _Counterparts; Facsimile and Electronic Signatures._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by portable document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original. 

  

 9.8 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) except (i) the third party beneficiaries contemplated by Section 6.11, (ii) the right of the Company, on behalf of its shareholders, to pursue damages (including damages for the loss of economic benefits) on their behalf in the event of Parents breach of this Agreement, (iii) from and after the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company Shares and Company Stock Options to receive the applicable Merger Consideration or other consideration to be paid hereunder as set forth in Article II, and (iv) the rights of any Significant Company Shareholder, who shall be third-party beneficiaries of Section 6.17, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 9.9 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of Court Approval, an affirmative Section 350 Vote or the Parent Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or TASE require further approval of the shareholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.10 _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by such provision or its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such provision as may be possible. 

  

 9.11 _Remedies; Specific Performance._ Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto (on behalf of itself or third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, including the Companys shareholders) will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court having jurisdiction related to this Agreement as provided in Section 9.14 without the necessity of demonstrating damages or posting a bond, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 9.12 _Assignment._ No party hereto may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 9.13 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction; _provided, however_ , that any matter involving the internal corporate affairs of the Company or any party hereto shall be governed by the provisions of the jurisdictions of its incorporation. The rights of the shareholders of the Company and the provision of this Agreement that relate to the Court Approval and the Merger that are required under Laws of the State of Israel to be governed by the Laws of the State of Israel shall be governed by the Laws of the State of Israel. 

   ##### 

  

  

 9.14 _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS._ EACH PARTY HERETO CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY MAY BE LITIGATED ONLY IN SUCH COURTS. EACH PARTY HERETO ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS RESPECTIVE PROPERTIES, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE FIFTEEN (15) CALENDAR DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL IN ANY WAY BE DEEMED TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF EITHER PARTY HERETO TO SERVE ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE ABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TO APPLY TO ISRAELI COURTS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS OF 1958 OR OTHERWISE. 

  

 9.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Parent shall take all necessary action, including by resolution of the Board
of Directors, to amend or adopt, as applicable, effective as of the Effective
Time, its Corporate Governance Guidelines, governance principles or other
similar instrument or delegation of authority, to set out the roles, duties
and responsibilities of the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and

It is the intention of these guidelines that the Executive Chairman of the
Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer shall work together in a
cooperative manner to formulate and further the strategic, financial and
managerial direction of Parent, subject at all time to the oversight and
approval of the Parent Board of Directors. In furtherance of this policy,
unless authorized by the Parent Board of Directors in advance, none of the
Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or any other officer of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (in his or her capacity as an officer of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries) shall take any action (other than discussing or otherwise
presenting a proposal for any such action to the Parent Board of Directors)
on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries in furtherance of any of the items
described below without the prior authorization or consent of each of the
Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer: 

   

       |   | issuance of any equity interests of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or any securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible
into equity interests of Parent or its Subsidiaries, other than: (i) in the
case of Subsidiaries, to Parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent of
stock or other equity interests in a Subsidiary of Parent; (ii) of equity
compensation awards as determined by the Board of Directors of Parent; and
(iii) of securities upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any then-
outstanding derivative security;  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | incurrence of any indebtedness for borrowed money, other
than indebtedness (i) outstanding as of the Closing Date; or (ii) incurred
in the ordinary course of business;  
      
    |   | engaging in any merger, consolidation or other
business combination transactions or recapitalization or reorganization;  
      
    |   | acquisition of any enterprise or business (whether by
merger, stock or assets) or other significant assets outside of the ordinary
course of business;  
      
    |   | sale or other disposition of any assets of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course of business;  
      
    |   | acquisition or development of any material new product or
service offering;  
         

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | engaging in any line of business substantially different
from those lines of business conducted by Parent and its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing Date;  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | hiring or termination of the executive chairman, chief
executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer,
chief legal officer and each Person (including any consultant or
other Person, even if not technically an employee) performing the functions
of any such office (each a " _Senior Officer_ ") or any Person who directly
reports (including any consultant or other Person, even if not technically an
employee) to any Senior Officer (together with the Senior Officers, each an "
_Applicable Employee_ ");  
      
    |   | modification of the salary or other compensation of any
Applicable Employee, materially changing the responsibilities of
any Applicable Employee, or making any material changes to the employment
agreement of any Applicable Employee;  
      
    |   | approval of (i) any operating or capital expenditure budget
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any material amendment or
supplement to or other modification thereof;  
      
    |   | institution, settlement, withdrawal or compromise of any
material lawsuit, claim, counterclaim or other legal proceeding by
or against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any of their
respective material properties or assets; or  
      
    |   | delegate any authority to take any of the foregoing actions to
any other officer or employee.  
   

 

None of the foregoing principles is intended to limit in any way any rights or
obligations of the Parent Board of Directors, including any right of the
Parent Board of Directors to take any action without the consent of any
officer. If any provision of these principles is held to be illegal, invalid
or unenforceable under any present or future law or the certificate of
incorporation or any by-law of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (a) such provision
will be fully severable, (b) these principles will be construed and enforced
as if such provision had never comprised a part hereof and (c) the remaining
provisions of these principles will remain in full force and effect and
will not be affected by such provision or its severance herefrom. 

  

The Parent Board of Directors may only change any of these principles by an
action of a majority of all members of the Parent Board of Directors.

3\. _Demand Registration_. 

   

 (a) Provided that the Company does not have the Registration Statement filed pursuant to _Section 2_ effective and usable to such Holder or group of Holders requesting a Demand Registration under this _Section 3_, any Holder or group of Holders holding, in the aggregate, thirty-five percent (35%) or more of the Registrable Securities then issued and outstanding (the " _Outstanding Amount_ ") shall have the right, by written notice given to the Company (a " _Demand Notice_ "), to request the Company to register under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act all or any portion of the Registrable Securities designated by such Holder(s); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Registrable Securities requested to be registered constitute at least thirty-five percent (35%) of the Outstanding Amount. Each request for a Demand Registration shall be in writing and shall specify the approximate aggregate number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered (which aggregate number of Registrable Securities must either (i) have a value equal to at least $15,000,000 based on the closing price of such securities on the last trading day prior to the date of such request or, in the case no closing price is available, at the anticipated price offered to the public or (ii) equal the total number of Registrable Securities held by a Holders with respect to any Holder. In no event shall the Company be obligated to effectuate more than two (2) Demand Registrations in any 12-month period. A registration shall not count as a Demand Registration until it has become effective. In no event shall Shelf Registrations (and any other filing made pursuant to _Section 2_ hereof) or Shelf Takedowns be deemed to constitute Demand Registrations. 

  

 (b) Upon receipt of a Demand Notice, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of such Demand Notice), notify all other Holders, if any, of the receipt of such Demand Notice and allow them the opportunity to include Registrable Securities held by them in the proposed registration by submitting their own Demand Notice. In connection with any Demand Registration in which more than one Holder participates, in the event that such Demand Registration, including any Shelf Takedown thereunder, involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters participating in such offering advise in writing the Holders of Registrable Securities to be included in such offering that the total number of Registrable Securities to be included in such offering exceeds the amount that can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without delaying or jeopardizing the success of such offering (including the price per share of the Registrable Securities to be sold), then the Registrable Securities to be offered shall be distributed amongst the participating Holders according to each Holders overall percentage of ownership in the Company. In the event of such a pro-rata distribution, to the extent that any Holder (or Holders) has not submitted a Demand Notice, or withdraws from the underwriting, then those Shares that would have been allocated  _pro-rata_ to the non-participating Holder if they had participated shall be distributed amongst the participating Holders, _pro rata_ according to each participating Holders overall percentage of ownership in the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Company, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Company receives a Demand Notice given by Holders in accordance with _Section 3(a)_, shall file with the SEC, and the Company shall thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective as promptly as practicable, a Registration Statement on the appropriate form for the registration and sale, in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution, of the total number of Registrable Securities specified by the Holders in such Demand Notice (a " _Demand Registration_ "). Any Demand Registration may, at the request of the Holders submitting the Demand Notice, be a Shelf Registration. 

  

 (d) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to keep each Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 3_ continuously effective and usable for the resale of the Registrable Securities covered thereby (i) in the case of a Registration that is not a Shelf Registration, for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days from the date on which the SEC declares such Registration Statement effective and (ii) in the case of a Shelf Registration, for a period of three (3) years from the date on which the SEC declares such Registration Statement effective, in either case (x) until such earlier date as all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such Registration Statement, and (y) as such period may be extended pursuant to this _Section 3_. The time period for which the Company is required to maintain the effectiveness of any Registration Statement shall be extended by the aggregate number of days of all Delay Periods and all Interruption Periods occurring with respect to such Registration and such period and any extension thereof is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effectiveness Period_ ". If any Registrable Securities remain issued and outstanding after thirty (30) full months following the initial effective date of a Shelf Registration filed pursuant to this _Section 3_, upon the request of Holder(s) of at least ten percent (10%) of the Registrable Securities then issued and outstanding, the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of such request, file a new Shelf Registration and shall thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective as promptly as practical, such new Shelf Registration. 

  

 (e) The Company shall be entitled to postpone the filing of any Registration Statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by the Company pursuant to this _Section 3_ , or suspend the use of any effective Registration Statement under this _Section 3_, for a reasonable period of time, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in the Board of Directors reasonable good faith judgment that the registration and distribution of the Registrable Securities covered or to be covered by such Registration Statement would (i) materially interfere with any pending material financing, acquisition, disposition, or corporate reorganization involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) require premature disclosure thereof, or (iii) be seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders, which such determination shall be made by a majority of the members then serving on the Companys Board of Directors, and promptly gives the Holders written notice of such determination, containing a general statement of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the period of the anticipated delay; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that (i) the aggregate number of days included in all delay periods during any consecutive twelve (12) months shall not exceed the aggregate of (x) forty-five (45) days minus (y) the number of days occurring during all Interruption Periods during such consecutive twelve (12) months and (ii) a period of at least ninety (90) days shall elapse between the termination of any delay period or Interruption Period and the commencement of the immediately succeeding delay period. If the Company shall so postpone the filing of a Registration Statement, the Holders of Registrable Securities to be registered shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice from the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities that were to be registered to the Company within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the notice of postponement or, if earlier, the termination of such delay period (and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of determining the number of requests for registration to which the Holders of Registrable Securities are entitled pursuant to this _Section 3_). The Company shall not be entitled to initiate or continue a delay period unless it shall (A) concurrently prohibit sales by all other security holders under registration statements covering securities held by such other security holders and (B) in accordance with the Companys policies from time to time in effect, forbid purchases and sales in the open market by directors and executive officers of the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) The Company shall not include any securities (whether for its own account or otherwise) that are not Registrable Securities in any Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 3_ without the prior written consent of the Holders of a majority in number of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. Any such securities so included shall be subject to the cut-back provisions of _Section 3(a)(ii)_. 

  

 (g) Holders of a majority in number of the Registrable Securities to be included in a Registration Statement pursuant to this _Section 3_ may, at any time prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement relating to such Registration, revoke such request (a _"_ _Demand Request_ _"_ ) by providing a written notice to the Company revoking such request. Any such Demand Request so withdrawn, prior to filing a Registration Statement pursuant to such Demand Request with the SEC, shall not be counted for purposes of determining the number of requests for registration to which the Holders of Registrable Securities are entitled pursuant to this _Section 3_. Any such Demand Request so withdrawn after filing the Registration Statement pursuant to the Demand Request to which such Registration Statement relates with the SEC shall not be counted for purposes of determining the number of requests for registration to which the Holders of Registrable Securities are entitled pursuant to this _Section 3_ if the Holders of Registrable Securities who revoked such request reimburse the Company for all its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the preparation, filing and processing of the Registration Statement; provided, however, that, if such revocation was based on (i) the Companys failure to comply in any material respect with its obligations hereunder or (ii) the institution by the Company of a Delay Period or the occurrence of any Interruption Period, such reimbursement shall not be required. 

 

4\. _Piggyback Registration_. 

   

 (a) _Right to Piggyback_. If at any time the Company proposes to file a registration statement, or effectuate a Shelf Takedown, under the Securities Act with respect to a public offering by the Company for its own account or for the account of any other Person who is a holder of securities of the same type as the Registrable Securities (other than a registration statement (i) on Form S-8 or Form S-4 or any successor forms thereto, or (ii) filed solely in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan or an employee benefit plan), then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the Holders at least fifteen (15) days before the anticipated filing date. Such notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to register such amount of Registrable Securities as they may request (a " _Piggyback Registration_ ") or in the case of a Shelf Takedown, participate in such Shelf Takedown. Subject to _Section 4(b)_, the Company shall include in each such Piggyback Registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten (10) days after notice has been given to the Holders. Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or any portion of the Registrable Securities of such Holder from a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effective date of such Piggyback Registration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Priority on Piggyback Registrations_. The Company shall permit the Holders to include all such Registrable Securities on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities, if any, of the Company or any other persons included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company or the managing underwriter or underwriters participating in such offering advise the Holders in writing that the total amount of securities requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration exceeds the amount which can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering without delaying or jeopardizing the success of the offering (including the price per share of the securities to be sold), then the amount of securities to be offered for the account of the Holders and other holders of securities who have piggyback registration rights with respect thereto shall be reduced (to zero if necessary) _pro rata_ on the basis of the number of Common Stock equivalents requested to be registered by each such Holder or other holder participating in such offering. 

  

 (c) _Right To Abandon_. Nothing in this _Section 4_ shall create any liability on the part of the Company to the Holders if the Company in its sole discretion should decide not to file a registration statement proposed to be filed pursuant to _Section 4(a)_ or to withdraw such registration statement subsequent to its filing, regardless of any action whatsoever that a Holder may have taken, whether as a result of the issuance by the Company of any notice hereunder or otherwise. Any such determination not to file or to withdraw a registration statement shall not affect the obligations of the Company to pay or to reimburse all Registration Expenses pursuant to _Section 6_. 

  

 (d) _Shelf Takedown_. The provisions of this _Section 4_ shall apply equally with respect to any Shelf Takedown, including, without limitation the priority provisions of _Section_ _4(b)_ by the Company or such other Person. 

 

5\. _Registration Procedures_. In connection with the registration obligations
of the Company pursuant to and in accordance with _Sections 2_, _3_ and _4_
(and subject to _Sections 2_, _3_ and _4_ ), the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods
of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall as
expeditiously as possible: 

   

 (a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement for the sale of the Registrable Securities on any form for which the Company then qualifies or which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate in accordance with such Holders intended method or methods of distribution thereof and include in such Registration Statement a plan of distribution reflecting such intended method or methods of distribution, and, subject to the Companys right to terminate or abandon a registration pursuant to _Section 4(c)_, use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) to such Registration Statement, and such supplements to the related Prospectus, as may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable under the Securities Act during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition specified by the Holders of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement, make generally available earnings statements satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act ( _provided_ that the Company shall be deemed to have complied with this Section if it has complied with Rule 158 under the Securities Act), and cause the related Prospectus as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ _,_ that before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto (other than reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus except to the extent that such reports related primarily to the offering), the Company shall furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement and their counsel for review and comment, copies of all documents required to be filed; 

  

 (c) notify the Holders of any Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement promptly and (if requested) confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or for additional information regarding the Company or the Holders, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, and (v) of the happening of any event that requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference so that they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; 

  

 (d) use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the qualification or exemption from qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction in the United States, and to obtain the lifting or withdrawal of any such order at the earliest practicable time; 

  

 (e) furnish to the Holder such number of copies of the preliminary prospectus, any amended preliminary prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus, each final Prospectus and any post-effective amendment or supplement thereto, as such Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities of such Holder covered by such Registration Statement in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall reasonably request in writing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall in no event be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in any jurisdiction where it is not at the time required to be so qualified or to execute or file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction where it has not theretofore done so or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then subject; 

  

 (g) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by _Section 5(c)(v)_, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder (including upon the termination of any Delay Period), such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 

  

 (h) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange or automated interdealer quotation system, if any, on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed or quoted, or, if none, on such securities exchange or automated interdealer quotation system reasonably selected by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding; 

  

 (i) if such offering is an underwritten offering, make available for inspection by any Holder of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement, any underwriter participating in any offering pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such Holder or underwriter (collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "), all financial and other records and other information, pertinent corporate documents and properties of any of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the " _Records_ "), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibilities;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Records that the Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies the Inspectors in writing are confidential shall not be disclosed to any Inspector unless such Inspector signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which shall permit the disclosure of such Records in such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus if (i) necessary to avoid or correct a material misstatement in or material omission from such Registration Statement or Prospectus, (ii) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction, or (iii) such information otherwise becomes publicly available; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that (A) any decision regarding the disclosure of information pursuant to subsection (i) shall be made only after consultation with counsel for the applicable Inspectors and the Company and (B) with respect to any release of Records pursuant to subsection (ii), each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that it shall, promptly after learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court having jurisdiction, give notice to the Company so that the Company, at the Companys expense, may undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of such Records; 

  

 (j) not later than the effective date of a Registration Statement, if a CUSIP number is not available for the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall provide to the Holders the CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (k) in connection with any underwritten offering, whether a Shelf Takedown or otherwise, if requested by the underwriters, the Company shall not effect any public sale or distribution of its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities (except pursuant to registrations on Form S-8 or Form S-4 under the Securities Act), during the ten (10) days prior to and the 90-day period beginning on, or such shorter period agreed to by the underwriters, the date of pricing of such Shelf Takedown, subject to customary extensions thereof to permit the publication of research under FINRA rules and the Company shall execute one or more agreements with the applicable underwriters reflecting this agreement; and 

  

 (l) if such offering is an underwritten offering, enter into such agreements (including an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings) and take all such other appropriate and reasonable actions requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold in connection therewith (including those reasonably requested by the managing underwriters) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in such connection, (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriters and the Holders, addressed to each of the underwriters and the Holders as to the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the Holders and the underwriters, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to each selling Holder of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement (unless such accountants shall be prohibited from so addressing such letters by applicable standards of the accounting profession) and each of the underwriters, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings, (iii) if requested and if an underwriting agreement is entered into, provide indemnification provisions and procedures customary for underwritten public offerings, but in any event no less favorable to the indemnified parties than the provisions set forth in _Section 8_, and (iv) provide for the reasonable participation and cooperation by the management of the Company with respect thereto, including participation by management in road shows, investor meetings and other customary cooperation. The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting or similar agreement, or as and to the extent required thereunder. 

  

 The Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to furnish such information regarding such Holder and such Holders intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities as it may from time to time reasonably request in writing. If any such information is not furnished within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such request, the Company may exclude such Holders Registrable Securities from such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Holder be required to provide any information about its investors unless required by the SEC to do so. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in  _Section 5(c)(ii)_, _5(c)(iii)_ , _5(c)(iv)_ or _5(c)(v)_ , that such Holder shall discontinue disposition of any Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus until receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by _Section 5(g)_, or until such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amended or supplemented Prospectus or any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference in such Prospectus (such period during which disposition is discontinued being an " _Interruption Period_ ") and, if requested by the Company, the Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the expense of the Company) all copies then in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such holders possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such request.

7\. _Underwriting Requirements._  

   

 (a) Subject to _Section 7(c)_, any Holder shall have the right, by written notice, to request that any Demand Registration provide for an underwritten offering, provided that (i) the aggregate amount of underwritten offerings in connection with a Demand Registration, whether pursuant to a Shelf Takedown or otherwise that may be requested hereunder shall be limited to six (6) consummated underwritten offerings; (ii) a request for an underwritten offering shall reasonably be expected to result in gross proceeds, before underwriter discounts or commissions, of $15 million, unless the requesting Holder is selling all of its remaining Registrable Securities, and (iii) no more than three (3) underwritten offerings may be requested in any consecutive twelve (12) months. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In the case of any underwritten offering pursuant to a registration pursuant to _Section 2_ or a Demand Registration, the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be disposed of in connection therewith shall select the institution or institutions that shall manage or lead such offering, which institution or institutions shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company. In the case of any underwritten offering pursuant to a Piggyback Registration, the Company shall select the institution or institutions that shall manage or lead such offering. 

  

 (c) In the case of any Piggyback Registration that is an underwritten offering, no Holder shall be entitled to participate in an underwritten offering unless and until such Holder has entered into an underwriting or other agreement with such institution or institutions for such offering reasonably requested by them; _provided_ , that no holder of Registrable Securities included in any underwritten registration shall be required to make any representation or warranties to the Company or the underwriters (other than representations and warranties regarding such holder and such holders ownership of the shares to be sold free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances pursuant to such underwriting, such holders power and authority to effect such sale, such holders stabilization activities, and with respect to information provided in writing by such holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement) or to undertake any indemnification or contribution obligations to the Company or any underwriter with respect thereto, other than as specifically provided in _Section 8_. 

  

 (d) If Registrable Securities are to be sold in a underwritten offering, the Company agrees to include in the registration statement, or in the case of a Shelf Registration, a prospectus supplement, to be used all such information as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters for the marketing and sale of such Registrable Securities. 

 

8\. _Indemnification; Liquidated Damages_  

   

 (a) _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company shall, without limitation as to time, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable Securities whose Registrable Securities are covered by a Registration Statement or Prospectus, the officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents and employees of each of them, each Person who controls each such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, agents and employees of each such controlling person, to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgment, costs (including costs of investigation or preparation and reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as incurred, arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Registration Statement, any preliminary or final prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto (including, but not limited to, any Free Writing Prospectus), or any other material information provided in writing to the investors by, or with the express approval of, the Company expressly for use in the road show (collectively, " _Marketing Materials_ "), or (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as any such Losses described in clauses (i) or (ii) are based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in the Marketing Materials; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the Company shall not be liable to any such Holder to the extent that any such Losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any preliminary prospectus if (A) having previously been furnished by or on behalf of the Company with copies of the Prospectus, such Holder failed to send or deliver a copy of the Prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities by such Holder to the person asserting the claim from which such Losses arise and (B) the Prospectus would have corrected in all material respects such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or such omission or alleged omission. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Indemnification by Holder of Registrable Securities_ _._ In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with the Marketing Materials and agrees to indemnify, severally and not jointly with the other Holders and to the full extent permitted by law, the Company, its officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, agents and employees of each such controlling person, from and against all Losses arising out of or based upon (x) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Marketing Materials or (y) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is based upon and is consistent with information so furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Holder to the Company expressly for use in such Marketing Materials. No Holder shall be held liable for any damages in excess of the total amount of proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold by such Holder (net of all underwriting discounts and commissions) under that particular Registration Statement. 

  

 (c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. If any Person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), such Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice to the party from which such indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of any claim or of the commencement of any proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the delay or failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation or liability except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by giving written notice to an Indemnified Party promptly after the receipt of written notice from such Indemnified Party of such claim or proceeding, to assume, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, the defense of any such claim or proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) an Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying Party fails promptly to assume the defense of such claim or proceeding or fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party; or (3) the named parties to any proceeding (including impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are in addition to or are inconsistent with those available to the Indemnifying Party or that a conflict of interest is likely to exist among such Indemnified Party and any other indemnified parties (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party); and (ii) subject to subsection (3) above, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all of the indemnified parties. Whether or not such defense is assumed by the Indemnifying Party, such Indemnified Party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this  _Section 8_ is applicable in accordance with its terms but is legally unavailable to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses, then each applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and such Indemnified Party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 8(d)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 8(d)_ , an Indemnifying Party that is a Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount which is in excess of the amount by which the total proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold by such Holder (net of all underwriting discounts and commissions) exceeds the amount of any damages that such Indemnifying Party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

   ##### 

  

 

9\. _Rule 144 Information_. With a view to making available the benefits of
certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the
sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the
Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to: 

   

 (a) Make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times. 

  

 (b) Use its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time it is subject to such reporting requirements). 

  

 (c) Furnish to any Holder forthwith upon request a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents of the Company and other information as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without registration. 

 

10\. _Information Rights_  

   

 (a) The Company will furnish to the Holders (so long as the Holder holds Securities representing at least a Voting Power Percentage Interest of at least ten percent (10%) (such percentage, the " _Information Rights Minimum Securities Percentage"_ and such Holder, a " _Qualified Holder_ ")) all information ( _"Required Information"_ ) such Holder reasonably determines in good faith is required by such Holder or any of its Affiliates for any such Person to comply with any applicable law, including the rules of the SEC or the equivalent governmental entity in any other country, or any rules or listing agreement of any securities exchange on which securities of such Holder or any of its Affiliates may be listed or traded, including any information that is required to be filed with the SEC or the equivalent governmental entity in any other country.
