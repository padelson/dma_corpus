AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of October 6, 2009 by and among Compuware Corporation, a Michigan
corporation ("Parent"), Compuware Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Gomez, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, with respect to Section 7.7,
Richard J. Brekka, Jaime W. Ellertson and Thomas A.F. Krueger, as members of
the Securityholder Committee. Certain capitalized terms used herein are
defined in Section 9.1.

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

A. The Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
believe it is in the best interests of its corporation and its respective
stockholders that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the Merger.

 



 

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration
set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

C. A portion of the consideration otherwise payable by Parent in connection
with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent as security for certain
obligations set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

D. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Merger.

 



 

E. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
each Key Employee has entered into a confidentiality, non-competition, non-
solicitation and development agreement to be effective at the Effective Time.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and
other premises set forth in this Agreement, the mutual benefits to be gained
by the performance of such agreements, covenants and other premises, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are acknowledged and accepted, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease,
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger is
sometimes referred to hereinafter as the "Surviving Corporation."


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

1.2 Effective Time. Unless another time and place is mutually agreed upon
in writing by Parent and the Company, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at the offices of Dykema Gossett PLLC, 400
Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan, within two Business Days after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in Article V.
The date upon which the Closing occurs shall be referred to herein as the
"Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, with the Delaware
Secretary of State (the "Certificate of Merger"), in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such filing with the
Delaware Secretary of State shall be referred to herein as the
"Effective Time").

 



 

1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of
incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read substantially as follows (or
such other name as determined by Parent in its sole discretion): "The name of
the corporation is Gomez, Inc."

 



 

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 



 

1.5 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. Unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time, each to hold the office of a director or officer of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of
Delaware Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as applicable.

1.6 Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent
Corporations; Rights of Dissenting Stockholders.

 



 

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be $290,000,000, less the amount of Company Debt outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and less the amount by which Third
Party Expenses exceed $5,000,000 (the "Merger Consideration"). At Closing,
Parent shall (i) pay or cause to be paid the Merger Consideration, less the
Escrow Amount and the Expense Amount, in accordance with the Paying Agent
Spreadsheet and the Optionholder Spreadsheet; (ii) deposit an amount equal to
$29,000,000 (the "Escrow Amount") into the Escrow Fund; and (iii) deposit
$1,000,000 (the "Expense Amount") into the Expense Fund.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Stockholders, the
Optionholders or the Warrantholder:

 



 

(i) each outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than a Dissenting
Share) will be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive, without interest thereon, an amount of cash equal to
the Common Price Per Share;

 



 

(ii) each outstanding share of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock or Class B
Convertible Preferred Stock (other than in each case any Dissenting Share)
will be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right
to receive, without interest thereon, an amount of cash equal to:

 



 

(A) the Common Price Per Share plus

 



 

(B) the Common Price Per Share, multiplied by the quotient of (1) the
aggregate amount of dividends accumulated on such share as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (2) $1.051;

 



 

(iii) each outstanding share of Class C Convertible Preferred Stock (other
than a Dissenting Share) will be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive, without interest thereon, an
amount of cash equal to:

 



 

(A) the Common Price Per Share plus

 



 

(B) the Common Price Per Share, multiplied by the quotient of (1) the
aggregate amount of dividends accumulated on such share as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (2) $1.650; and

 



 

(iv) each outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and are held by any Stockholder who has not voted in favor
of or consented to the approval of this Agreement (a
"Dissenting Stockholder") and who has the right to demand, and has properly
demanded in writing, an appraisal of such shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive any portion of the
Merger Consideration, but rather shall be converted into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware Law. If, after the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses any such right to appraisal, each such share of Company
Capital Stock of such Dissenting Stockholder shall no longer be considered a
Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to have converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration,
without interest, as provided in Section 1.6(b), pursuant to the exchange
procedures set forth in Section 1.9(a). At the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Shares shall automatically be canceled, cease to exist and no longer be
outstanding, and each holder of a stock certificate that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive either payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the Delaware Law or the portion of the Merger Consideration provided in
Section 1.6(b), as the case may be, upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 1.9(a). The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of the Company's receipt of any demands for appraisal of shares of
Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the Delaware Law, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or agree to
do or commit to do any of the foregoing except to the extent required by
Delaware Law.

 



 

1.7 Company Warrant. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all
such actions (including those actions set forth in Section 4.14) as may be
necessary to provide that the Company Warrant, if and to the
extent outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled
and terminated as of the Effective Time in exchange for the right to
receive, without interest thereon, that portion of the Merger Consideration
equal to:

 



 

(a) (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issuable
to the Warrantholder if, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) the
Company Warrant were to be exercised in full and (B) the shares of Class C
Convertible Preferred Stock received upon such exercise were to be converted

exchange for Company Vested Options or the Company Warrant, and the deposit
of the related pro rata Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund and the related

paid to, and the amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund and the Expense Fund on

cent, in connection with the preparation of the Paying Agent Spreadsheet and

aggregate amount of $1,000,000.00 being deposited in the Expense Fund.

(b) The Company has provided Parent true, correct and complete copies of all
lease guaranties, subleases, and Contracts for the leasing, use or occupancy
of, or otherwise granting a right in or relating to each Leased Real
Property, including all amendments, terminations and modifications thereof
that are currently in effect ("Lease Agreements"). All of the Lease
Agreements are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms.
There is not, under any of the Lease Agreements, any existing event of
default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto. Since January 1, 2006,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of a
default, alleged failure to perform, or any offset or counterclaim with
respect to any Lease Agreement, which has not been fully remedied and
withdrawn. The Closing will not affect the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
continued use and possession of the Leased Real Property for the conduct of

followed with respect to similar properties, and is otherwise suitable for
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
Ordinary Course. To the Knowledge of the Company, the operation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on each Leased Real Property, including the
improvements thereon, does not violate in any material respect any applicable
building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such Leased Real
Property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not dependent
on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or,
in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in,
all of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, free and
clear of any Liens, except as reflected in the Current Balance Sheet.

tear.

(p) The Company and its Subsidiaries have the right to use, pursuant to valid

(q) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this

Subsidiaries. Except for disclosures to the employees, consultants, and

circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the
disclosure, delivery or license by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
or any Person acting on their behalf to any Person of any source code for
any software owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, except
for disclosures to the employees, consultants, and contractors of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their employment and
except for source code the Company, in the Ordinary Course, generally
provides or makes available in source code or human readable form. Section
2.16(q) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each Contract pursuant to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has deposited, or is or may be
required to deposit, with an escrow holder or any other Person, any source
code for any software owned by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, and
describes whether the execution of this Agreement or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in and of itself, would
reasonably be expected to result in the release from escrow of any
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries including
source code for any software owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(r) The Company and its Subsidiaries have acted in a commercially reasonable
manner (based on standard industry practices and currently-maintained

of the Company and its Subsidiaries are free of any computer programs,
instructions, routines, features, or code intended to adversely affect the
operation, integrity, or function of any computer system, computer program
(including the software products and computer-based services themselves) or
data operated upon, or stored by, any computer system, or that provide
unauthorized access to, or use of, computer systems or the data processed by,
or stored using, any computer system, including viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, time bombs, spyware, and trap doors. The Company and its Subsidiaries

Company Employees"), with the same benefit plans and level of benefits as
the Transferred Company Employees received immediately prior to the Effective
Time, which shall remain in place through December 31, 2009 or until the

service," as that term is defined in Section 411(a)(5) of the Code, with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent the Company gave effect) as if
such service was with Parent, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
calculation of benefits under the employee benefits plans maintained by

Employees is transitioned to the benefit plans of the Parent: (i) each
Transferred Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Parent employee benefits plan; and
(ii) for purposes of each employee benefit plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Transferred Company Employee, Parent

actively-at-work requirements of such plans to be waived for such Transferred
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents. If coverage for a
Transferred Company Employee under Parent's benefit plans commences after
January 1, 2010, Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Transferred Company Employee and his or her covered dependents between
January 1, 2010 and the date on which such Transferred Company Employee's
participation in the corresponding new plan begins to be taken into account
under such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Transferred Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan.

carry over up to 40 unused hours per the Company vacation plan and schedule

allotment of vacation days based on length of service. Effective April 1,

vacation days as allowed under the Parent\'s paid time off policy.

required in connection with any legal proceedings against or governmental
investigations of the Stockholders or government reporting obligation of the
Represented Parties or for any other reasonable business purpose arising from
or relating to this Agreement, during regular business hours and upon the
prior written request thereto by the Securityholder Committee. In the event
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation wishes to move or destroy any such
books or records, such party shall first give 10 days' prior written notice
to the Securityholder Committee, including the address of the location to
which such books or records shall be moved. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, may
restrict the Securityholder Committee's access to the Books and Records to
the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity applicable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to restrict or prohibit access to
any such information. Such access shall also be subject to the
granting party's reasonable security measures and insurance requirements.
Additionally, all access by the Securityholder Committee to the Books and
Records shall be conditioned upon entering into a confidentiality agreement

other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

4.11 Certain Tax Matters.

 



 

(a) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
Contracts with respect to or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and a Person other than the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be terminated
as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor
its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

(b) Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes. The Company shall prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Returns of or which include
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed (after giving
effect to any valid extension of time in which to make such filing) on or
prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) all
Taxes shown due with respect to such Tax returns. Parent shall be responsible
for the preparation and filing of all Returns with respect to Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. Parent shall provide to the Securityholder Committee a copy
of each such Return that includes a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date within 30 days of filing such return.
If the Securityholder Committee determines that any Return should have
been prepared differently, the Securityholder Committee may so inform
the Company. If the Company agrees, it will amend such Return. If the
Company disagrees, and the Parties cannot resolve their differences, then the
Parties shall engage a nationally recognized accounting firm to make a final
determination of whether or not the Return should be amended. The fees and
expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Parties.

 



 

(c) Tax Proceedings.

 



 

(i) Parent shall promptly notify the Securityholder Committee in reasonable
detail of the receipt from a Taxing authority of any notice of the
commencement of any Tax audit, examination or judicial or administrative
proceeding or receipt from a Taxing authority of any proposed adjustment,
demand or notice of deficiency which if determined adversely to the relevant
taxpayer or after the lapse of time could be grounds for payment of Losses by
the Stockholders under Article VII (each, a "Tax Proceeding").


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-43-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and subject
to the limitations in this paragraph, with respect to any Tax Proceeding, (A)
Parent shall at Parent's expense (x) control and direct such Tax Proceeding
through representatives of its own choosing and (y) keep the Securityholder
Committee reasonably and promptly informed of any significant developments in
such Tax Proceeding; (B) to the extent reasonably required, the
Securityholder Committee shall promptly execute or cause to be executed by
the relevant taxpayer reasonable powers of attorney or other documents
authorizing such representatives of the party controlling such Tax Proceeding
to act in connection with such Tax Proceeding; and (C) Parent shall not pay
or compromise any Tax liability asserted in such Tax Proceeding for which
indemnification is available hereunder without the Securityholder Committee's
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (provided that Parent has exhausted commercially reasonable avenues
to eliminate, settle or compromise such Tax liability in a manner intended to
minimize the amount required to be paid from the Escrow Amount pursuant to
Article VII). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholder Committee
may, at its election and at its expense, and upon request submitted
to Parent, employ counsel of its own choosing who will be entitled to (I)
receive reasonable advance notice of all meetings and phone conferences with
taxing authorities in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (II) participate
in all such meetings and phone conferences with taxing authorities in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (III) review and comment in advance
on any written submissions to a taxing authority in connection with any such
Tax Proceeding.

 



 

(iii) Parent and the Securityholder Committee shall cooperate fully in
connection with any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Proceeding and
making the Securityholder Committee or his representatives available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Securityholder Committee
further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Taxing authority or any other Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereby agree that, to the extent permissible by applicable Tax law: (i) all
Tax deductions resulting from payments in respect of Company Vested Options
pursuant to this Agreement (other than payments from the Escrow Fund or the
Expense Fund) will be allocated to taxable periods of the Company and its
Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date (and to that portion of the
Closing Date prior to the Closing); (ii) accordingly, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will include all such Tax deductions on their separate Company
federal, state or foreign income tax returns (as applicable) for the short
taxable year ending with the Closing Date. Unless required by applicable Tax
law or a final determination in a Proceeding with a Tax authority, Parent
will not claim such deductions on any federal, state or foreign income tax
returns of Parent for periods after the Closing (except to the extent such
deductions comprise part of a net operating loss carryforward from taxable
periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing
Date).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-44-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

4.12 Supplements to Disclosure Schedule. On the second Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
supplement to the Disclosure Schedule which shall update the Disclosure
Schedule such that any information contained in the representations and
warranties set forth in Article II is true and correct as of such delivery
date. Thereafter, the Company shall deliver to Parent from time to time, up
to the Closing Date, any further supplements to the Disclosure Schedule that
are necessary in order that the information contained in the representations
and warranties set forth in Article II continues to be true and correct as of
the time of such delivery, up to the Closing Date. Any such further
supplements shall be provided as promptly as practicable after the Company
gains Knowledge that a representation or warranty in Article II is no longer
true or correct. In the event any such supplement to the Disclosure Schedule
is necessary to make a representation or warranty set forth in Article II
true and correct as of the date hereof, Parent may seek reimbursement from
the Escrow Amount to the extent available in accordance with the provisions
of Article VII. Otherwise, however, Parent may not seek reimbursement from
the Escrow Amount with respect to any disclosure provided in a supplement to
the Disclosure Schedule delivered pursuant to this Section 4.12.

 



 

4.13 Access and Investigation. Prior to the Closing Date, upon
reasonable notice, the Company will, and shall cause its representatives to,
afford Parent and its advisors, at Parent's expense, with reasonable access,
during regular business hours, to the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries'
personnel, properties, Contracts, permits, Books and Records and other
documents and data for purposes of enabling Parent to verify the accuracy of
the Company's representations and warranties in this Agreement, such rights
of access to be exercised in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and is
conducted under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company.
Nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information to
Parent if such disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion (a) jeopardize
any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (b) contravene any applicable
law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which the Company
or its Affiliates is a party).

 



 

4.14 Warrant Termination Agreement. Between the date hereof of the Closing
Date, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Warrantholder to execute and deliver a warrant termination agreement, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Parent (the "Warrant
Termination Agreement").

 



 

4.15 Potential Section 280G Payments. As soon as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, but in any case prior to the Closing, the
Company shall (a) secure from each person who has a right to any payments
and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein that would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) a waiver of such person's rights to some or all of
such payments and/or benefits (the "Waived 280G Benefits") applicable to such
person so that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such
person shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" that would not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code and (b) submit to the stockholders
of the Company for approval of any such Waived 280G Benefits by such number
of such stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code any (i) such Waived 280G Benefits and (ii) other potential payments
and/or benefits that would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code and that do not constitute a binding obligation of
the Company as of the date hereof (the "Other 280G Benefits"). Prior to
seeking such stockholder approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such
stockholder approval materials to Parent and shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such materials. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the
Company's stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4.15 and that either (A) the requisite number of
stockholder votes was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits and
Other 280G Benefits that were subject to such vote (the "280G Approval") or
(B) that the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the
Waived 280G Benefits and Other 280G Benefits subject to such vote shall not
be paid or made (and, in such case, the Merger Consideration shall be reduced
by the amount of the Waived 280G Benefits and Other 280G Benefits not paid or
made).

7.4 Third Party Claims.

 



 

(a) If any legal proceedings shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by
any third party (the "Third Party Claim") in respect of which any party may
have an obligation pursuant to this Article VII to pay for the Losses of
another party, the party asserting such right to payment for incurred Losses
(the "Damaged Party") shall give the party from whom such right is sought
(the "Responsible Party") written notice thereof as promptly as possible, but
any failure to so notify the Responsible Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to the Damaged Party other than to the extent the
Responsible Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Securityholder Committee shall serve as the Responsible Party
with respect to any assertion by a Parent Damaged Party of a right to payment
for incurred Losses and, at the request of a Stockholder Indemnified Party
asserting a right to payment for incurred Loss, the Securityholder Committee
may assume and perform some or all of the rights and responsibilities of a
Damaged Party that otherwise would be attributable to such Stockholder
Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) The Responsible Party may assume control of the defense of the Damaged
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Damaged Party if:

 



 

(i) within 15 days after receipt of such written notice, the Responsible
Party confirms in writing that the Responsible Party will defend the Damaged
Party from and against the Losses the Damaged Party may incur as a result of
or arising out of the Third Party Claim;

 



 

(ii) the Responsible Party provides the Damaged Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Damaged Party that the Responsible Party has the
financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and to fulfill
its obligations to pay for Losses hereunder with respect to all Losses that
are reasonably likely to result from or arise out of the Third Party Claim;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-52-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(iii) the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Damaged
Party (in the case of Parent, acting reasonably through its Board of
Directors), reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the Damaged Party's
reputation or its relationships with its employees, stockholders, or any of
its significant customers or business partners;

 



 

(iv) the Third Party Claim does not seek an order, injunction, non-monetary
or other equitable relief against the Damaged Party which the Damaged Party
(in the case of Parent, acting reasonably through its Board of Directors)
determines reasonably and in good faith could, if successful, have a Material
Adverse Effect; and

 



 

(v) the Responsible Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently and keeps the Damaged Party informed of material
developments with respect to the Third Party Claim and consults with the
Damaged Party prior to making material strategic decisions with respect to
the defense of the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) So long as the Responsible Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim and the conditions set forth in Section 7.4(b) hereof are being
met:

 



 

(i) the Damaged Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of
such claim; provided, however, that the employment of such counsel shall be
at the expense of the Responsible Party if the Damaged Party determines in
good faith that such participation is appropriate in light of conflicts of
interest;

 



 

(ii) the Responsible Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Damaged Party before agreeing to the entry of any judgment arising from such
claim, entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend
against such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) provided, however, that the Responsible Party shall
not require such prior written approval if such settlement or judgment (A)
includes as an unconditional term thereof be given by each claimant or
plaintiff to each Damaged Party of a release from all liability in respect of
such claim and (B) involves only the payment of money damages that are
covered in full by the payment obligations of the Responsible Party; and

 



 

(iii) the Responsible Party shall not be liable to such Damaged Party
hereunder for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Damaged Party
in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that the Responsible Party shall be liable
for such legal expenses if the Damaged Party determines in good faith that
the incurrence of the same is appropriate in light of defenses not available
to the Responsible Party, or in light of conflicts of interest.

 



 

(d) If any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.4(b) above becomes
unsatisfied, the Damaged Party shall, after reasonable written notice to the
Responsible Party, have the right to defend such claim in such manner as
it may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the Responsible Party, and
the Responsible Party will promptly reimburse the Damaged Party to the extent
the Damaged Party is entitled to payment of Losses hereunder, provided that,
in the event that the Damaged Party is a Parent Damaged Party, such Losses
shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-53-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) A claim for payment of Losses for any matter not involving a third-party
claim shall be asserted by the Damaged Party to the Responsible Party in
writing as promptly as possible, setting forth specifically the obligation
with respect to which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to and the
alleged basis for such claim (to the extent known) and, if known, the amount
of the Losses asserted or which may be asserted by reason thereof, but any
failure to so notify the Responsible Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to the Damaged Party other than to the extent the
Responsible Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Responsible Party
shall be entitled to contest any such claim in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

7.5 Limitations on Payment for Losses.

 



 

(a) Neither the Parent Damaged Parties nor the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties may assert any claim for Losses under Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a),
as applicable, until the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of all such
claims equals or exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Threshold"), provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to Losses related to (i) a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
2.1 (Organization of the Company), Section 2.2 (Company Capital Structure),
Section 2.5 (Authority), Section 2.10 (No Undisclosed Liabilities), Section
2.13 (Tax Matters), Section 2.23 (Brokers' and Finders' Fees; Third Party
Expenses), Section 3.1 (Organization, Standing and Power), Section
3.2 (Authority), and Section 3.5 (Brokers' and Finders' Fees) (collectively,
the "Fundamental Representations"). No claims for individual Losses of
less than $50,000 ($20,000 in the case of Losses related to a breach of a
Fundamental Representation) may be asserted at any time or shall be included
in determining whether the Threshold has been met. Thereafter, liability
shall be for the full amount of such Losses without regard to the Threshold
or to the minimum individual Losses described above. After the Closing,
claims against the Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of this
Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the parties with
regard to any Loss arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) The amounts for which the Responsible Party shall be liable hereunder
shall be net of any insurance proceeds received by the Damaged Party in
connection with the circumstances giving rise to the right of payment for
Losses.

 



 

(c) No Damaged Party shall be entitled to recover consequential or incidental
Losses with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty or non-
performance of any obligation under this Agreement (or otherwise relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby), and under no circumstances shall such
damages be considered "Losses" under this Agreement; provided, however,
Losses shall include such consequential and incidental Losses in the event
that the Damaged Party is liable for such Losses pursuant to a Third
Party Claim.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect
to claims for Losses pursuant to this Article VII, in the event it is
determined either by mutual agreement or by a court of competent jurisdiction
that the Damaged Party is not entitled to payment for Losses hereunder,
Damaged Party shall promptly reimburse all reasonable fees and expenses
incurred by the Responsible Party in defense of such claim.

7.6 Escrow and Expense Funds; Escrow Period; Remedy.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, the Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Securityholder Committee shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement, and
the Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit with the Escrow Agent (i) the Escrow
Amount, such deposit of the Escrow Amount to constitute an escrow fund (the
"Escrow Fund") to satisfy the payment obligations provided for in Section
7.2, and (ii) the Expense Amount, such deposit of the Expense Amount to
constitute a fund for use of the Securityholder Committee to pay the costs,
expenses and liabilities incurred by the Securityholder Committee or any of
its members in accordance with Section 7.7 (the "Expense Fund"). The Escrow
Amount shall be available to compensate the Parent Damaged Parties for any
claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for
which they are entitled to recovery under this Article VII for a period of
eighteen months after the date hereof (the "Escrow Period"). The right of
Parent's Indemnified Parties to seek compensation shall be limited solely and
exclusively to the Escrow Fund and no current or former stockholder,
director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company shall have any liability of any nature to Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of either Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to any breach by the Company of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. Subject to
Section 7.7(c), upon expiration of the Escrow Period, any remaining portion
of the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Represented Parties in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement (less any amounts to cover any
outstanding claims), and no Person shall then have any further liability to
the Damaged Parties for claims related to this Agreement, except with respect
to fraud as set forth in Section 7.6(b).

 



 

(b) If any claims for payment of Losses have been made pursuant to this
Article VII and the same are still pending or unresolved at the expiration of
the Escrow Period, such claims will continue to be subject to the provisions
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any Person
(and such Person's pro rata share of the Escrow Fund shall not be the
exclusive remedy) in respect of Losses arising out of common law fraud
committed by such Person.

7.7 Securityholder Committee.

 



 

(a) The Stockholders, by the approval and adoption of this Agreement pursuant
to the Required Stockholder Consent, shall irrevocably appoint Richard J.
Brekka, Jaime W. Ellertson and Thomas A.F. Krueger, as the Stockholders' true
and lawful agents, representatives and attorneys-in-fact (the
"Securityholder Committee") with respect to all actions called for by this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to be taken for and on behalf of the
Stockholders, on their individual and collective behalf, including the
obligations set forth in Articles I and IV of this Agreement. The
Optionholders and the Warrantholder, in connection with their exchange of
Company Vested Options and the Company Warrant pursuant to Section
1.9, shall execute instructions appointing the members of the
Securityholder Committee as their true and lawful agents, representatives and
attorneys-in-fact with respect to all actions called for by this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement to be taken for and on behalf of the Optionholders,
on their individual and collective behalf, including the obligations set
forth in Articles I and IV of this Agreement. Thereafter the Securityholder
Committee shall be authorized to act, and shall act, on behalf of all
Stockholders and, to the extent they have delivered such executed
instructions, Optionholders and the Warrantholder collectively (the
Stockholders and the Optionholders and Warrantholder delivering such
instructions from time to time hereafter being referred to herein
collectively as the "Represented Parties"). The Represented Parties further
authorize the Securityholder Committee to (i) give and receive notices and
communications on behalf of the Represented Parties, (ii) authorize payment
to any Parent Damaged Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by
any Parent Damaged Party, (iii) object to such payments, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Parent Damaged Party
against the Escrow Fund, and (iv) to take all other actions that are either
(A) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Committee
for the accomplishment of the foregoing, or (B) specifically mandated by the
terms of this Agreement or Escrow Agreement. This power of attorney is
irrevocable and shall survive the death, incapacity, incompetence,
dissolution, liquidation or similar event or status of any Represented Party.
The appointments of the members of the Securityholder Committee may be
changed by Represented Parties representing at least a majority in interest
in the Escrow Fund ("Majority Represented Parties") from time to time upon
not less than 30 days' prior written notice to Parent; provided, however,
that any member of the Securityholder Committee may not be removed unless
Represented Parties with at least a two thirds interest in the Escrow Fund
agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted member. A
vacancy in the Securityholder Committee may be filled by the Majority
Represented Parties or left vacant. No bond shall be required of the
Securityholder Committee or any member thereof, and the members of the
Securityholder Committee shall not receive any compensation for
their services. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Committee shall constitute notice to or from the Represented
Parties as it sent or received from all Represented Parties. The right of
a Securityholder Committee member to resign shall be as set forth in the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) All decisions and actions by the Securityholder Committee, including any
agreement between the Securityholder Committee and Parent relating to the
defense or settlement of any claims for which the Represented Parties may be
required to pay Losses of Parent pursuant to Article VII hereof, shall be
binding upon all of the Represented Parties, and no Represented Parties shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. All
actions of the Securityholder Committee shall require the approval of a
majority of the members of the Securityholder Committee. At any time the
Securityholder Committee may, but is not required, to designate in writing to
Parent, with the right to change such designation, a single individual or
entity (the "Committee Representative") to act on behalf of the
Securityholder Committee. If such designation is made, and until revoked by
the Securityholder Committee, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any action (including the delivery
of any certificate, the resolution of any claims and the waiver of any
rights) taken by the Committee Representative in the name of or on behalf of
the Securityholder Committee, and the Committee Representative's approval,
authorization, or taking of any such action shall be deemed conclusive proof,
without any obligation on the part of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Escrow Agent to verify the authority of the Committee Representative, of
the approval by the Securityholder Committee of such action.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-56-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Neither the Securityholder Committee nor any of its members shall have
any fiduciary, agency or other duties to the Represented Parties and its only
obligations shall be as expressly set forth in this Agreement. The
Securityholder Committee and its members are serving in that capacity solely
for purposes of administrative convenience, and are not personally liable for
any of the obligations of the Represented Parties hereunder, and the Parent,
the Merger Sub and the Represented Parties agree that they will not look to
the underlying assets of the Securityholder Committee or any of its members
for the satisfaction of any obligations of the Company or the
Represented Parties. The Securityholder Committee, and any member thereof,
shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or the Represented Parties
for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Securityholder Committee while
acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment or acting
pursuant to the advice of counsel or with the consent of the Majority
Represented Parties. The Represented Parties shall jointly and severally
hold harmless the members of the Securityholder Committee and hold the
members of the Securityholder Committee harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without fraud, gross negligence, willful breach of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or bad faith on the part of the
Securityholder Committee and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Securityholder Committee's duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees, out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder Committee. The
Securityholder Committee shall be entitled to retain its own counsel and
other professional advisors in connection with the acceptance, performance or
administration of the Securityholder Committee's duties hereunder or under
the Escrow Agreement or the exercise of any of the Securityholder Committee's
rights hereunder, and shall further be entitled to withdraw from the Expense
Fund the amount of any fees and expenses of such counsel and professionals.
Any losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by the Securityholder Committee
or any of its members arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the duties hereunder may be recovered by the Securityholder
Committee from the cash deposited in the Escrow Fund that is otherwise
distributable to the Represented Parties (and not distributable to the Parent
or subject to a pending Parent Indemnified Claim) or from the cash deposited
in the Expense Fund, in each case pursuant to the terms hereof and of the
Escrow Agreement, at the time of distribution. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholder Committee shall constitute a decision of
the Represented Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Represented Parties; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Committee as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Represented Parties.
The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Securityholder Committee.

 



 

(d) Each Represented Party agrees, in addition to the foregoing, that:

 



 

(i) Parent and any other Parent Damaged Party shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Securityholder
Committee as to (A) the settlement of any claims for compensation by Parent
or such Parent Damaged Party pursuant to Article VII hereof or (B) any other
actions required or permitted to be taken by the Securityholder Committee
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, and no party hereunder shall have
any cause of action against Parent or such Parent Damaged Party for any
action taken by Parent or such Parent Damaged Party in reliance upon the
instructions or decisions of the Securityholder Committee;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-57-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) the provisions of this Section 7.7 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees
and successors of each Represented Party, and any references in this
Agreement to a Represented Party shall mean and include the successors to the
rights of such Represented Party hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 



 

(iii) the provisions of this Section 7.7 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Represented Party may have in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this
Section 7.7 are inadequate; therefore, Parent shall be entitled to seek
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
damages if Parent brings an action to enforce the provisions of this
Section 7.7.

this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive termination of this Agreement
and the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any
liability for any breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the first

seeking all remedies available at law or equity for a breach of this
Agreement prior to Closing, including specific performance.

9.3 Interpretation. The terms of this Agreement are contractual and not mere
recitals. Any pronouns in this Agreement that refer to a particular gender
mean and refer to the appropriate gender or neuter when applied to a
particular party or other Person. Unless otherwise stated, all references in
this Agreement to paragraph, subparagraph, section, subsection, clause and
subclause are intended to refer to paragraphs, subparagraphs, sections,
subsections, clauses and subclauses, respectively, of this Agreement. The
parties acknowledge and agree that titles and headings for particular
paragraphs, sections and subsections of this Agreement have been inserted
solely for reference purposes. As a result, section and paragraph headings,
titles or captions should not be used to interpret or construe the terms of
this Agreement. Except as to words or phrases specifically defined in
this Agreement, the parties agree that all words and phrases selected to
state the terms of this Agreement are to be interpreted in accordance with
their plain and generally prevailing meaning and not with regard to any
different meaning that any of the parties might otherwise attach to a
particular word or phrase. Without limiting the foregoing, the term
"including" shall not be interpreted to exclude any item not listed. The
parties further acknowledge that, as a result of either drafting or
negotiating specific terms, or as a result of approving language selected by
others to state specific terms, they are each and all equally responsible for
the wording of the terms of this Agreement. As a result, the parties agree
and acknowledge that in interpreting this Agreement, the rule of contractual
interpretation and construction that provides that an ambiguity in the terms
of an agreement shall be construed against the party drafting such term does
not apply to the interpretation or construction of the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

9.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement. This Agreement
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

hereto and the Disclosure Schedule (i) contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein
identified and merges and integrates any and all previous and contemporaneous
understandings and agreements (in fact or law) whether written or oral,
between or among any of the parties concerning such matters, and (ii) shall
not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent may
assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as
long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parent's obligations
hereunder. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto only by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party against
whom enforcement is sought.

unenforceable in any judicial proceeding in any jurisdiction, then such
provision shall be deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent and in
the manner necessary, either by a court of competent jurisdiction or the
parties hereto, to render the same valid and enforceable, or shall be deemed
excised from this Agreement, as the case may require, and this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced to the maximum extend permitted by law, as if
such provision had been originally incorporated in this Agreement as so
modified or restricted, or as if such provision had not been originally
incorporated in this Agreement, as the case may be.

 



 

9.8 Governing Law. This Agreement and the respective rights and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be governed by, and
shall be determined under, the internal laws of the State of Delaware

with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters

otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process.

IRREVO­CABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

9.10 Waiver. No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have
waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim,
power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and any such
waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

 



 

9.11 Equitable Remedies. Each party agrees that a failure to comply with
any provision of this Agreement will cause the other parties irreparable harm
and that such other parties will be entitled to equitable relief, without
the necessity of posting a bond, including specific performance, an
injunction, a restraining order and/or other equitable relief in order to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, which right is in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any other remedy to which such party is entitled under law
(including monetary damages).
