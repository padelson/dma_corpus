_AGREEMENT_

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

_ ARTICLE 1 _

_THE OFFER_

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
Agreement Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to
purchase all of the shares of Company Common Stock at the Offer Price. The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to all of the Companys stockholders and
contains the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and _Annex A_.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Purchaser to,
and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only
to the satisfaction (or to the extent waivable, the waiver by Parent or
Purchaser) of the conditions set forth in  _Annex_ __ _ A_ (the " _Offer
Conditions_ "). Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but is not obligated
to) at any time, and from time to time, in its sole discretion to waive any
Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not: (i) decrease the
Offer Price; (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer; (iii)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased in the
Offer; (iv) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that is
adverse to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or impose conditions
to the Offer that are different than or in addition to the Offer Conditions;
(v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition; (vi) amend or

 



-2- ##### Table of Contents

  

 modify any of the terms of the Offer in a manner that is adverse to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock; or (vii) extend or otherwise change
any time period for the performance of any obligation of Parent or Purchaser
(including the Expiration Time) in a manner other than pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the Offer shall remain open
until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the twentieth (20th)
Business Day (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is commenced (the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or, if the period of time for which the Offer is open
shall have been extended pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section_
__ _ 1.1(c)_, or as may be required by applicable Law, the time and date to
which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such
later time and date to which the Offer has been extended, the " _Expiration
Time_ "). Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer (including in order to comply with Exchange
Act Rule 14e-1(b) in respect of any change in the Offer Price). If, as of any
scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion
(and without the consent of the Company or any other Person) extend the Offer
on one or more occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business
Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree in writing),
until such time as all Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided,
however_ , that, without the Companys written consent, Purchaser shall not
extend the Offer beyond the earlier of the Outside Date and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_. If, (i) as of any
Expiration Time, any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) is not
satisfied and has not been waived by Parent or Purchaser or (ii) as of any
Expiration Time, all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived by Parent
or Purchaser other than the Minimum Condition, then on every occasion under
clause (i) and on not more than two (2) occasions under clause (ii), in each
case at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for an
additional period of ten (10) Business Days (or such longer or shorter period
as the parties hereto may agree in writing) to permit such Offer Condition(s)
to be satisfied; _provided that_ if, at or prior to any Expiration Time,
Parent delivers a notice (a " _Financing Extension Notice_ ") to the Company
representing that the full amount of the Debt Financing has not been funded
and would not be available to be funded at the consummation of the Offer if
the Expiration Time were not extended, Purchaser may extend (and re-extend)
the Offer for one or more periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten
(10) Business Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by
Parent in its sole discretion (or such longer period as Parent and the Company
may mutually agree) to permit the funding of the Debt Financing;
_provided, however_ , that, without the Companys prior written consent,
Purchaser shall not extend the Offer, and without Purchasers prior written
consent, Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer, in each case
beyond the earlier of the Outside Date and the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_.

 

(d) _Consummation of the Offer; Payment_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) consummate the Offer, accept for payment (the time of such
acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and thereafter pay for all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as practicable after the Expiration Time and, in any

 



-3- ##### Table of Contents

  

 event, no later than three (3) Business Days after the consummation of the
Offer. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price
payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller
in cash, without interest, subject to the withholding of any Taxes required by
applicable Law.

 

(e) _Termination of the Offer_. Purchaser shall not terminate or withdraw
the Offer prior to the Expiration Time without the prior written consent of
the Company, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire
any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, and cause any depositary
acting on its behalf to promptly return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 

(f) _Offer Documents_. On the commencement date of the Offer, Parent and
Purchaser shall: (i) file, or cause to be filed, with the SEC, in accordance
with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements
and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ TO_") that will contain or
incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase, the form of the related letter
of transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, and
together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Schedule TO and related Offer Documents to
be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the Companys
stockholders that may be required by applicable Law or reasonably requested
in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)_.
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company or its counsel. Each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company agrees to correct promptly any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.
Upon receipt of any written or oral comments by Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent
and Purchaser agree to: (A) promptly provide the Company and its counsel with
a copy of any such written comments (or a description of any such oral
comments); (B) provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
comment on any proposed response thereto, and give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel; (C)
provide the Company and its counsel an opportunity to participate with Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel in any material discussions or meetings with the
SEC or its staff; and (D) provide the Company and its counsel with copies of
any written comments or responses submitted by Parent or Purchaser in response

(g) _Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer,
unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company, any shares of
Company Common Stock subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed
not to be validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are
"received", as defined by Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL.

 

(h) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, merger, issuer tender offer, exchange
of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring
on or after the Agreement Date and prior to Purchasers acceptance for payment
of, and payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, and such
adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
action and shall as so adjusted from and after the date of such event, be the
Offer Price; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
1.1(h)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to the Company Common Stock that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_. On the date the Offer Documents are filed
with the SEC, the Company shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_") that, subject to _Sections_ __ _
5.4(d)(i)_ and _5.4(d)(ii)_ , shall include the Company Board Recommendation.
The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents and to the inclusion of a copy of the
Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall promptly
furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and
Purchaser that may be required by applicable Law to be set forth on Schedule
14D-9 or reasonably requested in connection with any actions contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
filed with the SEC pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_ to be disseminated
to the Companys stockholders as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act concurrently with the dissemination of the Schedule TO to the holders of

in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or a Change in Company Board
Recommendation, Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.
Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent

 with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as

of any written or oral comments received by the Company or its counsel from

updated listings and computer files of holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
assistance as Parent, Purchaser or their agents may reasonably require in

deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to satisfy the Merger

deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ". The
Payment Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner
directed by Parent;  _provided, however_ , that: (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or

such funds shall be the property of Parent.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment
Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock

transmittal in customary form; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the

the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer to the Payment
Agent as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book Entry
Shares, together with a duly executed and valid letter of transmittal and, in
each case, such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment

Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such

 



-9- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share; and (B) each Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_, each Company
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

 

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares as of the date that is one
(1) year after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not
theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar
Laws) for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two
years after the Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Body) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable to any
holder of any Company Stock Certificate, Book Entry Share (in his or her
capacity as a holder of shares of Company Common Stock), Company Option or
Company RSA such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld from such
consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of any Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share or to any other
Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or
similar Law.

2.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who does not validly tender
such holders shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer and properly makes a
demand for appraisal of

 



-10- ##### Table of Contents

  

 such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares
being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the
Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through
failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time
or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be
converted into and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of each Company Stock Certificate representing such
shares or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, in accordance with the surrender
of such shares in accordance with the requirements of  _Section_ __ _
2.8(b)_.

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any
demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, (B) any withdrawal of any such demand, and (C) any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity and right to control any
and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice
or instrument; _provided_ that the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or applications, or waive
any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or agree to do
any of the foregoing. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled
under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive payment of the "fair value" for such
holders shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation after giving effect to any withholdings or deductions required by
applicable Law (but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally
determined pursuant to the DGCL).

 

2.10 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that: (a) neither the Company nor

letter (each, a " _Fee Letter_ ") associated therewith (with pricing terms
and any other terms not relating to conditionality or availability of the Debt
Financing being redacted), in each case, regarding the terms and conditions of
the financing to be provided thereby (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ "; the debt commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Debt

equity financing commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, among
Guarantor and Parent (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and the equity
commitments thereunder, the " _Equity Financing_ "; the Debt Commitment Letter

(b) On the Closing Date, assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Company in _Article 3_ and compliance by the Company
with its obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ (to the extent
necessary to satisfy the Financing Conditions), the aggregate amount of funds
to be provided pursuant to the Financing Letters, if funded in accordance
with the terms thereof (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of
any or all "market flex" provisions related thereto), together with available
cash on hand, will be sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid by
Parent or Purchaser hereunder and under the Financing Letters, including the
(i) payment of the Offer Price in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1_; (ii) payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_
in accordance with the terms hereof; (iii) payment of all amounts to be paid
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ in accordance with the terms hereof; (iv)
consummation of the Refinancing (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter);
and (v) payment (including by offset against the proceeds of the Debt
Financing) of all fees, expenses and other compensation payable by Purchaser

effect and are the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Purchaser
and Guarantor (and, to the knowledge of Parent, the Lender), enforceable
against Parent, Purchaser and Guarantor (and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
Lender), as applicable, in accordance with their terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full net amount of the
Financing (including any "flex" provisions) other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Letters.

 

(d) As of the Agreement Date, (i) the Financing Letters have not been
amended, modified, supplemented or waived in any respect, and (ii) the
respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or
otherwise modified in any respect (nor has Guarantor or any Lender notified
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates in writing of its intention to
seek such a withdrawal, rescission or modification). Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ , the compliance
by the Company in all material respects with all of its covenants
contained in this Agreement and the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, in
each case, to the extent necessary to satisfy the Financing Conditions, none
of Parent or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates has any reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any of the Financing
Conditions, or that the Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Financing Letters will not be
available to Parent and Purchaser at the time required to consummate the
Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable). As of the Agreement Date, no event
has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach or a failure of any
condition on the part of Parent, Purchaser or, to the knowledge of Parent, any
of the other parties thereto that would result in any portion of the Financing
to be unavailable or delayed. Parent and Purchaser have fully paid, or caused
to be fully paid, any and all commitment or other fees that are due and
payable on or prior to the Agreement Date pursuant to the terms of the
Financing Letters and each Fee Letter.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent understands and acknowledges and agrees that under the terms of this
Agreement, Parents obligation to consummate the Offer or the Merger is not in
any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parents consummation of the
Financing or any other financing arrangements, Parents obtaining of the
Financing or any other financing or the availability, grant, provision or
extension of the Financing or any other financing to Parent.

 

4.9 _Brokers_. None of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective

by this Agreement, except those to be borne by Parent, Purchaser or the

time during the period commencing three (3) years prior to the date that the

"interested stockholder" of the Company (as such term is defined in Section
203 of the DGCL).

 

4.11 _Guarant_ _y_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Guaranty. The Guaranty
is in full force and effect and constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws
affecting creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting the
availability of specific performance and other equitable remedies. No event
has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of Guarantor under the Guaranty.

 

4.12 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the accuracy and completeness of
the representations and warranties in _Article 3_ , and (b) that the most
recent financial statements included in an Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by
the Company with the SEC present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
at the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the
periods covered thereby, then immediately following the Acceptance Time and
after giving effect to the consummation of the Offer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not: (i) be insolvent (either because its
financial condition is such that the sum of its debts, including contingent
and other liabilities, is greater than the fair market value of its assets or
because the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required
to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature); (ii) have unreasonably small capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged; or (iii) have incurred debts, or intend to incur debts, including

Acquisition Proposal in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ that the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal
and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to enter into the Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  _Section_ __ _
5.4(d)_, the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company
Board Recommendation pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 5.4(d)(i)_ or _5.4(d)(ii)_ ;
or (ii) terminate this Agreement and enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)(iii)_, unless: (A) the
Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is
prepared to (1) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ ") or (2) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(i)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action
by the Company Board is not related to a Superior Proposal, contain a
description of the Intervening Event giving rise to such proposed action or,
if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior
Proposal, contain the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, a
description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including a copy of the Company Acquisition Agreement and any attachments
thereto in the form to be entered into (it being understood and agreed that
the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a
Change in Company Board Recommendation); (B) Parent does not make, within
four (4) Business Days after the receipt of such notice (as extended in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_, the " _Notice Period_ "), a
proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel), cause
such Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board
to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation or cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, as the case may be; and (C) prior to effecting such Change in
Company Board Recommendation, the Company complies with this _Section_ __ _
5.4(e)_. During the Notice Period, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no event later than one (1)
Business Day after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that describes the terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the
Notice Period, permit Parent to make proposals to the Company Board regarding
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and negotiate in
good faith with Parent with respect thereto, so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or the Intervening Event no longer
forms the basis for the Company Board to effect a Change in Company Board
Recommendation, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such amendments
(it being understood and agreed that there may be multiple extensions of the
Notice Period). Any material changes with respect to such Intervening Event,
or changes to the financial terms of or other material changes to such
Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Company
effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(i)_ shall require the Company to
provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal
Notice and a new three (3) Business Day period.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from: (i) taking and disclosing to the
Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii)
making any disclosure with regard to an Acquisition Proposal to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its

 



-46- ##### Table of Contents

  

 fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)_ shall not affect the obligations of the Company and
the Company Board and the rights of Parent and Purchaser under _Section_ __ _
5.4(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_, to the extent applicable to such
disclosure (it being understood that a mere "stop, look and listen" letter or
similar communication made in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act shall not be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation).

 

5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the
other parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the Agreement Date: (i)
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the Offer and the Merger; and (ii) all other necessary
filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and notices with
other Governmental Bodies under other applicable Antitrust Laws relating to

all information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification,
registration and notice subject to advice of such partys antitrust counsel;
and (D) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions reasonably necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act or any foreign Antitrust Law. In connection with the foregoing:
(1) whenever possible, each party shall give the other party reasonable prior
notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement
with, any Governmental Body regarding any filings, forms, declarations,
notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the other to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, any proposed communication, understanding or agreement with
any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger, subject to advice of such
partys antitrust counsel; (2) where reasonably practical, none of the
parties hereto shall independently participate in any meeting or conversation,
or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Body in
respect of any filings or inquiry without giving the other party prior notice
of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Body, the opportunity to attend and/or participate; (3) if one party is
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Body from
participating in or attending any meetings, conferences or conversations, the
attending party shall keep the other reasonably apprised with respect thereto;
and (4) the parties hereto shall, to the extent practicable, consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any information or proposals
submitted in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust
Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)_, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts: (i) to avoid the entry of any Restraint; and (ii) to eliminate
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Body so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date).

reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary

and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
obligations of the Company, Parent and Purchaser to obtain the Financing
shall be governed exclusively by _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, and not this _Section_
__ _ 5.5_.

 

5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, Parent and the Company shall
thereafter consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Offer and the Merger and consider in
good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange or trading
market on which securities of Parent or the Company are listed, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.

 

5.7 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors
and officers of the Company and each Company Subsidiary (in all of their
capacities) (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the
Agreement Date by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the
applicable Company Charter Documents

 



-48- ##### Table of Contents

  

 and the indemnification agreements in existence on the Agreement Date with
any directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and (ii)
include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors), as the case may be, charter and
bylaws for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the current
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification
of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in
the applicable Company Charter Documents; _provided_ that the provisions of
this clause (ii) shall be deemed to have been satisfied by the Company
purchasing a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.7(b)_. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, or any of their respective successors or assigns: (A) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporations or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (B) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume in
writing all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_.

(b) The Company shall, prior to the Expiration Time, purchase a six (6)
year "tail" prepaid directors and officers liability (and fiduciary)
insurance policy with terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Persons, or other Persons entitled to the benefit of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_, as applicable, than the existing directors and
officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company,
covering, without limitation, the Offer and the Merger;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend, in the aggregate for
all six (6) years, in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such tail insurance policy; and _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) Parent shall cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to assume, honor and
fulfill all obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to
any written indemnification agreements with the Indemnified Persons.

 

(d) Except as required by applicable Law, the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified
in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other
person who is a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_
__ _ 5.7(b)_) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified
Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred
to in _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_ (and, if and to the extent applicable, their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party hereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and, if and to the extent applicable,
their heirs and representatives) under this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity), and, with respect
to any action or proceeding commenced within six (6) years after the Closing
Date, shall continue until the final disposition of such action or
proceeding.

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, notify the other:

 

(i) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure of such Person to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of such
party set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the other party
to consummate the Offer or the Merger, or the remedies available to the
parties hereto, and _provided further_ , that any unintentional failure to
give any such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the
purposes of _Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ of _Annex_ __ _ A_ or  _Section_ __ _
7.1(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_, as applicable;

(ii) to the extent the Company has Knowledge of such notice or

consent of such Person is required in connection with the Offer or the
Merger;

(iii) of any written communication from any Governmental Body related
to the Offer or the Merger; and

(iv) of any proceedings commenced and served upon it or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to the Companys Knowledge or Parents knowledge, threatened
in writing against it or any of its Subsidiaries, that, if pending on the

Section of this Agreement.

or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any stockholder or
derivative suit, action, litigation or claim against the Company or its
directors relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. The
Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such
stockholder litigation, and shall not agree to or offer any settlement without
Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense or
negotiation or settlement of any litigation contemplated by this _Section_ __
_ 5.9_.

5.10 _Rule_ __ _ 16b-3_. Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all
such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by
_Article 2_ , and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company
by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, (i) the term _"_
_Covered Employees_ " shall mean employees who are employed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary at the Effective Time; and (ii) the term "
_Continuation Period_ " shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time.

(b) _Compensation_. During the Continuation Period (or until the
termination of the relevant employee, if sooner), Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, provide the Covered Employees with compensation (such
term to include salary, bonus opportunities, commissions, and other
compensation other than any equity-based compensation, long-term incentives,
change in control, retention, transition, stay or similar arrangements) and
employee benefits (excluding defined benefit pension benefits, nonqualified or
deferred compensation benefits, equity-based benefits and retiree benefits
except to the extent provided for in any Company Employee Plan existing as of
(and made available to Parent prior to) the Agreement Date) that are in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and benefits (excluding
equity-based compensation, long-term incentives, change in control, retention,
transition, stay or similar arrangements, defined benefit pension benefits,
nonqualified or deferred compensation benefits, equity-based benefits and
retiree benefits) being provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that __ Parents obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall be subject to such modifications as are
necessary to comply with applicable Law of the foreign countries and their
political subdivisions, and the CBA.

 

(c) _Crediting of Payments_. In the event any Covered Employee first
becomes eligible following the Effective Time and in the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs to participate under any employee benefit plan,
program, policy, or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries that is not a Company Employee Plan in
effect at the Effective Time (a " _Parent Employee Benefit Plan_ "), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
any Covered Employee under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, or vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the analogous Company Employee Plan that the
Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the
Parent Employee Benefit Plan; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles
paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs in which such amount was paid, to the
same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Employee Plan
that the Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under
the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

(d) _Service Crediting_. As of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
shall recognize, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee prior to the
Effective Time, to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor Entities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) for vesting,
benefit accruals and eligibility purposes under any employee benefit plans to
the same extent such service is credited under a comparable Company Employee
Plan (other than any equity-based plan) for the same purpose. In no event
shall anything contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(d)_ result in any
duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period of service.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, express or implied, shall be
construed to limit the right of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries) or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement, Parent
Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, policy, program,
Contract, agreement or arrangement, nor shall anything in this _Section_ __ _
5.11_, express or implied, be construed to require Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) or any of their respective Affiliates
to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee or service of
any Person for any fixed period of time, or be construed to confer on any
Person any right to employment or service or any particular term or condition
of employment or service, following the Effective Time. The provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed
to: (i) constitute an establishment of or an amendment of any Company
Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement, any Parent Employee Benefit Plan
(or an undertaking to amend any such plan) or any other benefit or
compensation plan, policy, program, Contract, agreement or arrangement; (ii)
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates to, following the Effective Time, discharge or
terminate the services of any employee (including any Covered Employee),
officer, director consultant or service provider of the Surviving Corporation,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates at any time for
any reason or no reason whatsoever, with or without cause; or (iii)
confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any
current or former employees, officers, directors, or independent contractors
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or any of their beneficiaries)),

assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies whatsoever
(including any third-party beneficiary rights) (with respect to the matters
provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ or otherwise) under or by reason
of this _Section_ __ _  5.11_.

5.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser will not permit
any assignment of, any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver
of any provision or remedy pursuant to the Financing Letters if such
assignment, amendment, modification or waiver would, or would be reasonably
expected to: (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, including
by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the
Debt Financings (unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount or Alternate Debt Financing that

 



-52- ##### Table of Contents

  

 complies with _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ has been made available in a
corresponding amount); (ii)(A) impose new or additional conditions to the
Financing, (B) expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing
or (C) otherwise amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner (with respect to this clause (C) that would (1)
materially delay or prevent the Closing or (2) make the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the Financing Conditions) less likely to occur);
(iii) adversely impact in any material respect the ability of the Company (as
a third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter), Parent or
Purchaser to enforce its respective rights against the other parties to the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto; or (iv)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Financing or the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

(b) _Debt Financing and Alternate Debt Financing_. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall use (or cause to be used) its reasonable best efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and timely consummate the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto), including using its reasonable
best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter; (iii) negotiate,
execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or as such terms, but not
conditions, may otherwise be agreed (including any "market flex" provisions
related thereto); (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the Debt
Financing that are applicable to, and within the control of, Parent,
Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter; and (v) consummate the Debt Financing at or
prior to the Acceptance Time. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (other than due to the failure of a condition to the consummation of
the Debt Financing resulting from a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement and as a
result of which alternative financing sources are not otherwise then
available) and such portion is required to fund the payments required to be
made by the Parent or the Purchaser hereunder, each of Parent and Purchaser
shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event: (A) obtain alternative
debt financing (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ ") from alternative sources
on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
Parent and Purchaser than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and
in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is
still available and available cash on hand, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) obtain one or more new financing
commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New
Debt Commitment Letter_ "), which New Debt Commitment Letter will replace the
existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in part; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Alternate Debt Financing (including any commitments therefor) shall
not have any terms and conditions that (1) taken as a whole, are materially
less favorable than those in the existing Debt Commitment Letter and (2)
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall promptly
(and no later than two (2) Business Days after receipt thereof) provide the
Company with a true and complete copy of any New Debt Commitment Letter,
together with any related exhibits, schedules, supplements and term sheets

 



-53- ##### Table of Contents

  

 (and a true and complete copy of any fee letter in connection therewith,
with pricing terms and any other terms not relating to conditionality or
availability of the Debt Financing being redacted). In the event that Parent
or Purchaser obtains Alternate Debt Financing, any reference in this Agreement
to the "Financing Letters," the "Debt Commitment Letter," the "Debt Financing"
or the "Financing" (and other like terms in this Agreement) will be deemed
modified to refer to such Alternate Debt Financing.

 

(c) _Information_. Parent and Purchaser shall: (i) keep the Company
reasonably informed as to the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
or any applicable Alternate Debt Financing; and (ii) promptly (and no later
than two (2) Business Days) provide the Company with copies of all executed
amendments, modifications or replacements of Debt Commitment Letters (it
being understood that any amendments, modifications or replacements shall only
be as permitted herein) related to the Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing Parent and Purchaser shall promptly (and no later
than two (2) Business Days) notify the Company: (A) of any written repudiation
or termination or material breach or default by any party to the Financing
Letters of which Parent, Purchaser or their Affiliates become aware; (B) of
the receipt by Parent of any purported repudiation or termination of the
Financing Letters; or (C) if for any reason either Parent or Purchaser in good
faith no longer believes that one of Parent or Purchaser will be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing. Parent shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably
practical after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor
to Parent.

(d) _No Financing Condition_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of Parent and Purchaser understands and acknowledges and
agrees that under the terms of this Agreement, Parents and Purchasers
obligation to consummate the Offer and the Merger is not in any way
contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parents and Purchasers consummation
of the Financing or any other financing arrangements, Parents and Purchasers
obtaining of the Financing or any other financing or the availability,
grant, provision or extension of the Financing or any other financing to
Parent and Purchaser.

(e) _Financing Cooperation_.

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company will use reasonable best efforts, and
will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives, to use reasonable best efforts, to provide Parent, at
Parents sole expense, with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent to
assist it in the arrangement, syndication and consummation of the Debt
Financing. Such assistance shall include (as applicable, subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements):

 

(A) participation by the senior management team of the Company in the
marketing activities undertaken in connection with the marketing of the Debt
Financing, including the preparation of customary marketing and syndication
documents and materials (all such documents and materials, collectively, the "
_Financing Documents_ ");

 

(B) preparing and furnishing to Parent and the Financing Sources as
promptly as practicable all available pertinent financial information
(including

 



-54- ##### Table of Contents

reimbursement and indemnification obligation of Parent pursuant to _Section_

deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company and the Company Related Parties and any other Person

 integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) each
of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and the Company, respectively, in the circumstances in which
such termination fee is payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision; and (iii) without these agreements, neither the Company
nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
either Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the other party for the payment of any amount
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, such paying party shall pay the other
party its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

_ARTICLE 8_

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

 

8.1 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement, including any annex or exhibit attached hereto, may be
amended or supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement signed by
all of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such amendment
shall be made or given that requires the approval of the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law unless such approval is obtained. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the definitions of "Financing
Sources" and "Lender" and _Sections 5.12(h)_ and _7.3(c)(ii)_ this _Section_
__ _ 8.1_ and _Sections 8.4_ , _8.5_ , _8.6_ , _8.8_ and _ 8.9_ (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver
or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any such
Section) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Financing Sources adversely affected thereby.

 

8.2 _Extension of Time, Waiver, etc_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, solely as to itself: (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
party hereto; (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, waive compliance by any other party with any of the
agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, waive any of such partys conditions set forth in this
Agreement, in each case, including agreements and conditions set forth in any
annex or exhibit attached hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of such rights preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

8.3 _No Survival_. None of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. This _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall not limit the
survival of any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall impair Parents and the
Surviving Corporations rights under any representations and warranties
insurance policy that may be obtained by Parent in connection with this
Agreement.

 8.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement,
including the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the
documents and instruments relating to the Offer and the Merger referred to
in this Agreement, the Tender Agreements, and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended, and
shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of employment with any person, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns or to otherwise create
any third-party beneficiary hereto, except (x) with respect to: (a) the rights
of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Offer Price and
the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Articles 1_ and _ 2_ and the
holders of Company Equity Awards to receive the consideration described in
_Article 2_ ; and (b) the directors and officers of the Company covered by
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_; and (y) the Financing Sources shall be express third
party beneficiaries of _Sections 5.12(h)_ , _7.3(c)(ii)_ and _8.1_ , this
_Section_ __ _ 8.4_, and _Sections 8.5_ , _8.6_ , _8.8_ and _8.9_.

 

8.5 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of law
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other
jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
(Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the
matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively
in the federal courts of the United States, the federal court of the United
States sitting in the district of Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof (the " _Selected Courts_ "), in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (i) agrees not to commence any such
action or proceeding except in the Selected Courts; (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
Selected Courts; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such
courts; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any

 



-65- ##### Table of Contents

  

 other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction
of the courts referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ in the manner
provided for notices in _Section_ __ _ 8.10_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of this
Agreement, no party hereto, nor any of its Affiliates, will bring, or support
the bringing of any Legal Proceeding against any Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing Letters or the performance thereof, anywhere other than
in (i) any New York State court sitting in the County of New York or (ii) the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and any such Legal
Proceeding shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of
law principles that would result in the application of the Law of any
other jurisdiction.

8.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCING) AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 8.6_.

 8.7 _Attorneys_ __ _Fees_. In any action at law or suit in equity to
enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the
prevailing party in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a
reasonable sum for its attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in such action or suit.

 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_.

(a) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached,
and that the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such
nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific
performance and the issuance of injunctive and other equitable relief. The
right to specific performance shall include the right of the Company to
enforce the terms of the Guaranty and the right of the Company to cause Parent
and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including Parents and Purchasers obligations to pay
the Companys

 



-66- ##### Table of Contents

  

 stockholders and holders of Company Equity Awards in accordance with the
terms of _Article 1_ and _Article 2_ hereof) to be consummated on the terms
and subject to the conditions and obligations set forth in this Agreement.
The parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or
other equitable relief, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 8.8(a)_ or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parents and Purchasers obligations to
consummate the Offer or effect the Merger unless (i) all of the Offer
Conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Acceptance Time and the Closing, as applicable, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Company has given notice
in writing to Parent representing that it is ready, willing and able complete
the Closing, (iii) the full amount of the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing and (iv) Parent and Purchaser have failed to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that: (a)
Purchaser may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the
Company; and (b) Parent and Purchaser may assign as a collateral assignment,
any of their respective rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement
to their or their Subsidiaries Financing Sources, but in any case no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, of any of
their respective obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

8.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or

agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable

_ANNEX A _

 

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined herein
will have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
to which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

1\. Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Purchaser to pay for or return
tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after termination
or withdrawal of the Offer)), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock
tendered in connection with the Offer unless, immediately prior to the then-
applicable Expiration Time:

 

(a) any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the
HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; and

(b) there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to
the Expiration Time that number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, all shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the
Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery instructions for which certificates have
not yet been "received" (as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the
DGCL) by the depositary in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee prior
to the Expiration Time) which, upon consummation of the Offer (for the
avoidance of doubt, assuming that the shares of Class B Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn will convert to shares of Class A
Company Common Stock at the time of the consummation of the Offer), when added
(without duplication) to any shares of Company Common Stock then owned,
directly or indirectly by Purchaser, Parent and any other Subsidiaries of
Parent, collectively represent as of the Expiration Time at least a majority
of the voting power of the sum of (i) of the aggregate voting power of the
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the consummation
of the Offer; and (ii) the aggregate voting power of the shares of Company
Common Stock that the Company may be required to issue upon the vesting
(including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer),
conversion, settlement, or exercise of all then outstanding options, warrants
or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock,
or other rights to acquire or be issued shares of Company Common Stock,
regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions
thereof (the condition in this clause (b) being referred to herein as the "
_Minimum Condition_ ").

2\. Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act (relating to the obligation of Purchaser to pay for or return
tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after termination or
withdrawal of the Offer)), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock
tendered in connection with the Offer if, immediately prior to the then-
applicable Expiration Time, any of the following conditions exist:

 



A-1 ##### Table of Contents

  

(a) any Restraint or Law shall be enacted, enforced, promulgated, amended,
issued or deemed applicable to the Offer by any Governmental Body of
competent jurisdiction in the United States, that is in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the making
or consummation of the Offer or the Merger; 

(b) the representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in
_Section 3.4_ and _Section 3.7(b)_ were not as of the Agreement Date, or
are not as of the Expiration Time, true and correct in all respects as though
made on and as of such date (except to the extent any such representation and
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date) (other than any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.4_ that do not individually or in the
aggregate increase the aggregate consideration required to be paid by
Parent and/or Purchaser under _Article 1_ and _Article 2_ of the Agreement by
more than a _de minimis_ amount); (ii) set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_,
_Section 3.1(c)_, _Section 3.3_ and  _Section 3.22_ were not as of the
Agreement Date, or are not as of the Expiration Time, true and correct in all
material respects (without giving effect to any "materiality," "in all
material respects," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers),
as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of
an earlier date, in which case as of such date); and (iii) set forth in
_Article 3_ but not referenced by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) were not
as of the Agreement Date, or are not as of the Expiration Time, true and
correct (without giving effect to any "materiality," "in all material
respects," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers), as if
made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct does not have and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(c) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations or covenants under the Agreement and
such failure to perform or comply with such obligations or covenants shall
not have been cured prior to the Expiration Time; or

(d) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a certificate, signed on behalf of the Company by its chief executive officer
or chief financial officer that none of the conditions set forth in clauses
(b) and (c) of paragraph 2 above shall have occurred and be continuing as of
the Expiration Time.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by Parent
or Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to
the Expiration Time in the sole discretion of Parent or Purchaser. The failure
by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time, subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.
