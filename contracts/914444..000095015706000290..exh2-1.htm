THE  MERGER

 

 

Section  2.1. _The  Merger_.

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time, in accordance with the IBCA, and upon the terms
and subject  to  the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall be merged with  and  into the Company, at which time the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall  cease  and the Company shall survive the
Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. 

 

 

(b)  On  the  Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall file articles
of merger (the  " _Articles  of Merger_ ")  meeting the requirements of the
IBCA with the Registrar of Companies of the  Bahamas. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of  Merger are registered by the
Registrar of Companies of the Bahamas, or at such  later time as the Company
and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the Articles  of Merger (such time as
the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective  Time_ ").

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

(c)  The  Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the  IBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto,  from and after the Effective Time, all property,
rights, privileges, immunities,  powers, franchises, licenses and authority
of the Company and Merger Sub shall  vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations,  restrictions and duties of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become  the  debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(d)  The  closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")  shall  take place
(i) at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP located in  New York,
New York, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event, no  later than
the second Business Day) after the day on which the last condition  to  the
Merger set forth in Article VIII is satisfied or validly waived (other 
than  those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the
Closing  Date, but subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of such
conditions)  (provided, that if all the conditions set forth in Article VIII
shall not have  been satisfied or validly waived on such day, then the
Closing shall take place  on the first Business Day on which all such
conditions shall have been or can  be  satisfied or shall have been validly
waived) or (ii) at such other place and  time or on such other date as the
Company and Parent may agree in writing (the  actual date of the Closing, the
" _Closing  Date_ ").

 

 

Section  2.2. _Conversion  of Securities_.  At the  Effective Time,
pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and  without any
action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders  of the
Ordinary Shares:

 

 

(a)  Each  Ordinary Share held by the Company as treasury stock or
otherwise owned by  Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately  prior to the Effective Time (including Ordinary Shares
acquired by Parent  immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
Equity Rollover  Commitments), if any, shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist,  and no payment or distribution shall be made or
delivered with respect  thereto.

 

 

(b)  Each  Merger Sub Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the  Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly
issued, fully paid  and non-assessable ordinary share, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(c)  Each  Ordinary Share (including any Company Restricted Shares) issued
and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Ordinary
Shares to be  canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and Dissenting Ordinary
Shares),  automatically shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive $76.00  in cash, without interest (the " _Merger  Consideration_
"),  payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate
formerly  representing such Ordinary Share (a " _Certificate_ ")  in the 
manner provided in Section 2.3. Such Ordinary Shares (including any Company 
Restricted Shares), other than those canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and 
Dissenting Ordinary Shares, sometimes are referred to herein as the "
_Merger  Shares_." 

 

 

(d)  Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
required by the IBCA (but  only to the extent required thereby), Ordinary
Shares that are issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Ordinary Shares  to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a))
and that are held by holders of  such  Ordinary Shares who have not

voted  in  favor of the approval of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and  who  have properly exercised dissenters' rights with respect
thereto in accordance  with, and who have complied with, Section 83 of the
IBCA (the " _Dissenting  Ordinary Shares_ ")  will  not be convertible into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and  holders of such
Dissenting Ordinary Shares will be entitled to receive payment  of fair value
of such Dissenting Ordinary Shares in accordance with the  provisions of such
Section 83 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect  or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to dissent and payment under the  IBCA. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or  effectively
withdraws or loses such right, each of such holder's Dissenting  Ordinary
Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into,  at 
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration and have 
become exchangeable therefor, without any interest thereon. At the Effective 
Time, any holder of Dissenting Ordinary Shares shall cease to have any
rights  with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 83 of the
IBCA  and  as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give
Parent (i) notice  of  any written objections or elections to dissent and
(ii) the opportunity to  participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to  such  notices and demands for payment. The
Company shall not, except with the prior  written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for  payment of fair value or settle any
such demands.

 

 

(e) If  between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of  outstanding Ordinary Shares is changed into a different number of shares
or  a  different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification,  recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, other  than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger
Consideration payable per  Ordinary Share shall be correspondingly adjusted.

 

 

(f) Each  Ordinary Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
subject  to  vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans and  any  applicable restricted stock award agreements
(collectively, the " _Company  Restricted Shares_ ")  shall,  by virtue of
this Agreement and, without further action of the Company, Parent,  Merger
Sub or the holder of such Company Restricted Shares, vest and become  free 
of such restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be 
canceled, retired and shall cease to exist and shall be converted into the 
right  to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 
2.2(c). ****

 

 

(g) The  Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs outstanding
immediately prior  to  the Effective Time shall be treated as provided in
Section 2.4.

 

 

(h) For  the  avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
contribution  of  Ordinary Shares (including Company Restricted Shares, if
any) to Parent pursuant  to the Equity Rollover Commitments shall be deemed
to occur immediately prior  to  the Effective Time and prior to any other
above-described event.

 

 

Section  2.3. _Payment  of Cash for Merger Shares_.

 

 

(a)  Prior  to  the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company that is  reasonably satisfactory to the Company to serve as the
disbursing agent for  the  Merger Consideration and payments in respect of
the Company Options, Company  SARs and Company

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

RSUs,  unless another agent is designated as provided in Section 2.4(a)
(the " _Disbursing  Agent_ ").  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will cause to be deposited with the  Disbursing Agent cash in the aggregate
amount sufficient to pay the Merger  Consideration in respect of all Merger
Shares outstanding immediately prior  to  the Effective Time plus any cash
necessary to pay for Company Options, Company  SARs and Company RSUs
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  pursuant to Section 2.4.
Pending distribution of the cash deposited with  the Disbursing Agent, such
cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the  holders of Merger Shares,
Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs  outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and shall not be used for  any other purposes;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to
invest such cash in (i) obligations  of  or guaranteed by the United States
of America or any agency or instrumentality  thereof, (ii) money market
accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase  agreement or banker's
acceptances of, or demand deposits with, commercial banks  having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, or (iii)  commercial paper
obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard and Poor's  Corporation or
Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Any profit or loss resulting  from, or
interest and other income produced by, such investments shall be for  the
account of Parent.

 

 

(b) As  promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation  shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each
record holder of  Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
a letter of  transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares
for the Merger  Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal
will be in customary  form and will specify that delivery of Certificates
will be effected, and risk  of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the  Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such
Certificate or Certificates to the  Disbursing Agent together with a properly
completed and duly executed letter  of  transmittal and any other
documentation that the Disbursing Agent may reasonably  require, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger  Consideration payable
in exchange therefor, without interest. Until so  surrendered and exchanged,
each such Certificate shall, after the Effective  Time, be deemed to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,  and until such
surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder  of  such
outstanding Certificate in respect thereof.

 

 

(c) If  payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Merger  Shares formerly represented by the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered  in  exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the Certificate  or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in  proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall  pay  to the Disbursing Agent any applicable
stock transfer taxes required as a result  of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Merger  Shares or establish to the
satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such stock  transfer taxes have
been paid or are not payable.

 

 

(d) After  the  Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the
stock transfer books  of the Company of the Ordinary Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior  to  the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented  to  the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Disbursing Agent, such shares shall  be  canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance  with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(e) If  any  cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed
twelve months after  the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to
Parent or the Surviving  Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not
surrendered such holder's  Certificates for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof prior  to  that time shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment  of  the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger  Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall be  liable to any holder
of Certificates for an amount paid to a public official  pursuant to any
applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining  unclaimed by
holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior to such  time  that
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any 
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become  the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and
clear of any  claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) No  dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving  Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the  holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, including Dissenting
Ordinary  Shares.

 

 

(g) Except  as  provided in Section 2.2(a), from and after the Effective
Time, the holders  of Ordinary Shares (other than Dissenting Ordinary Shares)
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with  respect to such Ordinary Shares, other than the right to receive
the Merger  Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

 

 

(h)   In  the  event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making  of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be  lost,  stolen or destroyed, in addition to
the posting by such holder of any bond  in  such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent  may  direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Surviving  Corporation or the
Disbursing Agent with respect to such Certificate, the  Disbursing Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed  Certificate the Merger
Consideration in respect thereof entitled to be received  pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

 

(i) Parent,  Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent shall be entitled
to deduct  and  withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
hereunder any amounts  required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Tax Law. To the extent  any amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all  purposes as having been paid to the holder
from whose Merger Consideration  the  amounts were so deducted and withheld.

 

 

Section  2.4. _Treatment  of Company Options, Company SARs and Company
RSUs_.

 

 

(a)  As  of the  Effective Time, each Company Option and each Company SAR
that is outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled
and extinguished,  and  the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an
amount in cash equal to the  product of (i) the number of Ordinary Shares
subject to such Company Option  or Company SAR and (ii) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration  over the exercise price per share of such
Company Option or Company SAR, without  interest. All payments with respect
to canceled Company Options and canceled  Company SARs shall be made by the
Disbursing Agent (or

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

such  other agent reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall
designate  prior  to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective  Time from funds deposited by or at the
direction of Parent for the purpose  of  paying such amounts in accordance
with Section 2.3(a).

 

 

(b) As  of the  Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time will be canceled and extinguished,
and the holder thereof will  be  entitled to receive an amount in cash equal
to the Merger Consideration, without  interest. All payments with respect to
canceled Company RSUs shall be made  by  the Distributing Agent (or such
other agent reasonably acceptable to the Company  as Parent shall designate
prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably  practicable after the
Effective Time from funds deposited by Parent for the  purpose of paying such
amounts in accordance with Section 2.3(a).

 

 

(c) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Company and Parent will adopt such
resolutions and  take  such other commercially reasonable actions as are
reasonably necessary in order  to effectuate the actions contemplated by
Section 2.2(f) and this Section 2.4,  without paying any consideration or
incurring any debts or obligations on behalf  of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, _provided_   that  such resolutions and actions shall expressly
be conditioned upon the  consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and  shall be of no effect if this Agreement
is terminated.

 

 

(d) Parent,  the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent (or such
other agent  designated pursuant to Section 2.4(a) or Section 2.4(b) hereof),
shall  be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts to be paid
hereunder in  respect of Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs
amounts required  to be  deducted and withheld under any applicable Tax Law.
To the extent any amounts  are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as  having been paid to the holder of Company
Options, Company SARs or Company  RSUs  from whose payments in respect of
Company Options, Company SARs or Company  RSUs  the amounts were so deducted
and withheld.

Agreement, (i) none of the Financing Commitments has been  amended or
modified, and (ii) the respective commitments contained in the  Financing
Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.  As of  the

by the terms of the Financing  Commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming
the accuracy of the Company's  representations and warranties contained

Parent, Merger Sub or any direct investor in Parent  under any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments or otherwise be  reasonably likely to
result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby  to be
unavailable. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the Company's 
representations and warranties contained herein, neither Parent, Merger Sub 
nor  any of the direct investors in Parent has any reason to believe that it
will  be  unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be
satisfied by  it  and contained in the Financing Commitments. Parent, Merger
Sub and their  respective Affiliates have fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other  fees  required by the terms of the Financing Commitments to
be paid on or before  the  date of this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of
the Company's representations  and warranties contained herein, the proceeds

by Parent for the consummation of  the  Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

_Equity  Rollover Commitments_ "),  pursuant to which such parties have
committed to contribute to Parent that  number of Ordinary Shares set forth
in such letters for shares of capital stock  of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time. As of the date of this  Agreement, the Equity Rollover
Commitments are in full force and effect. The  only conditions precedent to
the obligations of (i) WLG, SK or HBK or  (ii) Istithmar under the Equity
Rollover Commitments are those contemplated  by  the terms of the Equity
Rollover Commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming  the accuracy of the
Company's representations and warranties contained herein,  neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor any direct investor in Parent (or, in the case  of  WLG, SK
or HBK) has any knowledge that any event has occurred which, with or  without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach  under
any term or condition of the Equity Rollover Commitments or otherwise  be 
reasonably likely to result in any portion of the commitments contemplated 
thereby to be unavailable. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of 
the  Company's representations and warranties contained herein, neither
Parent,  Merger Sub nor any direct investor in Parent (or, in

the  case  of WLG, SK or HBK) has any reason to believe that (i) WLG, SK or
HBK or (ii)  Istithmar will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition  to  be satisfied by it and contained in the Equity Rollover
Commitments. 

 

 

Section  5.9. _Parent  and Merger Sub_.  Each of  Parent and Merger Sub
has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in  the  transactions
contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have  engaged in no
other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities  or 
obligations other than as contemplated herein, including in connection with 
arranging the Financing. As of March 20, 2006, there were 10 ordinary shares 
of  Merger Sub outstanding, representing the only shares of Merger Sub
outstanding  and entitled to vote on the Merger.

Agreement_ ")  and  the equity rollover letters, dated as of the date
hereof, from Istithmar (the  " _Istithmar  Equity Rollover Commitment_ "), 
no  direct or indirect equity investor in Parent or Merger Sub, or any
Affiliate  thereof (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), is
subject to  any  voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction
with respect to  the  voting of any Ordinary Shares it owns beneficially
(determined for the purposes  of this paragraph as set forth in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange  Act) or of record in respect of the Merger or
any transaction involving a  Company Acquisition Proposal or Superior

other applicable  Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the transactions  contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which
would otherwise prevent,  materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall use its  reasonable best efforts to resolve any
such objections or suits so as to permit  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including  in  order to resolve such

selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting  its 
business in a manner which would resolve such objections or suits or
agreeing  to  sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its
business in a manner  which would resolve such objections or suits or
permitting the sale, holding  separate or other disposition of, any of its
assets or the assets of its  Subsidiaries or the conducting of its business
in a manner which would resolve  such objections or suits so long as such
actions, individually or in the  aggregate, do not have, and would not be
reasonably likely to have, a Material  Adverse Effect on the Company;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company may expressly condition any
such sale, holding separate or other  disposal, and any agreement to take any
such action or to conduct its business  in any manner, upon the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated hereby; and
_provided  further_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  no event shall any
shareholder of Parent, or any Affiliate of any shareholder  of  Parent be
required to take any action with respect to any portfolio company  or  agree

Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated  hereby, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all  respects with each other
and use its

respective  reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding  and  to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction  or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect  and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(e)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any  approval or consent from any person with
respect to the Merger, (i) without  the  prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed), none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit  to  pay to such person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or  other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other  obligation due to such person
and (ii) no party or its Affiliates shall be  required to pay or commit to
pay to such person whose approval or consent is  being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or to  incur  any liability or
other obligation ( _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  such party shall give
the other parties hereto the opportunity to make such  payments).

Law, the Company will provide and will cause its Subsidiaries  and  its and
their respective Representatives to provide Parent and Merger Sub and  their
respective authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and  upon

books  and records of the Company and such Subsidiaries (so long as such
access does  not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company)
as Parent or  Merger Sub reasonably may request and (ii) all documents that
Parent or Merger  Sub reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent, Merger Sub  and their Representatives shall not have access to any
books, records, documents  and other information (i) to the extent that
books, records, documents or  other information is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with  a  third party (provided that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts  to  obtain waivers under such
agreements or implement requisite procedures to enable  reasonable access
without violating such agreement), (ii) to the extent  that the disclosure
thereof would result in the loss of attorney-client  privilege, (iii) to the
extent required by applicable Law (provided that  the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enable the provision of  reasonable access without
violating such law) or (iv) to the extent  relating to pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange  of such books, records,
documents or other information (or portions thereof),  as  reasonably
determined by the Company's counsel, would be reasonably likely to  result in
antitrust difficulties for the Company (or any of its Affiliates).  The 
parties will make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in 
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. All information 
exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall be subject to the

Agreements (as hereinafter defined); _provided_   that the  Company shall
promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public 
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to 
any  Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent and
Merger  Sub (subject to the right of the Company to withhold such portions of
documents  or information to the extent relating to pricing or other matters

any of its Affiliates));  and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or
negotiations with respect to  Company Acquisition Proposals or otherwise

respect to which  the requirements of Section 7.4(c) can be satisfied from
and after the No-Shop  Period Start Date (an " _Excluded  Party_ ")  (
_provided_ ,  that  any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party
for all purposes under  this Agreement at such time as the Company

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.4(b), if
at any time following  the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder  Vote, (i) the Company has otherwise complied in
all material respects with  its  obligations under this Section 7.4 and the
Company has received a written  Company Acquisition Proposal from a third
party that the Board of Directors  of  the Company (acting through the
Special Committee, if such committee still  exists, or otherwise by
resolution of a majority of its Disinterested Directors)  believes in good
faith to be bona fide and (ii) the Board of Directors of the  Company (acting
through the Special Committee, if such committee still exists,  or otherwise
by resolution of a majority of its Disinterested Directors)  determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial  advisors and
outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes  or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the  Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its  Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B)  participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Company 
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
,  that  the Company (x) will not, and will not allow Company
Representatives to,  disclose any non-public information to such Person
without entering into an  Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will
promptly provide to Parent  and Merger Sub any material non-public
information concerning the Company or  its  Subsidiaries provided to such
other Person which was not previously provided  to  Parent and Merger Sub
(subject to the right of the Company to withhold such  portions of documents
or information to the extent relating to pricing or other  matters that are
highly sensitive if the exchange of such information (or  portions thereof),
as reasonably determined by the Company's counsel, would be  reasonably
likely to result in antitrust difficulties for the Company (or any  of  its
Affiliates)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 
7.4(b), the Company shall be permitted prior to obtaining the Requisite 
Shareholder Vote to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above 
with  respect to any Excluded Party. From and after the No-Shop Period Start
Date,  the  Company shall promptly (within one Business Day) notify Parent
and Merger Sub  in  the event it receives a Company Acquisition Proposal
from a Person or group  of  related Persons other than an Excluded Party,
including the material terms  and  conditions thereof and the identity of
the party making such proposal or  inquiry, and shall keep Parent and Merger
Sub reasonably apprised as to the  status and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations concerning  the same. Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the No-Shop Period  Start Date, the Company shall
promptly (within one Business Day) notify Parent  and Merger Sub orally and
in writing if it determines to begin providing  information or to engage in
negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition  Proposal received on or after
the No-Shop Period Start Date from a Person or  group of related Persons
other than an Excluded Party pursuant to this Section  7.4(c).

 

 

(d)  Neither  the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall directly  or indirectly (i) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger  Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent  or  Merger Sub, the Recommendation  or (ii)
take any other action or make any other public statement in connection  with
the Company Shareholder Meeting inconsistent with such Recommendation; 
_provided_ ,  that at  any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder
Vote, if the Company  receives a Company Acquisition Proposal which the Board
of Directors of the  Company (acting through the Special Committee, if such
committee still exists,  or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its
Disinterested Directors)  concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the

Board  of  Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee,
if such  committee still exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of
its  Disinterested Directors) may withdraw or modify its Recommendation in a
manner  adverse to Parent and Merger Sub (" _Recommendation  Withdrawal_
")  if  such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with  outside counsel) that failure to take such action would violate its
fiduciary  duties under applicable Law.

 

 

(e)  Nothing  contained in this Section 7.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit  the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position  contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act  or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's
shareholders if, in the good  faith judgment of the Board of Directors
(acting through the Special Committee,  if such committee still exists, or
otherwise by resolution of a majority of  its  Disinterested Directors),
after receipt of advice from its outside legal  counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with disclosure  requirements under applicable
Law; _provided_ ,  any  such disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)
(other than a "stop, look  and listen" letter or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule  14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a Recommendation  Withdrawal unless the Board of Directors of the
Company (acting through the  Special Committee if such committee still
exists) expressly reaffirms in such  disclosure its recommendation in favor
of the approval of this  Agreement.

 

 

(f)  The  Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth
in this Section  7.4 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, shall  be  deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.4 by the
Company.

 

 

(g)  As  used  in this Agreement, the term:

 

 

(i)  " _Acceptable  Confidentiality Agreement_ " means  a 
confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains provisions that are 
no  less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in

between The  Related Company, L.P. and the Company, (C) dated February 7,
2006, between  Providence Equity Partners Inc. and the Company and (D) dated
February 7, 2006,  between Whitehall Street Global Real Estate Limited
Partnership 2005 and the  Company (the " _Confidentiality  Agreements_ "), 
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that an  Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
may include provisions that are less  favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the  Confidentiality Agreements, so long as
the Company offers to amend the  Confidentiality Agreements concurrently with
execution of such Acceptable  Confidentiality Agreement to include
substantially similar provisions for the  benefit of the parties thereto;

 

 

(ii)  " _Company  Acquisition Proposal_ " means  any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any Person or group of Persons other than  Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Affiliates relating to any direct or  indirect acquisition
or purchase (whether in a single transaction or a series  of  transactions)
of a business or businesses that constitutes 30% or more of the  net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken 
as  a whole, or 30% or more of any class or series of Company Securities or 
Subsidiary

Securities,  any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any  Person or group of Persons beneficially owning 30% or more of
any class or  series of Company Securities or Subsidiary Securities, or any
merger,  reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination,  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving  the  Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of

net revenues, net income or assets  of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole);

 

 

(iii)  " _Superior  Proposal_ " means  a  Company Acquisition Proposal,
which was not obtained in violation of this  Section 7.4, and which the Board
of Directors of the Company (acting through  the  Special Committee, if such
committee still exists, or otherwise by resolution  of  a majority of its
Disinterested Directors) in good faith determines, would,  if  consummated,
result in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial  point of
view to the shareholders of the Company (in their capacities as 
shareholders) than the transactions contemplated hereby (x) after receiving 
the  advice of its financial advisor (who shall be a nationally recognized
investment  banking firm), (y) after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation  of  such transaction on the terms set forth therein (as
compared to the terms  herein) and (z) after taking into account all
appropriate legal (with the advice  of outside counsel), financial (including
the financing terms of any such  proposal), regulatory or other aspects of
such proposal; _provided_   that for  purposes of the definition of "
_Superior  Proposal_ ",  the  references to "30% or more" in the definition
of Company Acquisition Proposal  shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority" and the definition of Company  Acquisition Proposal shall only
refer to a transaction or series of transactions  (i) directly involving the
Company (and not exclusively its Subsidiaries) or  (ii) involving a sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets  of  the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

 

Section  7.5. _Director  and Officer Liability_.

 

 

(a)  From  and  after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
comply with all of  the  Company's and its respective Subsidiaries'
obligations to indemnify and hold  harmless (including any obligations to
advance funds for expenses) (i) the  present and former officers and
directors thereof against any and all costs  or  expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines,  losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in  connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or  investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative  (" _Damages_ "), 
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any acts or omissions 
occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time to the
extent  provided under the Company's or such Subsidiaries' respective
organizational and  governing documents or agreements in effect on the date
hereof, including the  approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated  by this  Agreement or arising out of or
pertaining to the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement; and (ii)
such persons against any and all Damages arising out  of  acts or omissions
in connection with such persons serving as an officer,  director or other
fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request  or  for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For a period of  six 
years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be

liability  insurance maintained

on  the  date hereof by the Company and its respective Subsidiaries (the "
_Current  Policies_ ");  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Surviving
Corporation may, and in the event of the cancellation or  termination of such
policies shall, substitute therefor policies with reputable  and financially
sound carriers providing at least the same coverage and amount  and
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered 
persons (the " _Replacement  Policies_ ")  in  respect of claims arising
from facts or events that existed or occurred prior  to  or at the Effective
Time under the Current Policies; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  _however_ , 
that in  no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
annually in excess  of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company under the Current  Policies (the " _Insurance  Amount_ ")  (in 
which event, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable
insurance  as available for the Insurance Amount); _provided_ ,  _further_
,  _however_ ,  that in  lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent
may direct the Company to  purchase "tail" insurance coverage that provides
coverage no less favorable than  the coverage described above, _provided_  
that the  Company shall not be required to pay any amounts in respect of such
coverage  prior to the Closing.

 

 

(b)  This  Section 7.5 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to  be  for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors  or  officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their
respective heirs and personal  representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its  successors and assigns. In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or any  of  its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other  Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially  all its properties and assets to any person
(including by dissolution), then,  and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provision to be made so that  the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation assume and honor the  obligations set forth in this
Section 7.5.

 

 

(c)  The  agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to
be exclusive  of  any other rights to which any such present or former
director or officer is  entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this  Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall release, waive or  impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy  that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, it being  understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section  7.5  is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under any such policies. 

 

 

Section  7.6. _Takeover  Statutes_.  The  parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts (i) to take all  action necessary so that
no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to the  Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and  (ii)  if any such
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing,  to take
all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated  as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and  otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and  the  other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

Section  7.7. _Public  Announcements_.  Except  with respect to any
Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken by the  Company  or its Board
of Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.4,  so  long as
this Agreement is in effect, the

parties  will consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any  public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated  hereby and, except for any press release or public
statement as may be required  by applicable Law, court process or any listing
agreement with the New York  Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press
release or make any such public  statement without the consent of the other
parties (not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed).

 

 

Section  7.8. _Employee  Matters_.

 

 

(a)  Without  limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee
employed by the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time ("
_Current  Employee_ ")  may  have under any Company Benefit Plan,
Employment Agreement or collective  bargaining agreement, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and each  of  its Subsidiaries, for the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending  on  the first anniversary
thereof, to maintain for each Current Employee (i) base  salary or hourly
wage rate, target cash bonus opportunities under annual  programs and
commissions, but excluding equity and equity equivalents  (collectively, "
_Compensation_ "),  that  in the aggregate is no less favorable than, and
(ii) welfare benefits that  in  the aggregate are no less favorable than, in
the case of the foregoing clauses  (i) and (ii), the Compensation and
benefits maintained for and provided to  such  Current Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  subject to
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8, nothing herein shall  (A)
prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plans in 
accordance with their respective terms, or (B) interfere with the Surviving 
Corporation's right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to 
conform with applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall limit the
right  of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to
terminate  the employment of any Current Employee at any time in a manner
consistent with  any applicable contractual obligations and any applicable
employee benefit  plans.

 

 

(b)  As  of and  after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation  to, give each Current Employee full credit for
purposes of eligibility to  participate and vesting (but not for benefit
accrual purposes, except for  purposes of vacation and severance) under any
Employee Benefit Plans and any  other employee compensation and incentive
plans, benefit (including vacation)  plans, programs, policies and
arrangements, in each case maintained for the  benefit of Current Employees
as of and after the Effective Time by Parent,  its  Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation (each, a "Parent Plan") for such  Current Employee's
service prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its  Subsidiaries
and their predecessor entities, to the same extent such service  is 
recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective  Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit
plan" (as  defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),  Parent or its Subsidiaries
shall (i) cause there to be waived any  pre-existing condition or eligibility
limitations or exclusions and  actively-at-work requirements with respect to
the Current Employees and their  eligible dependents and (ii) give effect,
for the year in which the Closing  occurs, for purposes of satisfying any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket  limitations, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed  to,  Current Employees and their
eligible dependents under similar plans maintained  by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which such Current Employees and their  eligible dependents
participated immediately prior to the Effective  Time.

(c)  From  and  after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and all  of  their Subsidiaries to assume and honor, in
accordance with their respective  terms, (i) each existing employment, change
in control, severance and  termination plan, policy or agreement of or
between the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
officer, director or employee of that  company, on the other hand, (ii) each
equity-based plan, program or agreement  and each bonus plan, program or
agreement and (iii) all obligations pursuant  to  existing benefit
restoration plans, equity-based plans, programs or agreements,  bonus plans,
programs or agreements, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued  benefits
under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company  or
its Subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit
arrangements  and agreements in effect as of the Effective Time, in the case
of each of the  foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), to the extent legally
binding on the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(d)  The  provisions of this Section 7.8 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this  Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be  construed to confer upon or give to any person
(including for the avoidance  of  doubt any Company Employees), other than
the parties hereto and their respective  permitted successors and assigns,
any legal or equitable or other rights or  remedies (with respect to the
matters provided for in this Section 7.8) under  or  by reason of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.9. _Financing_. (a)   Prior  to  the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries  to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective  Representatives,
including legal and accounting, to, provide all cooperation  reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and the other 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) participation in 
a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence 
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the 
preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents,  private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and  similar documents required in connection with the
Financing,  (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents,
other  definitive financing documents, or other certificates, legal opinions
or  documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a
certificate  of  the chief financial officer of the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to  solvency matters and consents of accountants for
use of their reports in any  materials relating to the Debt Financing) and
otherwise reasonably  facilitating the pledging of collateral, in each case
effective on or after  the  Effective Time, (iv) furnishing Parent and its
Financing sources with  financial and other pertinent information regarding
the Company as may be  reasonably requested by Parent, including all
financial statements and financial  data of the type required by Regulation
S-X and Regulation S-K under the  Securities Act and of type and form
customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities
Act in  respect of foreign  private issuers (as such term is defined under
the Exchange Act), to consummate  the offering of debt securities
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments,  (v) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain accountants' comfort letters,  legal opinions, surveys and
title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent,  (vi) using its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide monthly financial  statements
(excluding footnotes) within 25 days of the end of each month prior  to the
Closing Date, (vii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit 
the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Company's 
current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures  relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements

and  (B)  effective on or after the Effective Time, establish bank and other
accounts  and  blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the  foregoing, and (viii) taking all corporate actions
reasonably necessary to  permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to
permit the proceeds thereof  to be made available to the Company (it being
understood that (A) to the  greatest extent practicable, the actions
contemplated by this Section  7.9(a)(viii) shall not be required to be taken
until immediately prior to the  Closing and that prior to the taking of such
actions, any current member of  the  Board of Directors may resign and (B)
if such member of the Board of Directors  resigns, the failure of any such
director to take any such action shall not  constitute a failure to satisfy a
condition to Closing). Parent shall, promptly  upon request by the Company,
reimburse, or cause its Affiliates to reimburse,  the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred  by  the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation.  The  Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in  connection with
the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used solely  in  a manner
that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage  the 
Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company and its marks.

 

 

(b)    Parent  shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing on the  terms  and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitments as promptly as  practicable on the terms and conditions described
in the Debt Financing  Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) negotiate  definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained  therein or on other terms no less favorable to Parent
and Merger Sub and  (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent in  such definitive agreements that are within its
control. In the event that all  conditions applicable to the Financing
Commitments (other than in connection  with the Debt Financing, the
availability or funding of any of the Equity  Financing) have been satisfied
in Parent's good faith judgment, Parent shall use  its reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing  such Financing
to fund the Financing required to consummate the Merger on the  Closing Date
(including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders  and  other
Persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing). In the event  any 
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions  contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use
its reasonable  best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources  on terms no less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent
and Merger Sub (as  determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as
promptly as practicable  following the occurrence of such event. Parent and
Merger Sub shall keep the  Company reasonably apprised of material
developments relating to the  Financing.

 

 

(c)  Parent  shall  not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or
grant any waivers of, any  condition or other material provision under the
Financing Commitments without  the  consent of the Company if such
amendments, modifications or waivers would impose  new or additional
conditions or otherwise amend,  modify or waive any of the conditions to the
receipt  of the  Financing  in a  manner that would be reasonably  likely
to cause any material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions set  forth
in Article VIII. Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
one or more Debt Financing  Commitments may be superseded at the option of
Parent and Merger Sub after  the  date hereof but prior to the Effective
Time by new debt financing commitments  (the " _New  Financing Commitments_
")  which  replace existing Debt Financing Commitments; _provided_ , 
that  the terms of the New Financing Commitments shall not (A) impose new
or  additional conditions to the receipt of the Financing as set forth in the
Debt

Financing  Commitments in any material respect or (B) be  reasonably likely
to cause any material delay in the satisfaction of the  conditions set forth
in Article VIII.  In such  event, the term " _Financing  Commitments_
" as  used  herein shall be deemed to include the Financing Commitments
that are not so  superseded at the time in question and the New Financing
Commitments to the  extent then in effect.

 

 

(d)  In  no  event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates (which for
purposes of this Section  7.9(d) shall be deemed to include each direct or
indirect investor or potential  investor in Parent, or any of WLG's, Parent's

exclusive basis), or (ii) engage any bank or investment  bank  or other
provider of financing other than Deutsche Bank AG and its Affiliates  and
Goldman Sachs Credit Partners and its Affiliates on an exclusive basis  (or

Merger or the other transactions  contemplated hereby, _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  following the No-Shop Period Start Date, Parent may
engage one additional  provider of debt financing and one additional

sources or other Representatives who have not been  provided any such
information prior to the date hereof, other than as set forth  in the Equity
Financing Commitments, as in effect on the date hereof.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates can take any of the  actions otherwise
prohibited by the preceding sentence with respect to up to  an  aggregate of
$50 million of equity investments or equity financing to entities  or persons
who (i) are not principally involved in the private equity business  or (ii)

contemplated hereby. No action shall be taken pursuant to the immediately 
preceding sentence that would violate Section 7.12 of this Agreement. Parent 
shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the foregoing covenant.

after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company  shall, and with respect to
the 6 ¾% Notes shall cause Kerzner International  North America, Inc.  ("
_KINA_ ")  to,  commence offers to purchase and related consent
solicitations with respect  to  all of the outstanding aggregate principal

(the " _6  ¾%  Notes_" and,  together with the Convertible Notes, the "
_Notes_ ")  and  the Convertible Notes on such terms and conditions as are
reasonably acceptable  to Parent and the Company (including the related
consent solicitations,  collectively, the " _Debt  Tender Offers_ ")  and 
Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. Promptly following

trustee (the  " _6  ¾%  Notes Indenture_")  and  (ii) the Indenture,
dated as of April 5, 2004, between the Company and The  Bank  of New York
Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the " _Convertible  Notes Indenture_
" and,  together with the 6 ¾ Notes Indenture, the " _Indentures_ "), 
reflecting the amendments to such indentures consented to in the Debt Tender 
Offers, which supplemental indentures shall become operative concurrently
with  the Effective Time, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the  trustees under the Indentures to promptly enter into such supplemental 
indentures, as applicable. The Company shall provide, and shall cause its 
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their 
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation requested by Parent 
in  connection with the Debt Tender Offers. The closing of the Debt Tender
Offers  shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the
parties shall  use  their reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender
Offers to close on the  Closing Date. Concurrent with the Effective Time, and
in accordance with the  terms of the Debt Tender Offers, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation  to  accept for purchase and purchase the Notes
properly tendered and not properly  withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offers and
provide to the Surviving Corporation  cash in an amount sufficient to fund
such purchase, including any applicable  premiums, and all related fees and
expenses. Parent shall reimburse, or cause  its Affiliates to reimburse, the
Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket fees  and expenses (including any
consent fees paid but only to the extent consented  to by Parent) incurred
pursuant to this Section 7.10. The Debt Tender Offers  and  other actions
taken in connection therewith shall be conducted in accordance  with the
terms of the applicable Indentures and all applicable rules and  resolutions
of the SEC and other applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything  to  the
contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, neither 
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) make any
cash  expenditures or (ii) take any action that could obligate the Company or
any  of  its Subsidiaries to repurchase any Notes or incur any additional
obligations  to  the holders of the Notes prior to the consummation of the
Debt Tender  Offers. ****

 

 

Section  7.11. _Confidentiality  Agreements_.  Parent  acknowledges on
behalf of its Affiliates and each investor in Parent party  to  any
Confidentiality Agreement or the confidentiality agreement dated February 
5,  2006, among SK, HBK, WLG and the Company that such Affiliates and
investors  continue to be bound by such Confidentiality Agreements (including
any "standstill" provisions therein), and the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree  that this Agreement does not in any manner modify or limit the
Company's or such  Affiliate's rights under such agreements. For purposes of
Sections 7.11 and 7.12  of this Agreement, Parent acknowledges that it is an
affiliate of WLG for  purposes of the Registration Rights and Governance
Agreement dated July 3,  2001  among, inter alia, the Company and WLG.

 

 

Section  7.12. _Management_.  In no  event shall Parent or any of its
Affiliates (which for purposes of this Section  shall be deemed to include
each direct investor in Parent) enter into any  arrangements with any member
of the Company's management or any other Company  Employee (other than SK or
HBK) on terms that prohibit or restrict such member  of management or such
Company Employee from discussing, negotiating or entering  into any
arrangements with any third party in connection with a transaction  relating
to the Company or its Subsidiaries or seek to do so.   Parent  shall cause
its Affiliates to comply with the foregoing covenant.

Section  7.13. _Vesting  of Company Equity Awards_.  As  promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 15 days from the date of this 
Agreement), the Company shall take such actions as may be reasonably
required  to  irrevocably amend the terms of the Company Equity Awards to
provide that to  the  extent that a "change of control" (as defined in the
applicable Company Stock  Plan or in any applicable agreement, notice or
letter evidencing the grant  of a  Company Equity Award) shall occur with
respect to any Company Equity Awards  as a  result of the consummation of a
Superior Proposal that results in the  termination of this Agreement, any
such Company Equity Awards that are unvested  as of the effective time of
such Superior Proposal (the " _Superior  Proposal Effective Time_ ") 
shall  become fully vested (and, in the case of Company Options and Company
SARs,  immediately exercisable in full) and all restrictions on such Company
Equity  Awards shall lapse, in each case not later than the earlier to occur
of (a)  the  expiration of the six-month period immediately following such
Superior Proposal  Effective Time and (b) a holder\'s Qualifying Termination
(as defined in the  applicable Company Stock Plan), provided that (1) such
Company Equity Awards  are  still outstanding at (and have not terminated
prior to) the relevant time,  and  were not terminated at the Superior
Proposal Effective Time in consideration  for  the payment of any amount
required pursuant to the provisions of the applicable  Company Stock Plan
(including Section 14(a)(ii) of the Company 2003 Stock  Incentive Plan or the
Company 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as applicable) or  any  applicable
agreement, notice or letter evidencing the grant of such Company  Equity
Award, (2) such Company Equity Awards have not yet become fully vested  or 
exercisable prior to the relevant time and (3) such amendments shall
expressly  be conditioned upon the consummation of a Superior Proposal that
results in  the  termination of this Agreement and shall be of no effect if
such Superior  Proposal is not consummated.

TERMINATION

 

 

Section  9.1. _Termination_.  This  Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior  to  the Effective Time

of the Company):

 

 

(a)  by  mutual  written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub,  on  the other hand;

 

 

(b)  by  either  the Company or Parent, if:

 

 

(i)  the  Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before December 31,
2006 (the " _End  Date_ ")  unless  the failure of the Effective Time to
occur by such date is principally the  result of, or caused by, the failure
of the party seeking to exercise such  termination right to perform or
observe any of the covenants or agreements  of  such party set forth in this
Agreement;

 

 

(ii)  if  any  Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 8.1(c)
shall be in effect  and  shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall  not be available to any party
whose breach of any provision of this Agreement  is  the principal cause of
or resulted in the application or imposition of such  Restraint; or

 

 

(iii)  at  the  Company Shareholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof at
which this Agreement  has been voted upon, the Company shareholders fail to
approve this Agreement  by  the Requisite Shareholder Vote;

 

 

(c)  by  the  Company, if:

 

 

(i)  a  breach  of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of Parent  or  Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which would cause  any  of the conditions set forth in Sections
8.3(a) or (b) not to be satisfied,  and  such breach is incapable of being
cured by the End Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company is not
then in material breach of this Agreement;

 

 

(ii)  at  any  time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Requisite  Shareholder Vote, the Company receives a Company
Acquisition Proposal and

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

the  Board  of Directors (acting through the Special Committee if such
committee still  exists, or otherwise by resolution of a majority of its
Disinterested Directors)  shall have concluded in good faith that such
Company Acquisition Proposal  constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to the foregoing clause  unless: (A) the Company shall have complied in all
material respects with  Section 7.4 of this Agreement; (B) the Company
concurrently pays the Termination  Fee payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a);
and (C) the Board of Directors of the  Company concurrently approves, and the
Company concurrently enters into, a  definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; or

 

 

(iii)  at  any  time prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Cooperation Agreement is  breached in a manner that materially impairs the
Company's ability to take the  actions described in Section 7.4(a) of this
Agreement, and the breaching party  has been given reasonable notice of such
breach and a reasonable opportunity  to  cure such breach prior to the No-
Shop Period Start Date;

 

 

(d)  by  Parent  or Merger Sub, if:

 

 

(i)  a  breach  of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of the  Company set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
which would cause any  of  the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or (b)
not to be satisfied, and  such  breach is incapable of being cured by the
End Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
then in material breach of this Agreement; 

 

 

(ii)  the  Board  of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (A)
shall have effected  a  Recommendation Withdrawal, or publicly proposed to
effect a Recommendation  Withdrawal, or (B) shall have approved or
recommended to the shareholders of  the  Company a Company Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger, or shall have  resolved to effect the
foregoing; or

 

 

(iii)  the  Company shall have willfully and materially breached the terms
of Section 7.4  of  this Agreement in any respect adverse to Parent and
Merger Sub.

Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, at or  prior to the time of
termination in the case of a termination pursuant to  Section 9.1(c)(ii) or
as promptly as possible (but in any event within four  Business Days)
following  termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section  9.1(d)(ii)(B) or Section 9.1(d)(iii).  

 

(b)  In  the  event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section  9.1(d)(ii)(A) and, at any time after the date of this Agreement
and prior  to the  event giving rise to Parent's right to terminate this
Agreement under Section  9.1(d)(ii)(A), a Company Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced  or otherwise communicated or made known to any
executive officer or director  of  the Company (or any person shall have
publicly announced, or communicated  or  made known a bona fide intention,
whether or not conditional, to make a Company  Acquisition Proposal), then
the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination  Fee  as promptly as

 

 


 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

Table  of Contents

 

 


 

possible  (but in any event within four Business Days) following termination
of this  Agreement.

 

 

(c)  In  the  event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to  Section 9.1(b)(iii) under circumstances in which the
obligations under the  Voting Agreement and the Istithmar Equity Rollover
Commitment to vote in favor  of the Merger Agreement have been satisfied in
all material respects, and,  at  any time after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Company Shareholder  Meeting, a Company Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly announced  or  otherwise communicated or made known
to any executive officer or director of  the  Company (or any person shall
have publicly announced, or communicated or made  known a bona fide
intention, whether or not conditional, to make a Company  Acquisition
Proposal) prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, and, if within  12 months
after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters  into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Company 
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same as that originally announced 
or  consummated), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee,
less  the  amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent by the
Company, on  the  date of such execution or consummation ( _provided_  
that  solely for purposes of this Section 9.2(c), the term "Company
Acquisition  Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of
Company  Acquisition Proposal contained in Section 7.4 except that all
references to  30%  shall be deemed references to 50%).

 

 

(d)  In  the  event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to  Section 9.1(b)(iii) (or could have been terminated under
such section) under  circumstances in which (i) the obligations under the
Voting Agreement and  Istithmar Equity Rollover Commitment to vote in favor
of the Merger Agreement  have been satisfied in all material respects and
(ii) the Termination Fee is  not  then payable pursuant to this Section 9.2,
then the Company shall pay to Parent  as promptly as possible (but in any
event within four Business Days) following  receipt of an invoice therefor
all of Parent's and Merger Sub's actual and  reasonably documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable  legal fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their  respective Affiliates on
or prior to the termination of this Agreement in  connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount  shall not be
greater than $12,000,000 (" _Parent  Expenses_ ");  _provided_   that the 
existence of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee
subsequently  to become payable pursuant to Section 9.2(c) shall not relieve
the Company  of  its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this
Section 9.2(d);  and  _provided,_ _further_   that the  payment by the
Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.2(d) shall  not relieve
the Company of any  subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 9.2(c)  except to the extent indicated in such Section 9.2(c).

 

 

(e)  Any  amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b),
9.2(c) or 9.2(d)  shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account  designated by Parent.

 

 

(f)  The  Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.2 are  an  integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that without  these agreements Parent and Merger Sub would not
have entered into this  Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 9.2 do not  constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to

pay  Parent any amounts due to Parent pursuant to this Section 9.2 within the
time  periods specified in this Section 9.2, the Company shall pay the costs
and  expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by
Parent  in  connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit,
taken to  collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such
unpaid amounts  at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in  _The  Wall Street Journal_ ,  calculated on a daily basis
from the date such amounts were required to be  paid  until the date of
actual payment.

 

 

Section  9.3. _Effect  of Termination_.  If this  Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith  become null and void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part  of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or  Affiliates hereunder,
except (i) Sections 7.3(a)(last sentence), 7.11, 7.13,  9.2, 9.3, 10.1, 10.3,
10.6, 10.11 and 10.13 will survive the termination hereof  and (ii) with

not  take  any such action unless previously authorized by the Special
Committee, or  otherwise such action shall be taken by resolution of a
majority of its  Disinterested Directors. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid if set  forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound  thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights
or remedies shall not  constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

 

 

Section  10.6. _Successors  and Assigns_.  The  provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit  of  the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided that  no  party
may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or  obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto  (and
any purported assignment without such consent shall be void and without 
effect), except that Parent may assign all or any of its rights and
obligations  hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such assignment shall relieve
the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. 

 

 

Section  10.7. _Governing  Law_.  This  Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of  the  State of Delaware (except
that the IBCA shall apply to the Merger).

 

 

Section  10.8. _Counterparts;  Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. 
This  Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any number
of  counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
if  the  signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement  shall become effective only when actually signed by each party
hereto and each  such party has received counterparts hereof signed by all of
the other parties  hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or
shall confer upon  any  Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder or with  respect hereto, except as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 7.5.  Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
following the Effective  Time  the provisions of Article II shall be
enforceable by holders of Ordinary  Shares, Company Options, Company SARs or
Company RSUs.

 

 

Section  10.9. _Severability_.  If any  term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable  of  being enforced by virtue of
any Law, or due to any public policy, all other  conditions and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full  force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions  contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any  party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid,  illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto  shall negotiate  in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent  of  the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the 
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

 

Section  10.10. _Entire  Agreement_.  This  Agreement, together with the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Cooperation  Agreement, the Voting Agreement,
the Istithmar Equity Rollover Commitment  (but  only with respect to those
provisions relating to the voting of Ordinary  Shares)  and the letter,
dated as of the date hereof, from Istithmar to the Company  (the " _Side 
Letter_ "),  constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with
respect to its  subject matter and supersedes all oral or written prior or
contemporaneous  agreements and understandings among the parties with respect
to such subject  matter. None of the parties shall

be  liable  or bound to any other party in any manner by any
representations, warranties  or  covenants relating to such subject matter
hereof except as specifically set  forth herein, in the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Cooperation Agreement,  the  Voting Agreement or the Side
Letter.

 

 

Section  10.11. _Jurisdiction_.

 

 

(a)  Each  party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of (i) any
Delaware State court,  and (ii) any Federal court of the United States
sitting in the State of  Delaware, solely for the purposes of any suit,
action or other proceeding  between any of the parties hereto arising out of
this Agreement or any  transaction contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to
commence any suit, action  or proceeding relating hereto either in any
Federal court of the United States  sitting in the State of Delaware or, if
such suit, action or other proceeding  may not be brought in such court for
reasons of subject matter jurisdiction,  in  any Delaware State court. Each
party irrevocably and unconditionally waives  any  objection to the laying
of venue of any suit, action or proceeding between  any  of the parties
hereto arising out of this Agreement or any transaction  contemplated hereby
in (i) any Delaware State court, and (ii) any Federal court  of the United
States sitting in the State of Delaware, and hereby further  irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in  any  such court
that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court  has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably  consents to
the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts  in  any such
suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof  by 
registered mail to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement,
such  service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of
such  registered mail; provided that nothing in this Section 10.11 shall
affect the  right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by  law.  The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section
10.11 shall not constitute  a general consent to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall  have  no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this Section 10.11. The parties  agree that a final judgment in
any such suit, action or proceeding shall be  conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment  or  in any other manner
provided by law.

 

 

(b)  EACH  PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER  THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND  THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY  HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE  TO A  TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT  OF  OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS 
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, 
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE,  THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE  THE  FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE  IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY  AND  (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION  10.11.

(c)  Parent  and Merger Sub each agree that within 5 Business Days from the
date hereof,  each  shall appoint The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation
Trust Center, 1209  Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware (or such other Person
reasonably acceptable  to the Company), as its authorized agent (the "
_Authorized  Agent_ ")  upon  whom process may be served in any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of  or  based upon this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby which may  be  instituted in any Delaware
State court or any Federal court of the United States  sitting in the State
of Delaware and (ii) agrees that service of process upon  such Authorized
Agent shall be deemed in every respect effective service of  process upon
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, in any such suit or  proceeding.

 

 

(d)  The  Company (i) hereby appoints Kerzner  International North
America, Inc.,  1000  South Pine Island Road, Suite 800,  Plantation,  FL
33324-3907,  as its  authorized agent upon whom process may be served in any
suit, action or  proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement or
the transactions  contemplated hereby which may be instituted in any Delaware
State court or  any  Federal court of the United States sitting in the State
of Delaware and (ii)  agrees that service of process upon KINA shall be
deemed in every respect  effective service of process upon Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, in any  such suit or proceeding. The Company hereby
represents and warrants that KINA  has accepted such appointment and has
agreed to act as such agent for service  of  process, and the Company agrees
to take any and all action, including the filing  of any and all documents
that may be necessary to continue such appointment  in  full force and
effect as aforesaid.

 

 

Section  10.12. _Authorship_.  The  parties agree that the terms and
language of this Agreement were the result  of  negotiations between the
parties and their respective advisors and, as a result,  there shall be no
presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall  be  resolved
against any party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement  shall
be decided without regard to events of authorship or  negotiation.

 

 

Section  10.13. _Remedies_.   (a)  Notwithstanding  any other provision
of this Agreement (including Section 9.2 and  Section 9.3), the parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur,  damages would be difficult
to determine and would be an insufficient remedy  and  no other adequate
remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in the  event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in  accordance with 
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (or any party hereto
threatens  such a breach). It is accordingly agreed that in the event of a
breach or  threatened breach of this Agreement, the other parties hereto
shall be entitled  to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to  enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition  to  any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. Each party  hereto irrevocably waives any defenses based on
adequacy of any other remedy,  whether at law or in equity, that might be
asserted as a bar to the remedy  of  specific performance of any of the
terms or provisions hereof or injunctive  relief in any action brought
therefor by any other party hereto. 

 

(b)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub shall have no  right  to seek monetary damages against the
Company for breaches of representations  and  warranties contained in
Article IV of this Agreement to the extent that any  of  the certificates
delivered to the Company by SK, HBK, Mr. Richard Levine  and Mr.  John
