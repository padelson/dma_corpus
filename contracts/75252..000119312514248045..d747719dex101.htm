v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 24, 2014 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among Owens and Minor, Inc., a Virginia corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Mongoose Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Medical Action Industries Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ " and together with Parent and Merger
Sub, collectively, the " _Parties_ ").

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub have each approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
surviving as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, a certain
stockholder of the Company is entering into an agreement with Parent (the "
_Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, subject to the terms thereof, such
stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares of Company
Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and
also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and agreements herein contained, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger; Effective Time of the Merger_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the
surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, in accordance
with provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "). At the Closing, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger prepared and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Company and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

 __Section 1. __2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 9:00 a.m., New York, New York time, on a date to be
specified by the Parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day
after satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with this Agreement) of the last
to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than any such
conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) waived in accordance  with this Agreement on the Closing Date), at the offices of Vinson and Elkins
LLP, 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, unless another date or place is
agreed to in writing by the Parties (such date on which the Closing occurs,
the " _Closing Date_ "). " _Business Day_ " means any day other than a day on
which banks in the State of New York or the State of Delaware are authorized
or obligated to be closed.

Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence under the laws of the
State of Delaware as the surviving corporation (in such capacity, the Company
is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended, subject to _Section 5.6(b)_, in accordance with their
respective terms and applicable law.

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of Merger Sub shall be the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall serve until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

 

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party, any
Person or any holder of any securities of any Person:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully-paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that,
after the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporations common stock.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article II_ , each share of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in clauses (ii) and
(iii) of this _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted
only into the right to receive $13.80 in cash payable to the holder thereof,
without interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such 

 



2  shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist (subject to
the right to receive Merger Consideration as described herein). Each holder
of a Certificate previously representing any such shares or Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, to be paid
in consideration thereof upon the surrender of such Certificates in
accordance with _Section 2.5_, in the case of certificated shares, and
automatically, in the case of Book-Entry Shares.

 

(ii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares
or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor.

 

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of any of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, etc._ In the event of any change in the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, the Merger Consideration to be paid for each share of
Company Common Stock as provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (but
subject to this _Section 2.2_), shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
record holder who has not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and
who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded to be paid fair value of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_, but instead at
the Effective Time the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262
of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and each of such holders Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and provide Parent
with the opportunity to reasonably participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights with respect to any
such demands.

 



3 Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Each of Parent and the
Company shall take all such actions as are reasonably necessary, to cause at
the Effective Time each option for the purchase of Company Common Stock ("
_Company Stock Option_ ") then outstanding, whether or not exercisable,
whether under the Companys 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, 1989 Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan or 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (together,
the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise, to become fully exercisable (if
not then fully exercisable), and such options shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the following consideration: for each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to
the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration payable in respect of a
share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option (such amount in cash as described above, the "
_Option Consideration_ "). Each Company Stock Option with a per share
exercise price in excess of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of a
share of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled without consideration. The
actions described in the preceding sentence shall occur at the Effective Time
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt, the Board or applicable
committee administering each Company Stock Plan shall use their
interpretative authority pursuant to the Company Stock Plans to allow for, and
adopt any resolutions reasonably necessary to effectuate, the foregoing.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay the
Option Consideration to the holders of Company Stock Options as soon as
practicable (and no later than thirty (30) days) following the Closing Date.

 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Restricted Company Common Stock_. Immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the restrictions applicable to each share of
restricted Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (a
" _Company Restricted Share_ ") shall immediately lapse, and, at the Effective
Time, each share of such Company Common Stock shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms hereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Board or applicable committee administering
each Company Stock Plan shall use their interpretative authority pursuant to
the Company Stock Plans to allow for, and adopt any resolutions reasonably
necessary to effectuate, the foregoing.

Section 2.5  _Payment for Securities_.

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent (or another entity
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
and to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders shall become
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. On the Closing Date and prior to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the former holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for payment in accordance with this _Article
II_ through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (the
" _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section
2.1_, in each case, out of the Payment Fund. The

 



4  Payment Fund shall be invested as reasonably directed by Parent. If for any
reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay any of the
amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled
under _Section 2.1_, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all
payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall in any event be liable for prompt payment thereof. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose other than to fund
payments due pursuant to _Section 2.1_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection
with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration and the surrender of
Company Stock Options for the Option Consideration. Any interest or other
income resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or its designee, as the Surviving Corporation directs.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
an outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in a customary form
and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for
payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section 2.1(b)(i)_.

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with the
Letter of Transmittal, completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
(and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly deliver to such holder)
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly
represented by such Certificate and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to an
individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, joint stock
company, trust, estate, joint venture, association or unincorporated
organization, or any other form of business or professional entity (excluding
a Governmental Entity, " _Person_ "), other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.5(b)(ii)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement (A) any holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_ and (B) Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
promptly deliver to each holder of a Book-Entry Share the Merger Consideration
for each of such holders Book-Entry Shares.

 



5 (c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock. After the close of business on the
date of the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (other than
certificates evidencing shares described in clause (ii) of _Section 2.1(b)_)
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates as
provided in this _Article II_.

(d)  _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders or optionholders of the
Company on the first anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time
occurs shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received

shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for
payment of any such amounts.

(e) _No Liability_. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Section 3.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except (i) as set

the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to the date hereof (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") and (ii) as disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents filed by the Company since June 13, 2013 (but excluding any
forward-looking disclosure set forth in any risk factor section, any
disclosures in any section that constitutes a forward-looking statement and
any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are non-
specific, predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature), the Company

business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified and in good standing to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or
the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties and other assets, makes
such qualification necessary, other than where the failure so to qualify or be
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its certificate of
incorporation (the " _Company Certificate of Incorporation_ "), and its
amended and restated bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") as well as the similar
organizational documents of each Subsidiary. The respective jurisdictions of

identified on _Schedule 3.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. A "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any occurrence, condition, change,
development, circumstance, event or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate with all other occurrences, conditions, changes, developments,
circumstances, events or effects, (i) is, or would reasonably be expected to
be, materially adverse to the condition (financial or otherwise), business,
assets or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any of the following

development, circumstance, event or effect resulting from or relating to
fluctuations in the value of currencies; (D) any occurrence, condition,

circumstance, event or effect resulting from or relating to the announcement
or pendency of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (F) any change
in the trading prices or trading volume of the Companys capital stock (it
being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to
such change that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a "Company
Material Adverse Effect" may be taken into account in determining whether
there has been a "Company Material Adverse Effect"); (G) any change in
accounting requirements or principles imposed upon the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or any change in law, regulation
or rule or the interpretation thereof in each case arising after the date of

resulting from or relating to actions taken by Parent or any of its

Company to meet internal or analysts expectations or projections (it being
understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
failure that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of a "Company
Material Adverse Effect" may be taken into account in determining whether
there has been a "Company Material Adverse Effect"); and (J) compliance by the
Company (directly or indirectly) with any of the terms of this Agreement;
except, with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), to the extent that such
occurrence, condition, change, development, circumstance, event or effect is

whole, as compared to other companies operating in the industries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate or (ii) prevents or materially delays or
impairs the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. " _Subsidiary_ " means, with

application for a waiver of the minimum funding standard with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan has been submitted; (ii) no liability (other than for
contributions made to such plan or premiums paid to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ")) under Title IV of ERISA has

instituted proceedings to terminate any such plan or made any inquiry which
would reasonably be expected to lead to termination of any such plan, and no

or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such plan;
(v) neither the Company nor any member of its Controlled Group has engaged in
any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 of ERISA; and (vi)

4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any member

Treasury Department guidance.

(vi) No Employee Benefit Plan exists that, as a result of the execution of

proceeding by the Department of Labor, the PBGC, the Internal Revenue Service
or other governmental agencies are pending, threatened or in progress

Adverse Effect.

 

(viii) There are no material unfunded benefit obligations that have not been
properly accrued for in the Companys financial statements or disclosed in

in breach or default under any Company Contract nor, to the knowledge of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement, is any other party to any such

regulation enacted under state or federal laws in the United States (with the
exception of Section 203 of the DGCL (" _Section 203_ ")), nor any takeover-
related provision in the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, would (i)
prohibit or restrict the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, any related agreement or the Certificate of Merger or
its ability to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of invalidating or voiding this
Agreement, or the Certificate of Merger, or any provision hereof or thereof,
or (iii) subject Parent or Merger Sub to any impediment or condition in
connection with the exercise of any of its rights under this Agreement, the
Voting Agreement or the Certificate of Merger. The Company does not have any
stockholder rights plan in effect. Assuming the accuracy of the

Exchange Act and that has not been so disclosed.

with jurisdiction over the operations of the Company or any of its

of its debts and that the present fair saleable value of its assets will not
be less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its debts as
they become absolute and matured); (B) such Person will have adequate capital

33 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 4.2(a)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Vote, in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal advisors and financial advisors) constitutes or reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal was
not solicited after the date hereof by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise
result from a breach of  _Section 4.2(a)_, the Company may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 4.2_, (i) furnish information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive to such person than the provisions of the

has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person, and (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that in connection with the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would
be (or would be reasonably likely to be) inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under Delaware law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board shall
not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement under _Section 7.1(d)_ with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has complied in all material respects
with this _Section 4.2_, (ii) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in
writing, at least four (4) Business Days before taking that action, of its
intention to do so in response to an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal (in which case such notification shall have attached
thereto the most current version of any proposed agreement or a detailed
summary of the material terms of any such proposal and the identity of the
offeror) and (iii) during such four-Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that any Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute
a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal (taking into account any
changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent following
the notice provided pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)(ii)_) (it being understood
that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of the
Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal
shall require a new written notification from the Company and the Company
shall be required to comply against with this  _Section 4.2(c)_, except that
references to the four (4) Business Day period shall be deemed references to a
two-Business Day period).

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b) and (c) of this _Section 4.2_, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) notify Parent
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, such notice to include the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal, including draft agreements or term sheets submitted in
connection therewith (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably
detailed description of such

 



34  Acquisition Proposal), including any modifications thereto. The Company
shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written
material sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any
person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries
not to, enter into any Contract with any person subsequent to the date
of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such information
to Parent.

(e) Nothing contained in this  _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any
such disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Board, in connection with such communication, publicly reaffirms
the Company Recommendation, and (ii) in no event shall the Company or the
Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action
prohibited by _Section 4.2(b)_.

 

(f) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ inquiry, contract,
proposal, offer or indication of interest relating to any transaction or
series of related transactions (other than transactions with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries) involving: (i) any merger, business combination,
amalgamation, share exchange, recapitalization, consolidation, liquidation or
dissolution involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any direct
or indirect acquisition by any Person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) of any business or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including capital stock of or ownership interest in any
Subsidiary) that generated 20% or more of the Companys consolidated net
revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
for the preceding twelve months or that represents 20% or more of the
consolidated assets (based on fair market value of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole immediately prior to such transaction, or any
joint venture, license, lease or long-term supply agreement having a similar
economic effect; or (iii) any acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) by any Person or "group" of 20% or
more of the voting stock of the Company or any tender or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 20% or
more of the voting stock of the Company. " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of
such term changed from 20% to 50%), that in the good faith determination of
the Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors and after taking into account relevant legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of such proposal (including, but not limited to, any break-
up fee, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions and timing to
consummation, form of consideration and financing terms) and the Person or
group making such proposal, would, if consummated in accordance with its
terms, result in a transaction that is (A) more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer
or otherwise) and (B) reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set
forth in the offer.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 5.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_. Each of the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement
(including the preliminary Proxy Statement) and any amendment or supplement to
the preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable a preliminary Proxy Statement (but
in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall furnish such
preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent and give Parent and its legal counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review such preliminary Proxy Statement prior to
filing with the SEC and shall accept all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith. The Company shall notify
Parent of the receipt of any comments of the SEC staff with respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to
Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable copies of all written
correspondence between the Company or any representative of the Company and
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. If comments are received from the
SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to the comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form
to be cleared by the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and its legal
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review any amendment or supplement
to the preliminary Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall
accept all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in
connection therewith. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with such
information in its possession as may be required to be included in the Proxy
Statement or as may be reasonably required to respond to any comment of the
SEC staff. After all the comments received from the SEC have been cleared by
the SEC staff and all information required to be contained in the Proxy
Statement has been included therein by the Company, the Company shall file the
definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed (including by electronic delivery if permitted) as promptly as
practicable thereafter to its stockholders of record, as of the record date
established by the Board.

 

Section 5.2 _Access to Information_. Subject to Antitrust Laws, the Company
shall afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, at
reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, employees,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and to their books, records, contracts and documents and shall furnish
reasonably promptly to Parent and its Representatives such information
concerning the Companys and its Subsidiaries business (including financial,
operating and other data), properties, assets, contracts, records and
personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf
of Parent. Each of Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any
unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. With
respect to any person, " _Representatives_ " shall mean, collectively, such
persons

 



36  officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, agents, legal
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section 5.2_, the Company shall not be
required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish
information to Parent or any of its Representatives to the extent that such
information is subject to an attorney/client or attorney work product
privilege or that such access or the furnishing of such information is
prohibited by law or an existing contract or agreement (it being agreed that
the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information
to be provided in a manner that does not cause such jeopardization or
contravention). The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of March 11, 2014
between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and, subject to _Section
7.5_, shall apply to all information furnished thereunder or hereunder and any
other activities contemplated thereby.

 

Section 5.3 _Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall call, hold and convene
a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption of this Agreement, to
be held as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Subject
to an Adverse Recommendation Change expressly permitted pursuant to _Section
4.2(c)_ or this _Section 5.3_, (i) the Board shall recommend that the
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
(the " _Company Recommendation_ ") at the Companys stockholders meeting and
the Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders
of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) the
Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board has
recommended that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this
Agreement at the Companys stockholders meeting. The Board shall not (i)
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify
or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation or
(ii) adopt, approve or recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the
adoption of any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses (i) or
(ii) being referred to herein as a " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");
_provided_ that, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Vote, the Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change only if the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors,
that (A) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under Delaware law and (B) if
such Adverse Recommendation Change is made in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company has complied with _Section 4.2(c)_; _provided_ that no
Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to an Acquisition
Proposal and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(d)_ unless the Board determines that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal. In any case in which the Company makes an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 4.2_, unless this
Agreement is terminated, (1) the Company shall nevertheless submit this
Agreement to a vote of its stockholders and (2) the Proxy Statement and any
and all accompanying materials (including the proxy card (which shall provide
that signed proxies which do not specify the manner in which the shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto are to be voted shall be voted "FOR"
adopting this Agreement), the " _Proxy Materials_ ")) shall be identical in
form and content to Proxy Materials that would have been prepared by the
Company had no Adverse Recommendation Change been made, except for appropriate
changes to the disclosure in the Proxy Statement stating that such Adverse
Recommendation Change has been made. If the Company has complied with its
obligations pursuant to _Section 4.2_, the Company may adjourn or postpone
the Companys stockholders meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the

 



37  Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the
time for which the Companys stockholders meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct business at such meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no adjournment may be to a date on or after three Business Days prior to the
date set forth in _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_.

Section 5.4 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to the Premerger
Notification Rules or other applicable Antitrust Laws to which _Sections
5.4(b)_ and _5.4(c)_ , and not this _Section 5.4(a)_, shall apply, promptly
following the execution of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall (i)
proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities all
authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications, registrations,
declarations and filings that are necessary in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall diligently
and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the
prosecution of, such matters and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain all required consents, approval or waivers from third parties (other
than Governmental Entities), including under any Material Contract as may be
necessary in order to consummated the transaction contemplate by this
Agreement.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall make all pre-merger notification
filings required under the HSR Act pursuant to the pre-merger notification
rules identified therein (the " _Premerger Notification Rules_ "). Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings
under any Premerger Notification Rules. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and
the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt
expiration of any applicable waiting period under any Premerger Notification
Rules. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
respond to and comply with any request for information from any Governmental
Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating any
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraining
trade or abusing a dominant position or requiring a notification of this
transaction pursuant to an Antitrust Law, HSR Act or merger control
regulation or regime (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of
any state of the United States, the European Commission, or any other
competition authority or court of any jurisdiction to enforce Antitrust Laws
(" _Antitrust Authority_ "). Subject to applicable law and instructions from
any Governmental Entity, Parent and the Company shall keep each other
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from any Governmental Entity, including
promptly furnishing the other with notices or other written communications
received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with
respect to such transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



38 (c) Parent shall take all action necessary (and which Parent is lawfully
capable of taking) to obtain the expiration of any applicable waiting period,
obtain any clearance or approval and to prevent any Antitrust Authority or
other Person, as the case may be, from filing any action with a Governmental
Entity, which, if the Antitrust Authority or other Person prevailed, would,
permanently or temporarily restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger beyond the Termination Date, including
entering into an agreement to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of
assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries; (ii) terminate existing relationships and contractual rights
and obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries;
(iii) terminate or create any relevant venture or other arrangement; (iv)
create any relationship and contractual rights and obligations of the Company
or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; or (v) effectuate any other
change or restructuring of the Company or Parent (and, in each case, to enter
into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any
of the foregoing) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "). Parent or Merger Sub must
offer any Divestiture Action to an Antitrust Authority such that all
applicable waiting periods expire and all clearances and approvals are
obtained prior to the Termination Date. In the event that any action is
threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Premerger
Notification Rule or other Antitrust Law, Parent shall take such action,
including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or
resolve such action. Parent shall be entitled to direct (after consultation
with the Company) any Antitrust Authority or other Person relating to any of
the foregoing. Neither Parent nor Company shall initiate or participate in
any meeting or communication with an Antitrust Authority or Governmental
Entity relating to the Antitrust Laws without the participation of the other
Party, unless such participation is prohibited by the Antitrust Authority or
Governmental Entity. The Company and its Subsidiaries will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with obtaining any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers with respect to the Antitrust Laws, _provided_ that Parent will in
good faith consider any views or input provided by the Company with respect to
such matters. In addition, in the event that any permanent or
preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate,
modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation
prior to the Termination Date.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this Agreement
that may be to the contrary, including _Section 5.4(c)_, (1) neither Parent
nor the Company shall be required to take any Divestiture Action that is not
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger, (2) the Company shall not agree
to take any Divestiture Action without the consent of Parent and (3) Parent
shall not be required to take (pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or any other
provision of this Agreement) any action (including a Divestiture Action) to
the extent such action (including a Divestiture Action), individually or in
the aggregate with all other actions (including Divestiture Actions), would
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the combined
businesses of Parent, the Company and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



39 Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2015, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide (x) each of the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who, as of the Effective Time, remains in the
active employment of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the
" _Company Employees_ ") with base salary and an annual cash incentive target
opportunity that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the
Company Employees in the aggregate with employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those employee benefits (excluding defined
benefit pension, retiree medical and equity-based compensation) provided to
Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in
accordance with its terms, each Employee Benefit Plan and all obligations
thereunder including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement (either alone or in combination
with any other event, including termination of employment); _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any such arrangement in accordance with its terms, and Parent
hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger constitutes
a "change of control" or a "change in control" or similar term, as the case
may be, for all purposes under the Employee Benefit Plans listed on _Schedule
5.5(b)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
(including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting,
benefit accruals (other than for purposes of any defined benefit pension
plan) and early retirement subsidies, each Company Employees service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with
the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary)
shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates
to the same extent such service was credited under similar Employee Benefit
Plans prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Surviving Corporation to, waive any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Affiliates in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by
each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying
such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time.

 



40 (e) The Company will provide final copies of 280G calculations with respect to
employees, directors, independent contractors and stockholders of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with the underlying assumptions and documentation on which
such calculations are based) no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing.

(f) At the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with a true and accurate
list of all "employment losses" as that term is used in the WARN Act at the
Company or any of its Affiliates that occurred in the ninety (90) calendar
days preceding the Closing Date, showing each employees name, position, date
of separation, employer name, facility, operating unit and reason for
separation from employment (the " _Employment Loss List_ "). Provided that the
Employment Loss List is supplied to Parent, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide any required notice under the WARN Act, and
to otherwise comply with the WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting the Company Employees
(including as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) and occurring from and after the Effective Time. Parent shall
not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to,
take any action on or after the Effective Time that would cause any
termination of employment of any employees by the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries that occurs on or prior to the Effective Time to require that
notice have been given under the WARN Act for any such employment
terminations. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to
provide any required notice under the WARN Act, and to otherwise comply with
the WARN Act with respect to any such plant closing or mass layoff affecting
Company Employees and occurring prior to the Effective Time.

(g) The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any current or former employees, directors, or
independent contractors of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this
_Section 5.5_. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and
the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit
plans or to continue the employment of any specific person, nor shall any
provision herein be construed as an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan.

Section 5.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement, indemnification agreement or otherwise,
from and after the Effective Time, from the Effective Time until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any
Employee Benefit Plan of the

 



41  Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against
all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including
attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the
indemnifying party (not to be unreasonable withheld, conditioned or delayed)
of or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Employee
Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise or
by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity
whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, at
or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all
Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or
in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person in
accordance with the constituent documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries). Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification
under this _Section 5.6_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the
failure so to notify shall not relieve a Person from any liability that it may
have under this  _Section 5.6_ except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such Persons position with respect to such claims) and shall
deliver to Parent and the Surviving Corporation any undertaking required by
applicable law, but without any requirement for the posting of a bond or any
other terms or conditions other than those expressly set forth herein.

(b) From the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation such that the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation would contain provisions less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
former or present directors and officers than as are currently set forth in
the Companys certificate of incorporations and bylaws. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor any
indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its directors,
officers or employees existing immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Parent shall (or with Parents consent, the Company may) cause to be put
in place and shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time a
"tail" insurance policy with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable
as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
Parent shall not be obligated to expend, nor shall the Company be permitted to
expend, more than a single payment amount for such six (6) year period in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums for the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company to purchase such "tail" insurance.

 



42 (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.6_. The provisions of this  _Section 5.6_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties
and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense
advancement pursuant to this _Section 5.6_, and his, her or their respective
heirs and representatives.

Section 5.7 _Agreement to Defend_. In the event any claim, action,
suit, investigation or other legal or administrative proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced that questions the validity
or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in
connection therewith, each of the Parties shall cooperate and use its
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of any such claim, action, suit, investigation or other legal or
administrative proceeding against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Parties shall consult with
each other Party before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, give each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any such press release or other public statements,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as such Party may reasonably conclude may
be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system. The Parties agree that the initial press release
to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the Parties.

Section 5.9 _Advice of Changes; SEC Filings_. Subject to compliance with all
applicable laws, the Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall confer on a
regular basis with each other, report on operational matters and shall
promptly advise each other orally and in writing of any change or event
having, or which would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide each
other (or their respective counsel) copies of all filings made by such Party
or its Subsidiaries with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision of the operations of each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



43 Section 5.10 _Conveyance Taxes_. Each of the Company and Parent shall (a)
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp
Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all
applications or other documents regarding any applicable exemptions to any
such Tax or fee, and (c) pay any such Tax or fee which becomes payable by it
on or before the due date therefor.

 

Section 5.11 _Investigation by Parent and Merger Sub; No Other Representations
or Warranties_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made its
own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
businesses and operations, and Parent and Merger Sub have requested such
documents and information from the Company as each such party considers
material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In connection with
such investigation, Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives have received
from the Company or its representatives certain other estimates, projections
and other forecasts for the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain
estimates, plans and budget information. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets; that Parent
and Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties; that Parent and Merger
Sub are each taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and
budgets so furnished to them or their representatives; and that Parent and
Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause all of their respective Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates or any other Person acting on their behalf to not) assert
any claim or cause of action against the Company or any of the Companys
direct or indirect partners, directors, officers, employees, agents,
stockholders, Affiliates, consultants, counsel, accountants, investment
bankers or representatives with respect thereto, or hold any such Person
liable with respect thereto.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set forth in _Section
3.1_ of this Agreement, the Company has not made and shall not be deemed to
have made any representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that
none of the Company, any holder of the Companys securities or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives, makes or has made any representation
or warranty to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their representatives or
Affiliates with respect to:

(i) any projections, forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available
to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives or Affiliates; or

 

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives or Affiliates, except to the extent and as expressly covered

Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional)
to make an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within twelve months after

49  satisfied because there exists any final and nonappealable order, decree,
ruling, injunction or other action (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger by any Antitrust Authority, then Parent shall pay to the Company
the Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by the Company. If the Termination Fee shall be payable
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as a result of a termination of
this Agreement by the Company, the Termination Fee shall be paid no later than
three Business Days after notice of termination of this Agreement, and if the
Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as a result of a termination of this Agreement by Parent, the
Termination Fee shall be paid on the date of termination of this Agreement.

 

(e) In no event shall either Parent or the Company be entitled to receive more
than one payment of the Termination Fee.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the
case of fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement, in the
event that the Termination Fee becomes payable in accordance with _Section
7.3(d)_, then payment to Company of the Termination Fee shall be Companys
sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any and all losses or
damages of any nature against Parent and Merger Sub and each of their
respective former, current and future directors, officers, employees, agents,
general and limited partners, managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates and
assignees and each former, current or future director, officer, employee,
agent, shareholder, general or limited partner, manager, member, shareholder,
Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent

connection herewith (other than Confidentiality Agreement), and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or damage
suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the
Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
(whether intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise, and upon
payment of such Termination Fee no Parent Party shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

(g) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In the event that the Company or Parent shall fail to pay
the Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by such other party (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of
any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest
on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the
date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.

Section 7.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards, may, to the
extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any

termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_, Parent

Section 8.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties has been represented by counsel of its choice
throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of said
independent counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the Parties shall be deemed
the work product of the Parties and may not be construed against any Party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement
against any Party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly
waived.

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
that such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or that such items are
material to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be. The
headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule are inserted for convenience only and
shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or 

 



52  a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and Parent
Disclosure Schedule are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained
in _Sections 3.1_ and _3.2_ merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an
item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be
deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other
representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to
such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule with
respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross
reference thereto; _provided_ that the disclosure in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall only be an exception to, or disclosure for the purposes of,
the first sentence of _Section 3.1(g)_ to the extent specifically referenced
on _Schedule 3.1(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Parties hereto
agree that any information contained in any part of the Company SEC Filings
shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
the Companys representations and warranties if the relevance of that
information as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a Person who
has read that information concurrently with such representations and
warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) disclosed.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed
to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or
items.

 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Schedules, Articles, Sections,
subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement
unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any
Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are
for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections,
subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the
language contained therein. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereunder" and "hereof" and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited.
The words "this Section," "this subsection" and words of similar import,
refer only to the Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur.
The word "including" (in its various forms) means "including, without
limitation." Any reference to a law shall include any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and any reference to any law, regulation, rule,
agreement, certificate or bylaw in this Agreement shall be a reference to such
law, regulation, rule, agreement, certificate or bylaw as amended. Pronouns
in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and
include any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined
herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and
vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include
the singular and plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such
defined terms.

 

Section 8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by electronic means), all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when two or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

 



53 Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents and
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Following the
Effective Time, the provisions of (a) _Section 5.6_ shall be enforceable by
the Persons referred to therein and their respective heirs and representatives
and (b) each holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to enforce the
provisions of _Article II_ to the extent necessary to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Article II_.
Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement is
not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof.

CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE SOLELY IN RESPECT OF THE

JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION
WITH SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN  _SECTION
8.3_ OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW SHALL BE VALID AND
SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT 

 



54  SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS

AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III) SUCH PARTY

entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it,
including monetary damages) to seek and obtain (a) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. No Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as
a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.8_, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 8.9 _No Remedy in Certain Circumstances_. Each Party agrees that,
should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this
Agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any Party
to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent
herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent
action or the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this
Agreement shall terminate.

Section 8.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of each of the other Parties; _provided_ that each of Parent and Merger Sub
may assign, each in its own discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent without the prior written consent of the Company,
but such assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by each of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this _Section 8.10_ shall
be void _ab initio_.

 

Section 8.11 _Joint Liability_. Each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement made by any of or both of Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement
shall be deemed a

 



55  representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent and Merger
Sub jointly and severally and all liability and obligations relating thereto
shall be deemed a joint liability and obligation of Parent and Merger Sub.

Section 8.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors at any
time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by law
would require the further approval by such stockholders without first
obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.13 _Waiver_. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder.
