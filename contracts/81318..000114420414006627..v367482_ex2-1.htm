SECTION 3.05 _Dissenting Shares_. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Dissenting Shares_ " means shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock held immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time by
a holder of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (each, a "
_Company Stockholder_ "), who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent
thereto in writing) and with respect to which demand to the Company for
purchase of such shares is duly made and perfected in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and not subsequently and effectively withdrawn or forfeited.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.04(c) or any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration at or
after the Merger Effective Time (and at the Merger Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist), but shall entitle the holder
thereof to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to holders pursuant to the DGCL, unless and until the holder of such
Dissenting Shares withdraws his or her demand for such appraisal in
accordance with the DGCL or becomes ineligible for such appraisal. If a holder
of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw his or her demand for such appraisal or
shall become ineligible for such appraisal (through failure to perfect or
otherwise), then, as of the Merger Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever last occurs, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as provided in Section 3.04 and in accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

(a) The Company shall give Pyramid (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands.

  



  

SECTION 3.06 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Pyramid shall appoint an
agent, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to act as disbursing
agent (the " _Disbursing Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (the " _Certificates_ "). At or prior
to the Merger Effective Time, Pyramid Delaware shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Disbursing Agent in trust for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders (i) certificates representing the shares of Pyramid
Delaware Common Stock (or make appropriate alternative arrangements if
uncertificated shares of Pyramid Delaware Common Stock represented by a book
entry will be issued) sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration, and (ii) as
needed, cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of issuing fractional shares
of Pyramid Delaware Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.06(e).

(b) Promptly after the Merger Effective Time, Pyramid Delaware shall
cause the Disbursing Agent to mail to each individual, corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, association, joint venture,
unincorporated organization, trust or any other entity, including
a governmental authority (each, a " _person_ "), who was a record holder as
of the Merger Effective Time of a Certificate which immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock, and whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.04, a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent, and which shall be in such form and
shall have such other customary provisions as Pyramid Delaware may reasonably
specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender to the Disbursing Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter
of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Disbursing Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
paid promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and such
Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. If payment is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of Pyramid Delaware that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 3.06, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Excluded
Shares and other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive, as and when payable
hereunder, the applicable amount of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.04.

  



  

(c) From and after the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Merger Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement or by applicable law. All Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock previously represented by such Certificates. If, after the Merger
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Pyramid Delaware or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificates shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Article III. At the close of business on the
day of the Merger Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company shall be
closed.

  



  

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Pyramid Delaware, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Pyramid Delaware may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Vested Company Restricted Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article III.

  



  

(e) No fraction of a share of Pyramid Delaware Common Stock shall be
issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Pyramid Delaware Common Stock in
connection with the Merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of Pyramid
Delaware Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from
Pyramid Delaware an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) such
fraction, by (y) the average closing price of one share of Pyramid Common
Stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, as reported on the NYSE MKT.

(f) At any time after 180 days after the Merger Effective Time,
Pyramid Delaware shall be entitled to require the Disbursing Agent to deliver
to it any Merger Consideration which had been deposited by Pyramid or Pyramid
Delaware, as the case may be, with the Disbursing Agent and not disbursed in
exchange for Certificates. Thereafter, holders of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall look only to Pyramid Delaware
(subject to the terms of this Agreement and abandoned property, escheat and
other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of the Certificates held by
them. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two years
after the Merger Effective Time (or immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect thereof would otherwise escheat or become the property
of any governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect of such
Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Pyramid Delaware, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Pyramid Delaware, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of
such share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

  



  

(g) Pyramid Delaware and the Disbursing Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  



  

(h) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective
Time, the shares of Pyramid Delaware Common Stock shall be changed or
proposed to be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of
the occurrence of or record date with respect to any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration (as such term is
defined below in Section 3.06(i).

upon the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock that are deemed Dissenting Shares immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time.

Agreement by Pyramid or Merger Subsidiary or the consummation by Pyramid or
Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than such
Consents which, if not made or obtained, as the case may be, would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Pyramid
Material Adverse Effect and would not prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(e) The Board of Directors of Pyramid has approved the Merger and
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such
approval is sufficient to render inapplicable to the Merger and this Agreement

CCC to the extent, if any, such provisions are applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. No other
state takeover, control share, fair price or similar statute or regulation
applies to or purports to apply to Pyramid with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

SECTION 5.13 _Tax Matters_. Neither Pyramid nor any of
Pyramid's subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action that would
prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

  



  

(a) The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with this
Agreement, there are no other written or oral agreements relating to the
Merger other than those expressly referred to in this Agreement, and Pyramid
Delaware will obtain control of the Company as defined in Section 368(c) of
the Code for Pyramid Delaware voting Common Stock.

  



  

(b) In connection with the Merger, no shares of Company Common Stock
will be acquired by Pyramid, Pyramid Delaware or a Related Person (as such
term is defined below) for consideration other than shares of Pyramid Delaware
Common Stock, except for payments to holders of Dissenting Shares, if any,
and any cash paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Pyramid Delaware
Common Stock. In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4),
(5), and (7), for purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Related Person_
" means, (i) a corporation that, immediately before or immediately after a
purchase, exchange, redemption, or other acquisition of Company Common Stock
or Pyramid Common Stock, as the case may be, is a member of an Affiliated
Group (as defined below) of which the Company or Pyramid, as applicable, (or
any successor corporation thereto) is a member; or (ii) a corporation in which
the Company or Pyramid, as applicable, (or any successor corporation
thereto), owns, or which owns with respect to the Company or Pyramid, as
applicable, (or any successor corporation thereto), directly or indirectly,
immediately before or immediately after such purchase, exchange, redemption,
or other acquisition, at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50% of the total value of
shares of all classes of stock, taking into account for purposes of this
clause (ii) any stock owned by 5% or greater stockholders of the Company or
Pyramid, as applicable, (or any successor thereto) or such corporation, a
proportionate share of the stock owned by entities in which the Company or
Pyramid, as applicable, (or any successor thereto) or such corporation owns
an interest, and any stock which may be acquired pursuant to the exercise of
options. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Affiliated Group_ "
means one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership
with a common Pyramid corporation, but only if: (i) the common parent owns
directly stock that possesses at least 80% of the total voting power, and has
a value at least equal to 80% of the total value, of the stock in at least one
of the other corporations, and (ii) stock possessing at least 80% of the
total voting power, and having a value at least equal to 80% of the total
value, of the stock in each corporation (except the common parent) is owned
directly by one or more of the other corporations.

(c) Pyramid is a publicly traded company and its value is determined
on that basis. The Merger Consideration was negotiated by the parties on an
arm's length basis. Pyramid believes, based on the volume weighted average
closing price of Pyramid Common Stock over the fifteen trading days prior to
the date of this Agreement, that the fair market value of the Merger
Consideration received by each stockholder of the Company will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock exchanged in the Merger.

  



  

(d) Other than cash paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of
Pyramid Delaware Common Stock, neither Pyramid nor any Related Person has any
plan or intention to redeem or otherwise reacquire, directly or indirectly,
any shares of Pyramid Delaware Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

  



  

(e) Pyramid has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan
or intention to adopt such a plan.

  



  

(f) Neither Pyramid nor any Related Person owns, nor has it owned
during the past five years, any shares of stock of the Company. Neither
Pyramid nor any Related Person has caused any other person to acquire stock
of the Company on behalf of Pyramid or a Related Person, and will not
directly or indirectly acquire any stock of the Company in connection with the
Merger, except as described in this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Pyramid has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or
property to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by
the Company) for less than full and adequate consideration and has not made
any loan to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by
the Company) in anticipation of the Merger.

  



  

(h) There is no intercompany indebtedness existing between Pyramid,
Merger Subsidiary and the Company that was or will be issued, acquired, or
settled at a discount in connection with the Merger.

  



  

(i)   Pyramid, Pyramid Delaware, and Merger Subsidiary will each pay
its expenses incurred in connection with or as part of the Merger. Pyramid
and Pyramid Delaware have not paid and will not pay, directly or indirectly,
any expenses (including transfer taxes) incurred by any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with or as part of the Merger or any
related transactions. Pyramid and Pyramid Delaware have not agreed to assume,
nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability,
whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(j)   Any compensation paid to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock who enter (or have entered) into employment, consulting or
noncompetitive contracts, if any, with Pyramid or Pyramid Delaware, as the
case may be, (a) will be for services actually rendered or to be rendered,
(b) will be commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at
arm's length for similar services, and (c) will not represent consideration
for the surrender of the shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger.

  



  

(k) Following the Merger, Pyramid Delaware will continue the
historic business of the Company or use a significant portion of its assets in

SECTION 6.18 _Brokers and Finders_. The Company has not entered into
any contract with any person that may result in the obligation of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation to pay any investment banking fees, finder's
fees or brokerage fees in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company has provided to Pyramid a true, correct and complete copy
of any and all engagement or retention agreements with financial advisors or
other advisors, to which the Company is a party and which are related to the

SECTION 6.19 _Production and Reserves_. Netherland, Sewell and
Associates, Inc., whose report as of July 31, 2013 and dated August 28, 2013
(the " _Reserve Report_ ") provided to Pyramid, was as of the date of such
report, and is, as of the date hereof, an independent reserve engineer and
acts as independent reserve engineer with respect to the Company. The
information underlying the estimates of reserves of the Company and its
subsidiaries contained in Reserve Report, which information was supplied by
the Company to Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc., for purposes of
reviewing the Reserve Report and estimates of the Company and preparing the
letter of Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc., including production and
costs of operation, was true and correct in all material respects on the dates
such estimates were made and such information was supplied and was prepared
in accordance with customary industry practices. Other than (i) the
production of reserves in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) the
intervening price fluctuations, the Company is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect in its
proved reserves in the aggregate, or the aggregate present value of estimated
future net revenues of the Company or the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows therefrom, as described in the Reserve Report and
reflected in the reserve information as of the respective dates such
information is given.

SECTION 6.20 _Tax Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the
Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

  



  

(a) The Merger will be carried out strictly in accordance with this
Agreement, the Company is not a party to any other written or oral agreements
regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in this Agreement,
and Pyramid Delaware will obtain control of the Company as defined in Section
368(c) of the Code in exchange for Pyramid Delaware voting Common Stock.

  



  

(b) Pyramid is a publicly traded company and its value is determined
on that basis. The Merger Consideration was negotiated by the parties on an
arm's length basis. The Company believes, based on the volume weighted average
closing price of Pyramid Common Stock over the fifteen trading days prior to
the date of this Agreement, that the fair market value of the Merger
Consideration received by each stockholder of the Company will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock exchanged in the Merger.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Merger Effective Time and in connection with or
anticipation of the Merger, (i) none of the shares of Company Common
Stock will be redeemed, (ii) no extraordinary dividends will be made with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock, and (iii) none of the shares
of Company Common Stock will be acquired by the Company or any Related Person.

  



  

(d) The Company and Company Stockholders will each pay their
respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger.

  



  

(e) Any compensation paid to the Company Stockholders who enter (or
have entered) into employment, consulting or noncompetitive contracts, if
any, with Pyramid or Pyramid Delaware, as the case may be, (a) will be for
services actually rendered or to be rendered, (b) will be commensurate with
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services,
and (c) will not represent consideration for the surrender of the shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger.

  



  

(f)   No debt of the Company is guaranteed by any Company
Stockholder.

  



  

(g) The Company owns no stock of Pyramid.

  



    

43 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(h) No assets of the Company have been sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of which would prevent Pyramid Delaware from
continuing the historic business of the Company or from using a significant
portion of the Company's historic business assets in a business following the
Merger, within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d) or
prevent the Company from holding substantially all of the Company's assets at
and after the Merger Effective Time (ninety percent (90%) of the fair value of
its net assets and seventy percent (70%) of the fair value of its gross
assets, taking into account cash paid to dissenters).

  



  

(i)   The Company is not an investment company as defined in Section
368(a)(2)(F) of the Code. An investment company is (1) a regulated investment
company; (2) a real estate investment trust; or (3) a corporation (i) fifty
percent (50%) or more of the value of whose total assets are stock and
securities, and (ii) eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose total
assets are held for investment. In making the fifty percent and eighty
percent determinations under the preceding sentence, stock and securities in
any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and a parent corporation
shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiary's assets, and a
corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if a parent owns fifty percent
(50%) or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled
to vote, or fifty percent (50%) or more of the total value of shares of all
classes of stock outstanding. For this purpose, "total assets" shall not
include cash and cash items (including receivables) and
government securities.

  



  

(j)   The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title
11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

  



  

(k) There is no indebtedness existing between Pyramid, Merger
Subsidiary and the Company that was or will be issued, acquired, or
settled at a discount in connection with the Merger.

  



  

(l)   The Company has substantial non-tax business purposes and
reasons for the Merger, and the terms of the Merger are the product of arm's
length negotiations.

  



  

(m) The Company will not take, and the Company is not aware of any
plan or intention of any of the Company Stockholders to take, any position on
any Tax Return, or take any other Tax reporting position, that is inconsistent
with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as
defined in Code Section 1313(a)(1)).

  



  

(n) No stock or securities of the Company will be issued to any
Company Stockholder for services rendered to or for the benefit of
Pyramid, Pyramid Delaware or the Company in connection with the Merger
(except to the extent of outstanding Company Restricted Shares or Company
RSUs described in Section 3.04).

  



  

(o) No stock or securities of Pyramid, Pyramid Delaware or of the
Company will be issued to any Company Stockholder for any indebtedness owed
to any Company Stockholder in connection with the Merger.

  



  

(p) No assets were transferred to the Company, nor did the Company
assume any liabilities, in anticipation of the Merger. On the date of the
Merger the fair market value of the assets of the Company will exceed the sum
of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the
assets are subject.

(q) The Company has not distributed the stock of any corporation in
a transaction satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the Code since
February 4, 2009. The stock of the Company has not been distributed in a
transaction satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the Code since
February 4, 2009.

  



  

(r)   During the five-year period leading up to and ending as of the
Merger Effective Time, the Company was a USRPHC.

  



  

(s) At the Merger Effective Time, except as contemplated by Section
3.04, the Company will not have outstanding any warrants,
options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which
any person could acquire stock in the Company.

  



  

SECTION 6.21 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in this Article VI, neither the
Company nor any other person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

commercially reasonable efforts to cause its non-officer employees and other
agents not to (and shall not authorize any of them to) directly or indirectly:

obtaining Pyramid Shareholder Approval, Pyramid may, furnish nonpublic
information regarding such party to, and enter into discussions or
negotiations with, any person in response to a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, which such party's Board of Directors determines in good faith,

Proposal was not solicited in violation of this Section 7.03(a); (B) the

any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business combination,

deemed to be "50%"; and (iii) " _Superior Offer_ " means an unsolicited bona
fide written offer by a third party to enter into (a) a merger,

entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the ultimate company
entity thereof) or (B) in which a person or "group" (as defined in Section

transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of any business or other

reasonably likely to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to
Pyramid's shareholders or the Company's stockholders, as applicable, than the

Material Adverse Effect or a Pyramid Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be, and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant,

and officers' insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for a premium equal

other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Pyramid
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.16. The agreements and covenants
contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which any Company Indemnified Party and any Pyramid Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any

or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
