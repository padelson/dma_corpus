reasonably cooperate and assist Sellers in conducting their review of the
calculations of the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other
Adjustments and Closing Net Working Capital, including by providing reasonable
access to books, records, accountants' work papers (after execution and
delivery by Sellers of any customary agreements required by such accountants)

will be final, binding and conclusive. (ii) If a Dispute Notice is delivered
in accordance with this Section 2.02(d), Sellers and Purchasers shall, during
the forty-five (45) days following such delivery (the "Resolution Period"),
attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement018.jpg) 

13 disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the
amount of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and
Closing Net Working Capital (and all such discussions related thereto shall be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable
similar state rule and evidence of such discussions shall not be admissible in
any future proceedings between the parties). (iii) Any resolution by
Purchasers and Sellers during the Resolution Period as to any item identified
in the Dispute Notice shall be set forth in writing and executed by the
parties and will be final, binding and conclusive. If Sellers and Purchasers
are not able to resolve all disputed items identified in the Dispute Notice
within the Resolution Period, then the items that remain in dispute shall be
submitted to a jointly selected internationally recognized accounting or
consulting firm that is not the independent auditor for any of Sellers, Target
Companies or Purchasers and is otherwise independent and impartial, which firm
shall, within ten (10) days, select an independent and impartial partner from
such firm to act as an expert and not as an arbitrator; provided that if
Sellers and Purchasers are unable to select such accounting firm within thirty
(30) days after the end of the Resolution Period, either Purchasers or Sellers
may request the American Arbitration Association to appoint, within twenty
(20) days from the date of such request, a partner in an independent
accounting firm who is a certified public accountant, independent and
impartial, with significant arbitration experience related to purchase price
adjustment disputes. The individual arbitrator selected by the accounting firm
or the American Arbitration Association, as the case may be, shall be referred
to herein as the "Referee." (iv) If any remaining issues in dispute are
submitted to the Referee for resolution, each of Sellers and Purchasers will
be afforded an opportunity to present to the Referee any material relating to
the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such matters with
the Referee. The Referee shall, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
and not by independent investigation, review the relevant portions of this
Agreement (including Exhibit A hereto), the Closing Statement and the disputed
items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net Working Capital. In
making such calculation, the Referee shall consider only those items or
amounts (and related items that underlie such items and amounts) in the
Closing Statement and Purchasers' calculation of Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments and Closing Net Working Capital as to
which Sellers have disagreed. The Referee shall deliver to Sellers and
Purchasers, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30)
days from the date of engagement of the Referee), a report setting forth its
calculation of the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other
Adjustments and Closing Net Working Capital as applicable; provided that the
Referee shall be instructed that its calculations (i) with respect to each
item in dispute, must be within the range of values established for such
amount as determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by
Sellers in the Dispute Notice and by Purchasers in the Closing Statement and
(ii) must be made in accordance with the standards and definitions in this
Agreement (including Exhibit A hereto). Such report shall be final, binding
and non-appealable upon Sellers and Purchasers. The costs and expenses of the
Referee shall be borne by Purchasers and Sellers in the same proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of such remaining  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement019.jpg) 

14 disputed items so submitted to the Referee that are unsuccessfully disputed
by Purchasers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, as finally
determined by the Referee, bears to the total dollar amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted. For example, should the items in dispute total in
amount to $1,000 and the Referee awards $600 in favor of the Sellers'
position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Purchasers and 40%
of the costs would be borne by Sellers. (v) The final, binding and conclusive
calculations of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Other Adjustments
and Closing Net Working Capital, based either upon agreement or deemed
agreement by Purchasers and Sellers or the written determination delivered by
the Referee, in each case, in accordance with this Section 2.02(d)(v), will be
the final and binding determination for all purposes of this Agreement. (e)
Net Adjustment Amount. (i) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive,
Purchasers shall, within five (5) Business Days of the Net Adjustment Amount
being finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.02(e)(i), pay, or cause to
be paid, the Net Adjustment Amount in immediately available funds to an
account of the Sellers, for further payment to the other Sellers in accordance
with the allocation set forth in Section 5.18(h) of the Disclosure Letter, no
later than two (2) Business Days after such final determination pursuant to
this Section 2.02(e)(i). (ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative,
Sellers shall, within five (5) Business Days of the Net Adjustment Amount
being finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.02(e)(ii), pay, or cause
to be paid, the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount in immediately
available funds to Purchasers by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by Purchasers no later than two (2) Business Days after such final
determination pursuant to this Section 2.02(e)(ii). (f) The process set forth
in this Section 2.02 shall be the exclusive remedy of Sellers and Purchasers
for any disputes related to the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Other Adjustments, Closing Net Working Capital and Net Adjustment Amount,
whether or not the underlying facts and circumstances constitute a breach of
any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement. SECTION 2.03
Closing Deliveries. (a) At the Closing, Purchasers shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to Sellers: (i) the Preliminary Purchase Price by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to accounts of the Sellers as designated in
writing by Sellers to Purchasers no later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date; provided that if the Closing occurs on a day that is not a
Business Day in Canada, the Canadian Purchaser shall make the payment with
respect to the Canadian Purchase Price set forth on Section 2.03(a) of the
Disclosure Letter, plus interest on such amount accruing at an annualized rate

documents, instruments or certificates required to be delivered by Purchasers

documentation as may be reasonably requested by Purchasers to evidence the
transfer of the Equity Interests to Purchasers; (ii) the Reciprocal Transition
Services Agreement, duly executed by Sellers; (iii) the First Amendment to the
DST Application Services Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, in the form
attached hereto at Exhibit C; (iv) the First Amendment to the Output
Application Services and Source Code License Agreement, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D; (v) the Second Amendment to the Master Services
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E; (vi) resignation letters
from each of the directors, executive officers and/or managers of the Target
Companies; (vii) the officer's certificate required pursuant to Section
6.02(e); (viii) following receipt of the Preliminary Purchase Price, a receipt

requirements of Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations, to the
effect that U.S. Seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of

Pacific time, at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four
Times Square, New York, New York, or electronically via email and/or facsimile
on July 1, 2016, assuming the conditions required to be satisfied or waived
pursuant to Article VI have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions
which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date) (subject, in
each case, to the satisfaction and/or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI as of the
Closing Date determined in accordance with this Section 2.04) , unless the
parties mutually agree in writing otherwise (the day on which the Closing

WARRANTIES OF THE TARGET COMPANIES AND SELLERS Except as set forth in the
section of the Disclosure Letter dated the date hereof and delivered by

Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or will on the Closing
Date be, party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except where
failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Target
Companies and each of their respective Subsidiaries are duly qualified and in
good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of
the jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under
lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified and in
good standing that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Target

complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar
governing documents) as in effect on the date hereof for the Target Companies

power and authority and have taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform their obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. This Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements have been
duly executed and delivered by the Sellers and, assuming the authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by Purchasers, constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Sellers enforceable against Sellers in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies. (b) The respective
boards of directors (or equivalent governing body) of Sellers and the Target
Companies have determined that this Agreement is in the best interests of
Sellers and the Target Companies, declared advisable this Agreement and

or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority except as may be

conflict with, or result in a breach of any provisions of, or require any
consent, waiver or approval or result in a default (or give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration or any event that
would constitute a default or give rise to any such right) under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of, any Material Contract to which the Target
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries is subject, (d) result in
the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on any asset of the Target
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than one created by
the Purchasers), or (e) violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to
the Target Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries; except in each
of clauses (b), (c), (d), and (e), where any failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or Permits, any failure to make such filings or any
such modifications, violations, rights, breaches or defaults would not,
individually or in the aggregate, (i) have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise affect the Sellers' or the
Target Companies' ability to satisfy its obligations hereunder. SECTION 3.04
Ownership of Equity Interests. All of the U.S. Interests are beneficially and
of record owned by U.S. Seller, free and clear of all Encumbrances. All of the
Canadian Equity Securities are beneficially and of record owned by Canadian
Seller, free and clear of all Encumbrances. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement023.jpg) 

18 Agreement will convey to Purchasers good title to the Equity Interests,
free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for those created by Purchasers or
arising out of ownership of the Equity Interests by Purchasers and other than
restrictions on transfer of unregistered securities arising under applicable
federal, state or foreign securities Laws. SECTION 3.05 Subsidiaries. (a) Set
forth in Section 3.05(a) of the Disclosure Letter is a list of all of the
capital stock or other equity interest in any Person owned by the Target
Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries. (b) All the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of such Subsidiaries were
duly authorized for issuance and are validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and one of the Target Companies or a Subsidiary of the Target
Companies owns such shares or interests, and the Target Companies or a
Subsidiary of the Target Companies will own such shares or interests
immediately after the Closing Date, in each case free and clear of any and all
Encumbrances other than (i) restrictions on transfer of securities imposed by
applicable securities Laws, (ii) Encumbrances that shall be released on or
prior to the Closing, (iii) Permitted Encumbrances and (iv) Encumbrances
created by Purchasers. SECTION 3.06 Financial Statements. The Sellers have
delivered to Purchasers true and complete copies of the audited combined and
consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, statements of comprehensive
income, statements of changes in owner's equity and statements of cash flows
of the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 (including,
in each case, any notes thereto) (the "Audited Financial Statements"), and an
unaudited combined and consolidated balance sheet and a statement of income of
the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries as of and for the three months
ended March 31, 2016 (collectively, the "Interim Financial Statements," and
together with the Audited Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements").
The Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis for the periods involved and fairly present, in all material
respects, the financial condition of the Target Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended, except (x) as set forth on Section 3.06
of the Disclosure Letter and (y) that the Interim Financial Statements do not
contain footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments. All of the Financial Statements are qualified by the fact that
the Target Companies and the Business have not operated as a separate "stand
alone" entity within Sellers. As a result, the Business received certain
allocated charges and credits as discussed more fully in the notes
accompanying the Financial Statements. Such charges and credits do not
necessarily reflect the amounts which would have resulted from arms-length
transactions or which the Business would incur on a stand-alone basis. SECTION
3.07 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as provided for in Section 3.07 of the
Disclosure Letter, the Business has no Liabilities of a type required to be
reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except (i)
those which are adequately reflected or reserved against in the Financial
Statements, (ii) those which are incurred in the ordinary course of business
since the date of the Interim Financial Statements, (iii) those which  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement024.jpg) 

19 would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) those incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements. SECTION 3.08 Sufficiency of Assets. The assets owned or
leased by the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, or to which
any of the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries have licenses or
possess the legal right to use, which include, but are not limited to, for the
avoidance of doubt, the rights under the Reciprocal Transition Services
Agreement, the Interaffiliate Contracts (covered in Section 3.19 hereof) and
the RE Leases, constitute in all material respects all of the properties,
assets and rights necessary to permit, without regard to the characteristics
of the Purchasers, the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to
conduct, as of the Closing, the Target Companies' Business as it is being
conducted at the date of this Agreement, provided that the foregoing shall not

designated by the Sellers, who may restrict access as Sellers reasonably deem
appropriate, employees and books and records to the extent related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and solely in furtherance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but only to the extent that such
access does not unreasonably interfere with the businesses, operations and
properties of Sellers or the Target Companies and, in any case, only to the
extent related to the Business; provided that the foregoing shall be conducted
at Purchasers' expense and shall not require (1) Sellers or any of their
Affiliates to (v) permit Purchasers' or any of their respective

waiver of any privilege (including the attorney-client and work product
privileges) (provided that the parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a
way to allow disclosure of such books or records to the extent doing so would
not in the good faith belief of Sellers, based on the written advice of
counsel, reasonably be expected to cause such privilege to be undermined with
respect to such information), (3) the auditors and accountants of any of
Sellers or their Affiliates (including the Target Companies and their
businesses) to make any work papers available to any Person unless and until
such Person has provided customary confidentiality, hold harmless or other

37 (b) All information provided or obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including pursuant to subsection
(a) above) shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; provided that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate only in respect of the confidentiality obligations
relating to that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the Business. If this Agreement is, for
any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. (c)
Following the Closing, subject to any applicable Law and contractual
confidentiality obligations, Sellers shall permit Purchasers and their
Representatives and advisors (including attorneys and accountants) to have
reasonable access (including to examine and make copies of, as applicable),

to the Business if, and to the extent, retained by Sellers or their
Affiliates, in each case for any reasonable purpose directly relating to the
Target Companies' Business, including in connection with (i) the preparation
of Purchasers' accounting records or with any audits, (ii) any Action or
Proceeding relating to or referring to the Business or the Target Companies
and their Subsidiaries in any manner, (iii) any regulatory filing or matter,
or (iv) any other bona fide legal or business purpose of Purchasers or their

documented, reasonable and necessary out- of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Sellers in connection with any such request; provided, further,
that Sellers may redact or withhold any portion of any Information that does
not relate to the Business or the Target Companies prior to providing access
thereto to Purchasers or their Representatives or advisors. (d) Following the
Closing, subject to any applicable Law and contractual confidentiality
obligations, Purchasers shall permit Sellers and their Representatives and
advisors (including attorneys and accountants) to have reasonable access
(including to examine and make copies of, as applicable), during regular

Information directly relating to the Business or the Target Companies which
were not retained by Sellers or their Affiliates (including the Target
Companies' records) for any reasonable purpose directly relating to the
businesses of Sellers or their Affiliates, including in connection with (i)
the preparation of Sellers' or their Affiliates' accounting records or with
any audits, (ii) any Action or Proceeding relating to or referring to the pre-
Closing Business or the pre-Closing operations of the Target Companies in any
manner, (iii) any regulatory filing or matter or (iv) any other bona fide
legal or business purpose of Sellers or their Affiliates; provided that
Sellers shall reimburse Purchasers promptly for all documented, reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Purchasers in
connection with any such request. (e) At the Closing, Sellers shall transmit,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to transmit, to Purchasers (or the
Target Companies) all Transferred Books and Records to the extent in the
possession of Sellers and their respective Affiliates or to the extent Sellers

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement043.jpg) 

38 Records. Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall have the right to
retain copies of any Transferred Books and Records for legal, regulatory, tax
or accounting purposes, so long as Sellers or their Affiliates provide at
least one copy of such Transferred Books and Records to Purchasers and keep
such retained Transferred Books and Records confidential. (f) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no party shall be required to disclose any Information if (i)
it believes in good faith that doing so presents a significant risk, based on
advice of counsel (which can be inside counsel), of resulting in a loss of the
ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege or (ii) Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent
thereto; provided that, in the case of clause (i) above, the parties hereto
shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of
such information without resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully
assert a claim of Privilege; provided, further, that Sellers and their
respective Affiliates shall not be required to provide Purchasers or their
Representatives with any information related to the Sale Process or Sellers'
or their Representatives' evaluation thereof, including projections, financial
or other information related thereto other than projections, financial or
other information prepared in the ordinary course of the Business without
being primarily prepared for the Sale Process. (g) Each party shall preserve
and keep all books and records that are retained by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates or are obtained by Purchasers hereunder, as the case may be, which
information relates to the Target Companies or the Business, for a reasonable
period (not less than seven (7) years) after the Closing Date, or for any
longer period as may be (i) required by Law or any Governmental Authority or
(ii) reasonably necessary with respect to the prosecution or defense of any
audit or other legal or regulatory Action that is then pending or threatened
and with respect to which the requesting party has notified the other party as
to the need to retain such books and records. (h) No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation made pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made hereunder by any
party to this Agreement. SECTION 5.03 Provisions Respecting Representation of
the Target Companies. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, managers, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that any of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP or Stinson Leonard Street LLP, (collectively, the "Law Firms") may
serve as counsel to Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Target Companies, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, any of
the Law Firms (or any successor) may serve as counsel to Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates, in connection with any Action or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation or any continued
representation of the Target Companies, and each of the parties hereto (on
their own behalf and on behalf of their respective Affiliates) hereby consents
thereto and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and
each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to
irrevocably waive any conflict of interest arising  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement044.jpg) 

39 from such representation. The parties agree to take the steps necessary to
ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of any Law Firm representing
the Target Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, provided that
such Privilege from and after the Closing shall be controlled by Sellers. As
to any privileged attorney client communications between any Law Firm and the
Target Companies prior to the Closing Date, Purchasers and the Target
Companies, together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any such
privileged attorney client communications in any Action against or involving
any of the parties after the Closing. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between the Sellers, the Target
Companies or their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Law Firm,
on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Target Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Target Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such communications or to the files
of any Law Firm relating to such engagement from and after the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
(i) the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (and not the Target Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Target
Companies or their respective Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to
the extent that files of any Law Firm in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (and
not the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) shall hold such
property rights and (iii) such Law Firm shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the
Target Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between the Law Firm and the Target Companies or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise. This Section 5.03 is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Law Firms. SECTION 5.04 Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation. At all
times from and after the Closing, Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to make available to Purchasers, upon reasonable written request,
their officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents as witnesses to
the extent that (i) such Persons may reasonably be required to testify in
connection with the prosecution or defense of any Action or Proceeding in
which Purchasers may from time to time be involved (except for claims, demands
or Actions or Proceedings between Sellers and Purchasers) in connection with
the Business and the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and
(ii) there is no conflict in the Action or Proceeding between Sellers and
Purchasers, as applicable. Sellers shall be entitled to receive from the

payments for such amounts, relating to disbursements and other out-of-pocket
expenses (which shall not include the costs of salaries and benefits of
employees who are witnesses or any pro rata portion of overhead or other costs
of employing such employees which would have been incurred by such employees'
employer regardless of the employees' service as witnesses) as may be
reasonably incurred and properly paid under applicable Law. At all times from
and after the Closing, Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
make available to Sellers, upon reasonable written request, the Target
Companies' officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents as witnesses
to the extent that (i) such Persons may reasonably be required to testify in

Sellers and Purchasers) relating the conduct of the Business prior to the
Closing and (ii) there is no conflict in the Action or Proceeding between
Sellers and Purchasers, as applicable. Purchasers shall be entitled to receive
from the recipient of such services, upon the presentation of invoices
therefor, payments for such amounts, relating to disbursements and other out-
of-pocket expenses (which shall not include the costs of salaries and benefits
of employees who are witnesses or any pro rata portion of overhead or other
costs of employing such employees which would have been incurred by such
employees' employer regardless of the employees' service as witnesses) as may
be reasonably incurred and properly paid under applicable Law. SECTION 5.05
Employees; Benefit Plans. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall or
shall cause any of their Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) transfer to Sellers or one of their Affiliates (other than the Target
Companies) the employment of any active employee of the Target Companies who
is not an Employee and listed on Section 1.1(b)(i) of the Disclosure Letter,
and (ii) transfer to the Target Companies the employment of any Employee who
is listed on Section 1.1(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter and is not, as of the
date hereof, employed by the Target Companies. (b) During the period
commencing at the Closing and ending on the date which is twelve (12) months
from the Closing (or if earlier, the date of the Employee's termination of
employment with the Target Companies), Purchasers shall, or shall cause the
Target Companies to, provide each Employee who remains employed immediately
after the Closing ("Company Continuing Employee") with: (i) base salary or
hourly wages, target cash bonus opportunities, commissions and equity-based
compensation, which are, in the aggregate comparable, to the base salary,
hourly wages, target cash bonus opportunities, commissions and equity-based
compensation provided to such Company Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing, provided that Purchasers will not decrease base salary or hourly
wages for any Company Continuing Employee, except for any such decreases
determined in good faith, as a result of such Company Continuing Employee's
poor performance or change in duties as determined by Purchasers in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (ii) retirement and
welfare benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the retirement and
welfare benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Purchasers,
provided that nothing herein shall require Purchasers to offer continued
coverage to domestic partners of Company Continuing Employees; (iii) severance
benefits that are comparable to those provided to similarly situated employees
of Purchasers; (iv) vacation and paid time off benefits that (x) for the
period ending on December 31, 2016, are no less favorable than the vacation
and paid time off benefits in effect for such Company Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing and (y) for the remainder of such twelve (12)
month period, are comparable to the vacation and paid time off benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchasers; and (v) other terms
and conditions of employment that are comparable to the terms and conditions
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchasers. (c) With respect to
any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Purchaser Benefit Plans") in which any Company Continuing
Employees will participate effective as of the Closing, Purchasers shall, or
shall cause any of  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement046.jpg) 

41 their applicable Subsidiaries, including the Target Companies, to recognize
all service of the Company Continuing Employees with Sellers and any of
Sellers' Affiliates (including the Target Companies) or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as if such service were with
Purchasers, for vesting and eligibility purposes in any Purchaser Benefit Plan
in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Closing Date; provided, however, such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits. (d) Purchasers shall, or shall cause any of their applicable
Subsidiaries, including the Target Companies, to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations and actively at work requirements otherwise applicable
to Company Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any
Purchaser Benefit Plan that provides health and welfare benefits in which
Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the
Closing, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such
employees as of the Closing under the analogous Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Closing during the portion of
the calendar year prior to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Purchasers, the
Target Companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to a Company Continuing Employee and his or
her eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in each case to the extent
such Company Continuing Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing. (e) Effective as of the Closing, U.S. Purchaser shall, or shall cause
any of its applicable Subsidiaries, including the U.S. Target, to have in
effect a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code (the "Purchaser 401(k) Plan") that will cover United States Company
Continuing Employees after the Closing and accept rollovers of distributions,
including the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing loans to United States
Company Continuing Employees, from the tax-qualified DST Systems, Inc. 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan in which the United States Company Continuing Employees
participate as of the Closing (the "Seller 401(k) Plan"). Effective as of the
Closing, Sellers shall (or shall cause the plan sponsor of the Seller 401(k)
Plan to) (i) fully vest all Company Continuing Employees' accounts under the
Seller 401(k) Plan, and (ii) within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing, contribute to the Seller 401(k) Plan (and credit to the accounts of
Company Continuing Employees thereunder) (A) all matching employer
contributions relating to the Company Continuing Employees' pre-tax and post-
tax contributions, including matching employer contributions, with respect to
the portion of the 2016 plan year that elapsed prior to the Closing Date, and
(B) all discretionary employer contributions relating to Company Continuing
Employees for the 2015 plan year that would have otherwise been credited to
the Seller 401(k) Plan accounts of such Company Continuing Employees had they
continued to be employees of Sellers and their Affiliates. U.S. Seller and
U.S. Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to allow Company Continuing  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement047.jpg) 

42 with outstanding loan balances under the Seller 401(k) Plan to elect to
directly rollover their loans to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan. (f) Purchasers
shall, through the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December
31, 2016, maintain health care and dependent care flexible spending accounts
for United States Company Continuing Employees under Parent's Code Section 125
plan ("Purchasers' FSA"). Purchasers' FSA shall provide that United States
Company Continuing Employees shall participate in Purchasers' FSA and each
such Company Continuing Employee shall be credited immediately following the
Closing Date under Purchasers' FSA with amounts available for reimbursement
equal to such amounts as were credited under the Health Care Flexible Spending
Account and Dependent Care Spending Account components of the DST Systems,
Inc. Code Section Flexible Spending Program ("Sellers' FSA") with respect to
such Person on the Closing Date. Purchasers shall (i) give effect to the
elections made by such Company Continuing Employees under Sellers' FSA for the
remainder of 2016 and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of
the amounts transferred in accordance with the following sentence, process all
claims for reimbursement on and after the Closing Date including claims
incurred before the Closing Date but not yet reimbursed. Sellers shall
transfer cash to Purchasers, in an amount equal to the net aggregate amount of
all Closing Date balances of such Company Continuing Employees under Sellers'
FSA that are credited under Purchasers' FSA, if such amount is positive; and
Purchasers shall pay Sellers a cash amount equal to the net aggregate amount
of all such balances if such amount is negative. Sellers and Purchasers agree
to make reasonable, good faith efforts to implement the provisions of this
Section 5.05(f), including (i) if possible, in the ordinary course consistent
with Parent's past practice with respect to Purchaser Benefit Plans, making
necessary plan amendments, (ii) causing the transfer of any cash amount set
forth in this Section 5.05(f) within thirty (30) days following the Closing
Date, and (ii) Sellers promptly providing Purchasers with information and
documents (and arrange for communications with, and provide directions to,
Sellers' FSA third party administrator(s)) reasonably requested by Purchasers
for Purchasers to comply with Purchasers' obligations set forth in this
Section 5.05(f). (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, after the Closing, Purchasers shall, or shall cause the Target
Companies to, provide for terms and conditions of employment for any Company
Continuing Employee in accordance with applicable Law. (h) From the date of
this Agreement until the Closing, Purchasers shall not communicate with any
Company Continuing Employees, including communications related to
compensation, benefits or other treatment that they will receive in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, unless any such communications have
been reviewed and approved by Sellers in advance of such communications (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). (i) This Section 5.05
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties
to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.05, express or implied, shall
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Section 5.05. Nothing contained herein, express or
implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement. The parties  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement048.jpg) 

43 hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.05
shall not create any right in any Employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with the Target Companies, Purchasers or any of their
respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever. (j) Purchasers shall, and shall cause the Target Companies to, and
each of them hereby does, assume all liability and obligation for, and neither
Sellers nor any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date shall retain any
liability or obligation for severance pay and obligations payable to any
Company Continuing Employee who is terminated by Purchasers or any Target
Company on or after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any
severance obligations for any Employees who, other than as a result of actions
taken by Purchasers, do not become Company Continuing Employees shall be borne
by Sellers. (k) In respect of the Company Continuing Employees, Purchasers
shall use best efforts to comply with the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act and all reporting obligations thereunder. (l) To assist in compliance
with Purchasers' obligations under this Section 5.05, Sellers shall provide to
Purchasers (i) such information as Purchasers may reasonably request to
facilitate the rollover of distributions from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan in accordance with Section 5.05(e), (ii) within thirty
(30) days following the Closing Date (or at such later dates as may be
reasonably requested by Purchasers), an Arrow Master Census U.S. and Canada
report as in 10.1.14 in the Data Room, updated with information correct as of
the Closing Date, and (iii) such additional information as Purchasers may
reasonably request, including, without limitation, information to enable
Purchasers to comply with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and
reporting obligations thereunder. (m) To the extent the Target Companies are
participating employers in any of the Seller Benefit Plans, Sellers shall,
prior to but effective as of the day prior to the Closing or such other date
pursuant to and in accordance with the Reciprocal Transition Services
Agreement, cause the Target Companies to withdraw as participating employers
in such Seller Benefit Plans. (n) Sellers shall take the following action with
respect to its deferred compensation program: (i) outstanding cash awards with
a settlement date of December 1, 2016 and as to which no extended deferral
elections have been made shall be paid by Sellers on the scheduled payment
date of December 1, 2016 or such earlier date as shall be determined by
Sellers and (ii) Sellers shall retain the liability for all cash awards as to
which extended deferral elections have been made with respect to any Company
Continuing Employee listed on Section 1.1(b)(i) of the Disclosure Letter or
former Employee of the Target Companies who is either in pay status or is
entitled to future payments ("Nonqualified Plan Participants"). Purchasers
shall promptly advise Sellers in writing of any Nonqualified Plan
Participant's separation from service on or following the Closing Date, but in
no event later than ten (10) days following such separation from service.
Sellers and Purchasers hereby agree that each Employee, including a
Nonqualified Plan Participant, providing services to Sellers and the Target
Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date and providing services to
Purchasers and the Target Companies after and in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein shall not be  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement049.jpg) 

44 deemed to have experienced a separation from service for purposes of
Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder; provided that, for
the avoidance of doubt, neither Purchasers nor the Target Companies shall be
required to continue the employment of any Company Continuing Employee after
the Closing Date. (o) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Purchasers shall pay to the applicable Company Continuing Employees, through
payroll in the first applicable payroll period after Closing, any and all (i)
annual cash bonus amounts accrued through June 30, 2016 and (ii) the Retention
Amounts, as well as any and all applicable associated payroll Taxes directly
relating to such amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
and all amounts paid to Company Continuing Employees in connection with the
prior sentence shall be accrued as a Current Liability of the Business on the
Closing Statement for purposes of determining the Adjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.02. SECTION 5.06 [RESERVED] SECTION 5.07 Governmental
Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents. (a) Subject to Section 5.07(d) below
with respect to Purchasers, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best

any Governmental Authority, (ii) the contesting and defending of any Actions,
whether judicial or administrative, brought under, pursuant to or relating to
any United States or Canadian antitrust or competition Law challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
enacted by any Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, (iii) the
compliance with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the

impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals. Each party hereto acknowledges that it has made an appropriate
filing of a Notification or Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and shall make
as promptly as practicable, appropriate filings, if applicable, under United
States or Canadian antitrust Laws, and to supply as promptly as practicable to
the appropriate Governmental Authority any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or
applicable United States or Canadian antitrust Laws. (b) Sellers and
Purchasers each shall, upon written request by the other, furnish the other
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates,

Additionally, during such five (5) year period following the Closing Date,
Sellers shall not (i) solicit any then-current customers of the Business with
regard to any of the Prohibited Activities, or (ii) provide or offer to
provide, alone or in combination with other services, any services
constituting any of the Prohibited Activities to any prospective customer of
the Sellers. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that nothing
herein shall prohibit Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries from: (i)
acquiring or investing in any Person, or the assets thereof, if less than ten
percent (10%) of the gross revenue, net revenue or assets of such Person
(based on such Person's latest annual audited consolidated financial
statements) are related to or were derived from any of the Prohibited
Activities; (ii) acquiring or investing in any Person, or the assets thereof,
if ten percent (10%) or more than ten percent (10%) of the gross revenue, net
revenue or assets of such Person (based on such Person's latest annual audited
consolidated financial statements) are related to or were derived from any of
the Prohibited Activities; provided, that, within one year of such
acquisition, Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries enter into a definitive
agreement to divest themselves of all or substantially all of the assets or
operations so acquired that are engaged in any of the Prohibited Activities
(and use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate such transaction as
soon as reasonably practicable thereafter); (iii) acquiring or investing in
securities representing not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
voting power of any Person engaged in any of the Prohibited Activities; or

any of the Prohibited Activities through any employee benefit plan of Sellers
or their respective Subsidiaries. (c) In addition to the foregoing, even
though not a Prohibited Activity, Sellers agree, and agree to cause their
Subsidiaries, for a period beginning at the Closing and continuing until the
date that is five (5) years following the Closing, not to provide Electronic
Presentment Services in the United States and Canada to businesses who are
not, at the time of determination (as of the date of this Agreement or in the
future), clients of Seller or its Subsidiaries who utilize the TA2000
(registered and sub-accounts), TRAC, or Bluedoor platforms, or any successor
platforms thereto (the "Platforms"). For the avoidance of doubt, for a period
beginning at the Closing and continuing until the date that is five (5) years
following the Closing, and subject to the limitations above, Sellers shall
not, and shall cause their Subsidiaries not to, provide Electronic Presentment
Services to any Persons in the United States and Canada who are clients of the
Business at the time of Closing but who do not, as of the Closing Date,
receive Electronic Presentment Services from either Sellers, their
Subsidiaries, or the Business, unless they are also utilizing the Platforms.

billing, account, benefits or other consumer or investor information for which
an electronic presentment fee is charged to the client, and offered as a
separate stand-alone service, or in combination with a printing and mailing
service. For the avoidance of doubt, any Electronic Presentment Services
provided by Seller and its Affiliates are, and would be, ancillary to Seller's
and its Affiliates' other products and service offerings. (d) Neither Sellers
nor their respective Affiliates shall, for a period of five (5) years
following the Closing Date, enter into any arrangement or agreement with
respect to the matters set forth on Section 5.16(d) of the Disclosure Letter.
Nothing in this Section 5.16(d) shall restrict the ability of any Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates, at the request of a customer, to provide
such customer's data to any other third party. The parties agree that the
activities described in the first sentence of this Section 5.16(d) shall be
treated as "Prohibited Activities" for the purposes of Section 5.16(b). (e)
The parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
5.16(a) herein, neither the provisions of Section 5.16(a) nor shall Section
5.16(d) prohibit Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries from (i) performing
under any Contract or Shared Contract or (ii) its obligations under this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Intellectual Property Arrangements,
or the Master Subcontracting Print Arrangements. (f) For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that a Subsidiary of the Seller (other than the Target
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) ceases to be a Subsidiary of the
Seller (whether by divestiture, merger or business combination, so long as
such transactions are at arm's length with unaffiliated third parties), the
provisions of this Section 5.16 shall cease to apply to such Person (or the
surviving entity of such transaction).  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement056.jpg) 

51 (g) The restrictions set forth in this Section 5.16 shall not apply to any
third Person or any of its Affiliates (other than Seller and its Subsidiaries)
that is engaged in the Prohibited Activities or provision of Electronic
Presentment Services at the time such third Person engages in a merger or
business combination with Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(other than the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries), including
the surviving entity of any such transaction. (h) For a period of two (2)
years from the Closing Date, Sellers agree that neither they nor their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent
of Purchasers, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any
Employee; provided, that nothing in this Section 5.16(h) shall prohibit
Sellers or their Subsidiaries from soliciting or hiring any Person pursuant to
general solicitations of employment in any newspaper, magazine, trade
publication, electronic medium or media or from soliciting or hiring any
Person whose employment with Purchasers, the Target Companies or their
Affiliates has terminated other than as a result of actions by the Seller or
its Subsidiaries. (i) For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date,
Purchasers and the Target Companies agree that neither they nor their
Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of the Sellers, directly
or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any Person who, immediately
prior to the Closing was an employee of Sellers or their respective
Subsidiaries; provided, that nothing in this Section 5.16(i) shall prohibit
Purchasers, the Target Companies or their respective Affiliates from
soliciting or hiring any Person pursuant to general solicitations of
employment in any newspaper, magazine, trade publication, electronic medium or
media or from soliciting or hiring any Person whose employment with Sellers or
their respective Subsidiaries has terminated other than as a result of action
by the Purchasers. (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Purchasers or their Affiliates (including through the Target Companies and
their Subsidiaries) may directly compete (including through solicitation,
marketing and selling) with Sellers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates in
the provision of Electronic Presentment Services to any clients, including
current and future clients of Sellers and their Affiliates. (k) In addition,
Purchasers and their Affiliates (including through the Target Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries), may directly compete with Sellers and their
Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the provision of any services, including
printing, mailing, and any other investor communication services. SECTION 5.17

evaluation of the Companies' businesses (including the Business). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchasers hereby acknowledge and
agree that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth
in Article III of this Agreement, (a) none of Sellers, the Target Companies or
their respective Affiliates nor any other Person has made any representation
or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, including any implied warranty or

Section 5.18(b)(iv). (b) Preparation of Tax Returns. (i) Sellers shall prepare

Law. With respect to any Seller Return that is to be filed after the Closing
Date, not later than thirty (30) Business Days (or as soon as is reasonably

number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period as compared to the number of
days in the Post-Closing Straddle Period. (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, Sellers and Purchasers each
acknowledge and agree that, in the preparation of the Tax Returns as required
by Section 5.18(b)(i) and Section 5.18(b)(ii), (a) Sellers and Purchasers
shall each, and shall cause each of their Affiliates, to take the position
that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, all deductions arising in
connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the payment of the Transaction Expenses, and (ii) the payment of the Sellers'
Compensation Expenses (together, the "Transaction Tax Deductions"), in each
case, are properly deductible by either Seller or are otherwise deductible in
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period without regard to (x)
whether the amounts underlying such Transaction Tax Deductions are paid prior
to, on, or following the Closing Date and (y) the identity of the Person
making the payment underlying the applicable Transaction Tax Deduction and (b)
the safe harbor election provided in Internal Revenue Service Revenue

Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (including any of the Target Companies
or their Subsidiaries) actually realizes any Tax benefits in respect of any
such Transaction Tax Deduction, then Purchasers shall promptly after realizing

or as of the Closing Date. (c) Purchasers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on

consent of Sellers or unless required by applicable Tax Law, (i) (a) amend, or
request or permit the amendment of, any Seller Return or (b) apply to any Tax

determination with respect to the Target Companies or their Subsidiaries in

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement060.jpg)

Parties"), shall notify the other Tax Contest Party within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any tax deficiency,
proposed tax adjustment, tax assessment, tax audit, tax examination or other
administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim with respect
to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Target Companies or their Subsidiaries (each
and any of the foregoing, a "Tax Contest") which Tax Contest could reasonably
be expected to affect the obligations of such other Tax Contest Party, or
their Affiliates, with respect to Taxes pursuant to this Agreement. A
Recipient's failure to comply with this notice provision shall not affect such
Recipient's right to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement unless (and
only to the extent that) the other Tax Contest Party is adversely prejudiced
as a consequence of such failure. (i) If a Tax Contest relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, Sellers shall, at their expense,
control the defense and settlement of such Tax Contest and Purchasers, at
Purchasers' expense and with counsel of its own choosing, shall have the right
to participate fully in all aspects of the defense of such Tax Contest;
provided, however, that, if the resolution of such Tax Contest would increase
the Tax liability of Purchasers or any of their Affiliates for any Post-
Closing Straddle Period or Post-Closing Tax Period or otherwise adversely
affect Purchasers or any of their Affiliates, Sellers shall (a) conduct such
Tax Contest diligently and in good faith, (b) consult in good faith with
Purchasers before taking any action in connection with such Tax Contest that

good faith with Purchasers and offer Purchasers a reasonable opportunity to
comment before submitting to any Governmental Authority any written materials

Tax Contest without obtaining the prior written consent of Purchasers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

of all Tax Contests other than those described in Section 5.18(f)(i). Sellers,
at Sellers' expense and with counsel of their own choosing, shall have the

Sellers or otherwise adversely affect Sellers or any of their Affiliates.
(iii) Each Tax Contest Party shall promptly provide to the other Tax Contest
Party copies of all written notices and other documents received from any
Governmental Authority with respect to any Tax Contest (provided that the Tax
Contest Party receiving such notice or other document may redact from such
copies information not reasonably related to or necessary for determining
amounts for which the other Tax Contest Party may be liable hereunder with
respect to such Tax Contest). (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in the event the Entity-Level Purchase Price Allocation, the
Purchase Price Allocation or any of the 338(h)(10) Allocations are disputed by
any Governmental Authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute shall
promptly notify and consult with the other party concerning resolution of such
dispute. (g) Tax Records and Cooperation. The Purchasers and the Sellers (and
their respective Affiliates) shall cooperate with each other in connection
with the filing of any Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other
Proceeding with respect to Taxes, whether for any Pre- Closing Tax Period,
Pre-Closing Straddle Period, Post-Closing Tax Period, or Post-Closing Straddle
Period. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant

provided, however, that Sellers shall not be required to provide any copies of
their consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns under this Section 5.18(g)
or any other provisions of this Agreement. The parties agree (i) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any Target Company
or Subsidiary thereof relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Purchasers or the Sellers any extensions of the statute
of limitations) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) to give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if any of the other parties so
requests, the Purchasers or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records. (h) Allocation of
Purchase Price. The parties agree that the Final Purchase Price shall be
allocated between the U.S. Interests (the "U.S. Purchase Price") and the
Canadian Equity Securities (the "Canadian Purchase Price") as mutually
determined in good faith by the Sellers and the Purchasers (the "Entity-Level
Purchase Price Allocation"). The parties also agree that the purchase and sale
of the U.S. Interests shall be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
the purchase by U.S. Purchaser and the sale by U.S. Seller of all of the
assets of U.S. Target. Not later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing

Purchase Price Allocation, Purchasers shall notify Sellers in writing if they

parties shall make a good faith attempt to reach an agreement. If the parties
are unable to reach agreement regarding the Entity-Level Purchase Price
Allocation, all unresolved items that remain in dispute shall be submitted to
a jointly selected internationally recognized accounting firm, the costs of
which will be borne equally by the Sellers and Purchasers. Such accounting
firm shall resolve all items in dispute in a manner consistent with Section
5.18(h) of the Disclosure Letter. The proposed allocation as revised to
reflect the resolutions of such accounting firm shall be the Entity-Level
Purchase Price Allocation. Not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Sellers shall provide to Purchasers (i) an allocation of the U.S.
Purchase Price and any liabilities of the U.S. Target and its Subsidiaries
other than Newkirk Products, Inc. (to the extent treated as liabilities for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the assets of U.S. Target (including
the stock of DST Output Electronic Solutions, Inc., DST Mailing Services,
Inc., DST Output East, LLC, DST Output West, LLC, Lateral Group NA, LLC and
Newkirk Products, Inc. and the assets of DST Output Central, LLC) and (ii) an
allocation of the Canadian Purchase Price and any liabilities of Canadian
Target (to the extent treated as liabilities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) among the assets of Canadian Target, each allocation in (i) and (ii)
in a manner that complies with the requirements of the Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"). Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the proposed Purchase
Price Allocation, Purchasers shall notify Sellers in writing if they disagree
with such proposed allocation and, in the event of disagreement, the parties
shall make a good faith attempt to reach an agreement. If the parties are
unable to reach agreement regarding the Purchase Price Allocation, all
unresolved items that remain in dispute shall be submitted to a jointly
selected internationally recognized accounting firm, the costs of which will
be borne equally by the Sellers and Purchasers. The proposed allocation as
revised to reflect the resolutions of such accounting firm shall be the
Purchase Price Allocation. The parties shall cooperate in preparing,
executing, and filing with each Tax Authority all required information
returns, including filing with the Internal Revenue Service all necessary
information returns required by Section 1060 of the Code. The Entity-Level
Purchase Price Allocation and the Purchase Price Allocation shall be final,
conclusive, and binding on each party and Purchasers and Sellers shall each
timely file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Acquisition Statement under
Code Section 1060) and all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in
accordance with such allocations. In the event that the Final Purchase Price
is determined, or any other adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price or
Final Purchase Price for Tax reporting purposes is made under this Agreement
after delivery of the Purchase Price Allocation, Sellers and Purchasers shall
mutually revise the Entity-Level Purchase Price Allocation, the Purchase Price
Allocation and the 338(h)(10) Allocations accordingly. The Purchase Price
Allocation, as finally determined, shall be used in preparing Internal Revenue
Service Form 8883 for purposes of Section 5.18(i) of this Agreement. In the
event that any Tax Authority disputes the Entity-Level Purchase Price
Allocation, the Purchase Price Allocation, or any of the 338(h)(10)
Allocations, Sellers or Purchasers, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
the other party in writing of the nature of such dispute. (i) Section

338(h)(10) Elections, U.S. Seller, Purchasers and their respective Affiliates
shall, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, cooperate with
each other to take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including
filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be
required) otherwise to effect, perfect and preserve the 338(h)(10) Elections

comparable provisions of state or local Tax Law) or any successor provisions;

relevant 338(h)(10) Election among such assets, which allocations shall be
made in accordance with Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any applicable
Treasury Regulations thereunder and in accordance with the Purchase Price
Allocation, and (b) a complete Internal Revenue Service Form 8883 (and any
comparable forms required to be filed under state or local Tax Law) and any
additional data or materials required to be attached to such forms for each of
the respective 338(h)(10) Elections (collectively, the "338(h)(10)
Allocations"). Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the proposed
338(h)(10) Allocations, Purchasers shall notify Sellers in writing if they
disagree with such proposed allocation and, in the event of disagreement, the
parties will make a good faith attempt to reach an agreement. In the event the
parties do not reach an agreement, all unresolved items that remain in dispute
shall be submitted to a jointly selected internationally recognized accounting  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement064.jpg) 

59 firm, the costs of which will be borne equally by the Sellers and
Purchasers. The proposed allocation as revised to reflect the resolutions of
such accounting firm shall be the Section 338(h)(10) Allocations. The
338(h)(10) Allocations shall be final, conclusive and binding on U.S. Seller
and Purchasers (and their respective Affiliates) and U.S. Seller and
Purchasers (and their respective Affiliates) shall (i) be bound by such
allocations for all Tax purposes, (ii) prepare and file all Tax Returns to be
filed with any Governmental Authority (including Form 8883 and Form 8594 filed
with the parties' respective federal income Tax Returns for the taxable year
that includes the Closing Date and any other forms or statements required by
the Code, Treasury Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service or any applicable
state or local Governmental Authority) in a manner consistent with such
allocations and (iii) take no position inconsistent with such allocations in
any Tax Return, any Proceeding before any Governmental Authority or otherwise.
(j) Non-U.S. Operations Covenant. During the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on December 31, 2016, Purchasers shall cause the Canadian
Target to operate its business consistent with past practice and shall not
undertake any actions outside of the ordinary course which would affect the
earnings and profits of the Canadian Target for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. (k) Exclusivity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5.18 (and not those of Article VII),
shall govern the manner in which matters relating to Taxes (including
indemnification related to Losses associated with Taxes and the allocations
referred to in Section 5.18(h) and Section 5.18(i)) are conducted and
resolved; provided, however, that the provisions of Section 7.01, Section
7.04(c), Section 7.04(d),Section 7.04(e), Section 7.04(f), Section 7.04(g),
Section 7.04(h), Section 7.04(i), Section 7.06 and Section 7.07 shall apply
mutatis mutandis. SECTION 5.19 Ancillary Agreements. At the Closing, each of
Sellers and Purchasers shall enter into, or shall cause their respective
Affiliates (as applicable) to enter into, each of the Ancillary Agreements.
SECTION 5.20 Delayed Contracts. (a) Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless and until such consent, approval or
amendment described below is no longer required or has been obtained, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense,
lease, sublease, convey or transfer at the Closing any Contract or any claim
or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom as to which
consent or approval from any Person (including consents and approvals of
Governmental Authorities) to assignment, license, sublicense, lease, sublease,
conveyance or transfer thereof or amendment thereof is required but has not
been obtained as of the Closing Date (such Contract, a "Delayed Contract");
provided, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of any Delayed
Contract or applicable Law, the parties shall treat Purchasers as the owners
thereof for Tax purposes as of the Closing Date; provided, further, that,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, none of Sellers, Purchasers,
nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to commence any litigation or
offer or pay any money or otherwise grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party. Upon obtaining  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement065.jpg) 

60 the requisite consents or approvals, such Delayed Contract shall be
transferred and assigned to Purchasers hereunder without additional
consideration therefor. (b) In the event and to the extent that, prior to the
Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates are unable to obtain a consent, approval
or amendment required to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey
or transfer any Delayed Contract to Purchasers, then following the Closing,
Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to (i) continue to hold, and to the extent
required by the terms applicable to such Delayed Contract, operate such
Delayed Contract in all material respects in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and taking into account the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and solely for the benefit of Purchasers, (ii)
cooperate in any arrangement, reasonable and lawful as to Sellers and
Purchasers, designed to provide to Purchasers or their respective Subsidiaries
the benefits arising under such Delayed Contract, including accepting such
reasonable direction as Purchasers shall request of Sellers and (iii) enforce
at Purchasers' request, or allow Purchasers and their Affiliates to enforce in
a commercially reasonable manner, any rights of the applicable Sellers under
such Delayed Contract against the other party or parties thereto; provided,
that the costs and expenses incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates at
Purchasers' request shall be borne solely by Purchasers. Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Subsidiaries to, without further consideration therefor, pay
and remit to Purchasers promptly all monies, rights and other consideration
received in respect of such performance net of any applicable Taxes.
Purchasers shall pay, perform and discharge fully, promptly when due, all of
the obligations of Sellers or their Subsidiaries in respect of such
performance, and Purchasers shall be responsible for all Assumed Liabilities
related thereto and indemnify the Sellers for all Losses arising out of any
actions (or omissions to act) of Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries arising
out of such performance or taken at the direction of Purchasers or any of
their Subsidiaries. (c) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this
Section 5.20, none of the Sellers nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action that, in the good faith judgment of Sellers would
reasonably be expected to (i) result in a violation of any obligation which
any such Seller or any such Subsidiary has to any third party or (ii) violate
applicable Law. (d) Purchasers acknowledge that certain consents and approvals
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements may be required from certain third parties, and that such consents
and approvals have not been and may not be obtained. Purchasers agree that
Sellers and their Affiliates shall not have any liability whatsoever arising
out of or relating to, the failure to obtain any consents or approvals that
may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or because of the
default under or acceleration or termination of any Contracts or Permits or
other right or obligation, as a result thereof. Purchasers further agree that
no representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation of Sellers contained
herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition to Purchasers'
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of the
failure to obtain any such consent or approval or as a result of any such
default, acceleration or termination.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement066.jpg) 

61 SECTION 5.21 Contracts Adjustment. The parties agree that the Adjusted
Purchase Price is subject to adjustment in respect of the Covered Contracts
(as defined below) for the benefit of the Purchasers as follows: (a) If the
conditions set forth on Section 5.21(a) of the Disclosure Letter are satisfied
with respect to any Covered Contract and the counterparty to such Covered
Contract: (i) takes the actions set forth on Section 5.21(a)(i)(1) of the
Disclosure Letter, then subject to Section 5.21(d), Sellers shall pay
Purchasers an amount with respect to such Covered Contract equal to the amount
set forth on Section 5.21(a)(i)(2) of the Disclosure Letter; or (ii) takes the
actions set forth on Section 5.21(a)(ii)(1) of the Disclosure Letter, then
Sellers shall pay Purchasers an amount with respect to such Covered Contract
equal to the amount set forth on Section 5.21(a)(ii)(2) of the Disclosure
Letter. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment pursuant to clauses
(a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this Section 5.21 in respect of each Covered Contract
shall be subject to a cap equal to the amount set forth on Section 5.21(b) of
the Disclosure Letter. Such cap shall be calculated on a per-Covered Contract
basis, and not in the aggregate. (c) [Reserved]. (d) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event an adjustment is owed to Purchasers pursuant to
Section 5.21(a)(i) with respect to Covered Contract 1, 2 or 3 (each defined on
Section 5.21(i) of the Disclosure Letter), the amount owed by the Sellers
pursuant to Section 5.21(a)(i) will be reduced by the full amount of any
payment owed pursuant to the terms of Covered Contract 1, 2 or 3 to the Target
Company that is the party to such Covered Contract by virtue of terms
described on Section 5.21(d) of the Disclosure Letter. (e) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Purchasers
or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies or any
of their respective Subsidiaries) migrate or otherwise transition any or all
of the customers in the manner set forth on Section 5.21(e)(i) of the
Disclosure Letter (any such customers, in each case, the "Transitioned
Customers"), then the amount of any payment with respect to the adjustment
owed to Purchasers pursuant to Section 5.21(a) will be reduced by the
aggregate amounts for all Transitioned Customers, as set forth opposite such
customers on Section 5.21(e)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter. (f) In connection
with the parties' agreement to adjust the Adjusted Purchase Price as set forth
above, Purchasers agree that they will not (i) induce any counterparty to
terminate any Covered Contract or (ii) inform or otherwise make known the
terms of this Section 5.21 to any counterparty to a Covered Contract. (g)
Prior to Closing, Sellers and Purchasers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any change of control consents required under any customer
agreement, including without limitation the Covered Contracts, provided that
neither party will be required  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement067.jpg) 

62 to expend any money to obtain any such consent. Sellers and Purchasers
shall also work in good faith to develop a plan for Purchasers to meet with
certain mutually-agreed key customers of the Business prior to Closing and
Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to undertake such pre-Closing customer
transition meetings and communications as Purchasers may reasonably request.
(h) Following the Closing, Purchasers will continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents under the Covered Contracts
and will negotiate in good faith with the counterparties to the Covered
Contracts in the ordinary course of business, consistent with Purchasers' past
practices with the customers of its businesses other than the Business. (i)
For purposes of this Section 5.21, Covered Contracts means those Contracts
listed on Section 5.21(i) of the Disclosure Letter. (j) All payments made
under this Section 5.21 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Adjusted Purchase Price for all purposes hereunder (including Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law). (k) Following the Closing, the
receipt of payments made pursuant to this Section 5.21 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Purchasers with respect to the matters addressed
in this Section 5.21. SECTION 5.22 Shared Contracts. (a) With respect to
Liabilities pursuant to, under or relating to a given Shared Contract, such
Liabilities shall, unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this Agreement, be
allocated between Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other hand,
as follows: (i) If a Liability is incurred exclusively in respect of the
Business, such Liability shall be allocated to Purchasers (in respect of the
Business); (ii) If a Liability cannot be so allocated under clause (i) above,
such Liability shall be allocated to Sellers or Purchasers, as the case may
be, based on the relative proportions of total benefit received (over the term
of the Shared Contract remaining as of the Closing Date, measured as of the
date of the allocation) by the Business under the relevant Shared Contract
(such portion allocated to Sellers pursuant to this clause (ii), "Seller
Shared Contract Liabilities"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Sellers,
on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be responsible for
any or all Liabilities arising from its (or its Subsidiary's) breach of the
relevant Shared Contract to which this Section 5.22 otherwise pertains. (b) If
Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Purchasers or any of
their Subsidiaries (including the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries), on
the other hand, receives any benefit or payment which under any Shared
Contract was intended for the other, Sellers and Purchasers will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, deliver such benefit or payment to the other party net of any
applicable Taxes.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement068.jpg) 

63 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that
the Shared Contracts listed on Section 5.22(c)(i) of the Disclosure Letter
shall not be deemed to be primarily related to the Business or otherwise for
the benefit of Purchasers, the Target Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries for any purposes hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the
parties have determined that it is advisable that certain Shared Contracts,
which are identified on Section 5.22(c)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter, be
separated into separate Contracts between the appropriate third party and the
Business. The parties agree to cooperate and provide reasonable assistance
prior to the Closing (with no obligation on the part of either party to pay
any costs or fees with respect to such assistance) in effecting the separation
of such Shared Contracts. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
nothing in this Section 5.22 shall be deemed to apply to or otherwise govern
any arrangement otherwise expressly covered by the Interaffiliate Contracts,
including the Master Subcontracting Print Arrangements. In the event and to
the extent that there shall be a conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and the provisions of any Ancillary Agreement or Interaffiliate
Contract, the Ancillary Agreement or Interaffiliate Contract shall control.
SECTION 5.23 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification. (a) If the
Closing occurs, the Purchasers and the Target Companies agree that all rights
to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any
officer, director or manager of the Target Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case that is an individual (collectively, the "Company
Indemnitees"), as provided in the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
other organizational documents of the Target Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Target
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries after the Closing. The obligations
of the Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries under this Section
5.23(a) shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.23(a) applies without the
consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.23(a) applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.23(a)). If the Closing occurs, Sellers
shall pay all expenses to any Company Indemnitee incurred in successfully
enforcing the indemnity or other obligations provided for in this Section
5.23(a). (b) For six (6) years after the Closing, the Target Companies will
provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date covering each such Person
currently covered by the Target Companies' officers' and directors' liability
insurance policies on terms with respect to coverage not materially less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement
and for an amount not less than the amount set forth on Section 5.23(b) of the
Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that in no event shall the Target
Companies be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 200% of
the current annual premiums paid by the Target Companies for such insurance;
provided, further, that Sellers shall procure such policy and the cost of such
policy shall be equally borne by the Sellers and the Target Companies;
provided, however, that such insurance policy may be a "tail" policy covering
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement069.jpg) 

64 In the event that any Company Indemnitee is entitled to coverage under an
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy pursuant to this Section
5.23(b) and such policy has lapsed, terminated, been repudiated or is
otherwise in breach or default as a result of the Target Companies' failure to
maintain and fulfill its obligations pursuant to such policy as provided in
this Section 5.23(b), the Target Companies shall pay to the Company Indemnitee
such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as the Company
Indemnitee shall have received pursuant to such policy. (c) In the event the
Target Companies and their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Target
Companies or such Subsidiaries (or their respective successors and assigns),
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.23. SECTION 5.24
Provision of Certain Services. Purchasers acknowledge and agree that, as of
the date hereof, the Business receives from Sellers and their Affiliates
certain administrative and corporate services and benefits of a type generally
provided to other businesses and Subsidiaries of Sellers (the "Support
Services"). Sellers and Purchasers acknowledge and agree that, except as
provided in the Ancillary Agreements or other arrangements that expressly
survive the Closing, including the Intellectual Property Arrangements and the
Master Subcontracting Print Arrangements, the Support Services shall cease at
Closing, and all agreements and arrangements (whether or not in writing) in
respect thereof shall terminate as of the Closing Date, with no further
obligation of any party thereto. SECTION 5.25 Parent Undertakings. Without
limiting in any way Section 9.13 of this Agreement, Parent agrees to cause
each of U.S. Purchaser and Canadian Purchaser to perform any and all
agreements, covenants and obligations of such Purchaser and any of its
Subsidiaries under this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements.

representations and warranties that address matters only as of a specified
date, which shall be true and correct as though made at and as of such date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct (without giving regard to any materiality or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications set forth therein) would not, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. (b) Sellers shall have duly performed and complied in all
material respects with all agreements, covenants and obligations required by
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to or on the
Closing Date. (c) There shall not have been an occurrence or nonoccurrence of

Date with the same effect as though made at and as of such date (except those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a specified
date, which shall be true and correct in all respects as of that specified
date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be

by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to or on the
Closing Date. (c) Sellers shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing

representations and warranties contained in Article III (other than those
referenced in clauses (a) and (b) to the proviso to this sentence) and Article
IV of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full
force and effect for a period from the date hereof until the General Survival
Date; provided that (a) the Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect indefinitely and (b) the
representations and warranties which relate solely to Tax matters contained in

the extent known at such time) and in writing by notice from the non-breaching
party to the breaching party following the Closing and prior to the expiration
date of the applicable survival period shall not thereafter be barred by the
expiration of such survival period and such claims shall survive until finally
resolved. SECTION 7.02 Indemnification by Sellers. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Article VII, from and after the Closing, Sellers shall
jointly and severally indemnify Purchasers against, and shall hold Purchasers
harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or

Sellers contained in this Agreement other than those contained in Section 3.13  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement072.jpg) 

67 (b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed or observed by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, the remedy
for which survives the Closing; (c) all Seller Benefit Plan Liabilities; or

upon, Sellers based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of: (a)
any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Purchasers contained
in this Agreement; (b) the Assumed Liabilities, subject to the express
indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to Section 7.02; (c) any
breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be
performed or observed by Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement (or to be
performed by the Target Companies or their respective Subsidiaries following
the Closing), the remedy for which survives the Closing. SECTION 7.04 Certain
Limitations. The party making a claim under this Article VII is referred to as
the "Indemnified Party", and the party against whom such claims are asserted
under this Article VII is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party." The
indemnification provided for in Section 5.18(a), Section 7.02 and Section 7.03
shall be subject to the following limitations (as applicable): (a) The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as the case may be,
until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under
Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a) exceeds the amount set forth on Section
7.04(a)(i) of the Disclosure Letter (the "Deductible"), in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in
excess of the Deductible; provided, that, the Deductible shall not apply to
the following claims, and the following claims shall not count toward the
Deductible: any claims by the Purchasers on behalf of its Affiliated
Indemnified Parties to the extent based upon or arising or resulting from any
breach of any of the Fundamental Representations. With respect to any claim to
which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under Section
7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as the case may be, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any individual or series of related Losses which do not
exceed the amount set forth on Section 7.04(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter
(the "De Minimis Threshold") (which Losses below the De Minimis Threshold
shall not be counted towards the Deductible). For the avoidance of doubt, the
De Minimis Threshold shall not apply to the Fundamental Representations. (b)
Other than with respect to Losses in connection with the Fundamental Reps, the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement073.jpg) 

68 pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as the case may be, shall
not exceed the amount set forth on Section 7.04(b) of the Disclosure Letter.
(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 5.18(a), Section
7.02 or Section 7.03 in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount
equal to any cash Tax benefit actually realized, calculated on a "with and
without" basis (i.e., assuming that the Loss giving rise to the claim for
indemnification is the last item used on the Indemnified Party's Tax return),
to the extent such Tax benefit is realized in the two years such Loss is
incurred by the Indemnified Party, as a result of such Loss. In the event that
any such Tax benefit is actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent
to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment pursuant
Section 5.18(a), Section 7.02 or Section 7.03 in respect of the Loss to which
such Tax benefit relates (but within the two years such Loss is incurred), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly after realizing such Tax benefit make a
payment to the Indemnifying Party equal to the amount of such Tax benefit. (d)
Other than with respect to Losses in connection with indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.03(b), in no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any punitive, exemplary, incidental, consequential,
special or indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss
of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach
of this Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of
multiple. (e) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to
take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to
remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss. (f) Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, no indemnity may be sought hereunder in
respect of any Losses to the extent such Liability (i) is reserved for or
otherwise reflected in the Financial Statements or the calculations of the
Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Other Adjustments or
Estimated Net Working Capital (as the same may be adjusted pursuant to Section
2.02) or (ii) was taken into account in determining the Net Adjustment Amount.
(g) The indemnification provisions of this Agreement (i) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (other than injunctive relief or specific performance as
contemplated by Section 9.12 or claims for actual and intentional fraud (based
on theories other than concealment or omission)) following the Closing with
respect to any breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty,
agreement, covenant or any other obligation contained in this Agreement, (ii)
shall apply without regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by
reason of set-off, limitation or otherwise and (iii) are intended to be
comprehensive and not to be limited by any requirements of Law concerning
prominence of language or waiver of any legal right under any Law (including
rights under any workers compensation statute or similar statute conferring
immunity from suit). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if
any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the
future, that it may have against Sellers or any of their Affiliates or  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement074.jpg) 

69 Purchasers or any of their Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or
based upon any Law (including any such Law relating to environmental matters
(including Environmental Laws) or arising under or based upon any securities
Law, common Law or otherwise). The obligations of the parties set forth in
Section 5.18(a) and this Section 7.04 shall be conditioned upon the Closing
having occurred. Without limiting the generality of this Section 7.04, in no
event shall any party, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to
claim or seek rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements. Each of the parties hereto expressly waives all
rights under California Civil Code § 1542 (and any similar, comparable, or
equivalent Law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of
common law) as to all released claims. California Civil Code § 1542 provides
as follows: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR
DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING
THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR
HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. The parties hereto intend for the terms of
Section 7.04(g) to apply to any claims covered by the scope described therein
and herein, including those claims which they do not presently know to exist
at this time. The parties hereto understand that the facts upon which they
have based their respective decisions to enter into this Agreement may
hereafter prove to be different from the facts now known or believed by them,
and they hereby accept and assume the risk thereof and agree that this
Agreement shall be and shall remain, in all respects, effective and not
subject to termination or rescission by reason of any such difference in
facts. (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for
which an indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and net of any insurance or
other prior or subsequent recoveries (including under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement agreement or Contract pursuant to
which or under which such Indemnified Party or such Indemnified Party's
Affiliates is a party or has rights) actually received by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right
of indemnification, less related costs and expenses actually incurred in
connection with such recoveries; provided, that the amount deemed to be
recovered under insurance policies shall also be net of any increase in the
premium for such policies to the extent arising out of such Losses or the
claims made related thereto. The applicable Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies the
maximum portion of any Losses of such Indemnified Parties. If the applicable
Indemnified Parties shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to recover
any amounts recoverable under insurance policies and shall not have recovered
the applicable Losses, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the amount by which such Losses exceeds the amounts actually recovered
(subject to the limitations contained herein). If the applicable Indemnified
Parties fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to recover any amounts
recoverable under insurance policies, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall
not be required to indemnify the applicable Indemnified Party for that portion
of any Losses that could reasonably be expected to have been recovered had the
applicable Indemnified Parties used such commercially reasonable efforts.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any party,
its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Ancillary
Agreements.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement075.jpg) 

70 (i) Except as relates to Losses arising out of or related to the Assumed
Liabilities, in no event shall any party have any obligation or liability
under this Article VII arising from or relating to, directly or indirectly,
any legislation or accounting principle not in force on the date hereof (or
any alteration or repeal of any legislation or accounting principle in force
on the date hereof), or which takes effect retroactively, or occurs as a
result of any increase in the rate of Tax in force on the date hereof or any
change in the practices of the relevant Governmental Authority (including
changes in the interpretation of relevant legislation or accounting
principles). SECTION 7.05 Indemnification Procedures. The provisions of this
Section 7.05 shall apply in accordance with their terms except in the case of
any Tax Contest or any other matter relating to Taxes or Tax Returns, which
shall be governed exclusively by Section 5.18. (a) Third-Party Claims. (i) If
any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any
action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding made or brought by any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against
such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party may be
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt (but in any event, within 30
days after it becomes aware of such Third-Party Claim) written notice thereof.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced or otherwise actually
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. (ii) The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party to assume the defense of, any Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and
the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, cooperate in
good faith in such defense. (iii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 7.05(b), it
shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by
it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement076.jpg) 

71 (iv) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such
Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing
of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
may, subject to Section 7.05(b), pay, compromise or defend such Third-Party
Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from
or relating to such Third- Party Claim. Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate
with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the
confidentiality provisions of this Agreement) records relating to such Third-
Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of
actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of
the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of
the defense of such Third-Party Claim. (b) Settlement of Third-Party Claims.
The Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
as provided in this Section 7.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a
Third-Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial
or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in
customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may consent to and accept and agree to such offer. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 7.05(a), it
shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably, withheld,
conditioned or delayed). (c) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party
on account of a Loss which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party prompt (but in any event, within 30 days after it becomes aware of such
Direct Claim) written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 60 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. During such 60-day period, the Indemnified Party
shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Target Companies' premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy
any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such 60-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement077.jpg) 

72 SECTION 7.06 Adjustments to Losses. In calculating the amount of any Loss
for which either party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, to the extent
such Loss is otherwise recovered by a party pursuant to other terms of this
Agreement, the amount of such recovery shall be deducted from the amount owed
in order to prevent the same amount from being paid more than once. SECTION
7.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.
ARTICLE VIII TERMINATION SECTION 8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing: (a) by Purchasers, effective upon
written notice to Sellers, if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Sellers or the Target Companies which has rendered
the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02
impossible, such violation or breach has not been waived by Purchasers, and
the breach has not been cured within 30 days following Purchasers' written
notice of such breach; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.01(a) shall not be available to Purchasers if any
Purchaser is then in material breach of any material representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein; (b) by Sellers, effective upon
written notice to Purchasers, if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Purchasers which has rendered the satisfaction of any
conditions set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.03 impossible, such
violation or breach has not been waived by Sellers, and the breach has not
been cured within 30 days following Sellers' or the Target Companies' written
notice of such breach; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.01(b) shall not be available to Sellers or the Target
Companies if any Target Company is then in material breach of any material
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein; (c) by
Sellers or Purchasers, effective upon written notice, if the Closing shall not
have occurred by December 13, 2016; provided, further, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(c) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall
have been a principal cause of, or shall have otherwise resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; (d) by Purchasers or
Sellers, effective upon written notice, if there shall be in effect a final,
non-appealable order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, that the terminating party shall have fulfilled its
obligations contained in Section 5.07 prior to exercising its right to
termination under this Section 8.01(d); or  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement078.jpg) 

73 (e) by the mutual written consent of Sellers and Purchasers at any time
prior to Closing. SECTION 8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Article VIII, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the
part of any party hereto except: (a) as set forth in this Article VIII and
Article IX and any confidentiality provisions of this Agreement and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive in
accordance with its terms; and (b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party
hereto from liability for any willful and intentional breach of any provision
hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a "willful and intentional" breach
means a material breach that is a consequence of an act or omission knowingly
undertaken by the breaching party with the intent of causing a breach of this
Agreement. ARTICLE IX MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 9.01 Expenses. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein (including Section 5.18 hereof), all costs and
expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred; provided, however,
that Purchasers shall be responsible for all filing and other similar fees
payable in connection with any filings or submissions under the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Laws. SECTION 9.02 Notices. All notices, requests,
consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be

75 thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. This Agreement shall be
construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Letter and Exhibits referred to
herein shall be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to
the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. The specification
of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in Article
III or Article IV is not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or
lower amounts, are or are not material for purposes of this Agreement or any
other Ancillary Agreement, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth of any such amount in any dispute or controversy between or among the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in the Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement. SECTION 9.04 Disclosure. Any
exception or qualification set forth on the Disclosure Letter with respect to
a particular representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be an exception or qualification with respect to all other
applicable representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement to the extent any description of facts regarding the event, item or
matter disclosed is adequate so as to make reasonably apparent or otherwise
make the other parties reasonably aware that such exception or qualification
is applicable to such other representations, warranties or covenants whether
or not such exception or qualification is so numbered. The inclusion of
information in any section of the Disclosure Letter hereto shall not be
construed as an admission that such information is material to the Target
Companies, their respective Subsidiaries or the Business. Prior to the
Closing, Sellers and the Target Companies shall have the right to supplement,
modify or update the Disclosure Letter hereto, provided, that, any such
supplements, modifications, or updates shall have effect solely for purposes
of any claims made by Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates with
respect to Section 8.02(b) and shall not otherwise limit or modify any of the
other rights or potential remedies of Purchasers or any of their respective
Affiliates hereunder. SECTION 9.05 Headings. The headings in this Agreement
are for reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this
Agreement. SECTION 9.06 Severability. If any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. SECTION 9.07 Entire
Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, together with all
exhibits and schedules thereto, the Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement081.jpg) 

76 SECTION 9.08 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder. SECTION 9.09 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in
Section 5.03 and Section 5.23 of this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. SECTION 9.10 Amendment
and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or
supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver
by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver
by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any
failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver,
whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or
after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right,
remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. SECTION 9.11 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial. (a) This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction). (b) ANY LEGAL
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT, THE OTHER ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AND EACH
PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER
DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE
SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY
SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN
AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  

  

 ![](ex21purchaseagreement082.jpg) 

77 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11(c). SECTION 9.12 Specific Performance. The
parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any
other remedy at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that
a remedy of injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for
specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate, and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. SECTION 9.13
Guaranty. Parent hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and absolutely guarantees
any and all of the payment obligations of each of U.S. Purchaser and Canadian
Purchaser under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement. SECTION 9.14
Counterparts. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements delivered by facsimile, e-mail or
other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal
effect as delivery of an original signed copy thereof. SECTION 9.15 Non-
Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim, action,
suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may
only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties
hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein
with respect to such party. No past, present or
