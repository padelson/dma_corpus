Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall thereafter evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (d) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Stock Options_ "), whether vested or unvested, will be converted into a right to acquire such number of currently outstanding, validly issued and fully paid Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with this _Section 1.6(d)_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option so converted will be deemed to constitute a right to acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option, a number of Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole Parent Ordinary Share) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio and the per share exercise price of each such Company Stock Option so converted shall be adjusted by dividing (x) the per share exercise price of each such Company Stock Option by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest Â€0.01. Except as      ##### 

  

    

provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company Stock Options will
continue to be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time except that, upon exercise of such Company Stock
Options, the holders thereof will receive Parent Ordinary Shares held by a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Option Sub_ "). It is the intention
of the parties that the Company Stock Options so assumed by Option Sub
qualify, to the maximum extent permissible following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code, to the extent the Company Stock Options so assumed qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time.    

 (e) _Withholding Taxes_. The Company, and on its behalf Parent and the Surviving Corporation, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of federal, local or foreign Tax law or under any applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.    

 1.7 _Payment Procedures_.   

 (a) _Reservation and Deposit of Cash_.    

 (i) On the Closing Date, Parent shall reserve and make available for payment in accordance with this _Article 1_ the cash amounts payable pursuant to _Section 1.6_ in exchange for all shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, less an amount of cash equal to the Escrow Amount. A portion of the Escrow Amount shall be withheld from each Effective Time Company Stockholder in proportion to that portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration that each such Effective Time Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (without giving effect to any Dissenting Shares) by virtue of the ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 (ii) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount of cash equal to the Escrow Amount, such cash to be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent under on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement. Each Effective Time Company Stockholder shall be deemed to have contributed such stockholderÂ’s pro rata portion of the Escrow Amount relative to that portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration that each such Effective Time Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (without giving effect to any Dissenting Shares) by virtue of the ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 (b) _Surrender of Company Stock Certificates_.     ##### 

  

     

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing (and in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall deliver to each Effective Time Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal and instructions for use of such letter of transmittal in effecting the surrender of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced one or more shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Certificate_ "), all in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (each " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which Parent shall provide prior to the Closing to each Signatory Stockholder and each other Effective Time Company Stockholder who so requests.   

 (ii) As soon as reasonably practicable following the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the Parent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto (and in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the cash amount (without interest) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 1.6_ in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock evidenced by such Company Stock Certificate (less the amount of cash to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holderÂ’s behalf pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_), and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Any Effective Time Company Stockholder who shall deliver the items set forth in this  _Section 1.8(b)(ii)_ to Parent at or prior to the Closing shall receive the amounts such Effective Time Company Stockholder is entitled to receive hereunder on the Closing Date (or the next Business Day) if the Closing occurs after the closing of business of insured banks in the Pacific time zone.   

 (iii) Until surrendered in accordance with _Section 1.7(b)(ii)_, all Company Stock Certificates shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes other than the payment of dividends, to evidence only the right to receive in exchange therefor the cash amount (without interest) payable in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock evidenced thereby pursuant to _Section 1.6_. No portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock formerly evidenced thereby unless and until the holder of record of such Company Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate and the Letter of Transmittal pursuant hereto.   

 (c) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant to  _Section 1.6_ hereof to any Person other than the Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by payment of any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are not otherwise payable.    

 (d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.     ##### 

  

     

 1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The cash amounts paid and to be paid in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article 1_.   

 1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.6_ hereof; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to provide an indemnity or deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the Company Stock Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

 1.10 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action on the part of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest in the Surviving Corporation full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, or to effect the assignment to the Surviving Corporation of any and all Intellectual Property created by a founder, employee or consultant of the Company, or to complete and prosecute all domestic and foreign patent filings related to Company Intellectual Property, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

 (i) (A) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company or any Signatory Stockholder in this Agreement as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule (including any exhibit or schedule to the Company Disclosure Schedule) to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time as though such representation or warranty were made as of the Effective Time, except in the case of representations and warranties which by their terms speak only as of a specific date, in which event for any failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and correct as of such date, (B) any failure of any certification, representation or warranty made by the Company or any Signatory Stockholder in any certificate delivered to Parent or a Signatory Stockholder pursuant to any provision of this Agreement (other than the Capitalization Certificate and the Statement of Transaction Expenses) to be true and correct as of the date of such certificate, or (C) any failure of the Company and each Company Subsidiary to enforce a policy requiring each employee, consultant and independent contractor who has ever had access to the confidential information or trade secrets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any information that Company or any Company Subsidiary has an obligation to maintain as confidential) to execute a confidentiality agreement in customary form and substance;   

 (ii) any inaccuracy in the Capitalization Certificate;    ##### 

  

  

 (iii) any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Company or any Signatory Stockholder in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule (including any exhibit or schedule to the Company Disclosure Schedule);   

 (iv) any Transaction Expenses of the Company that are not reflected in the Statement of Transaction Expenses;   

 (v) any discrepancy between the Cash Adjustment Amount which served to adjust the Aggregate Merger Consideration at the Closing and the Cash Adjustment Amount determined by the Parent and its independent auditors prior to December 31, 2005 (for the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that the Stockholder Agent may object to any such determination made by the Parent under the procedures set forth in _Section 7.6_); and   

 (vi) any payments paid with respect to Dissenting Shares to the extent that such payments, in the aggregate, exceed the value of the amounts that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to  _Section 1.6(a)_ upon the exchange of such Dissenting Shares.

 (c) To the extent that one Effective Time Company Stockholder (the " _Paying Stockholder_ ") makes an indemnity payment hereunder which is greater than its pro rata portion of such payment (based on the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration received by such Effective Time Company Stockholder), each other Effective Time Company Stockholder shall make a payment to such Paying Stockholder so that each Effective Time Company Stockholder shall have paid its pro rata portion of such indemnity payment; _provided, however_ , that to the extent an indemnity payment made by a Paying Stockholder relates to a representation or warranty regarding capitalization or title to Company Capital Stock of such Effective Time Company Stockholder, the Paying Stockholder shall be entitled to reimbursement in full for such payment by the applicable Effective Time Company Stockholder whose shares of Company Capital Stock or the title thereto was the subject of the underlying indemnity claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the foregoing rights of contribution shall not be deemed to limit, restrict or otherwise impair the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any of them) to indemnification under this _Article 7_.    

 (d) In determining the amount of any Losses in respect of the failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any particular date (but not in determining whether any such representations and warranties failed to be true and correct as of any particular     ##### 

  

    

date), any materiality standard or qualification contained in such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is consummated, the amount of Losses that the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any of them) may recover pursuant to a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall be offset, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, against (i) any amounts actually received by the Parent      ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Parties making such claim in respect of the Losses forming the
basis of such claim for indemnification from a third party pursuant to any
indemnification or other similar right and (ii) any amounts actually received

any insurance policy or other similar arrangement, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), net of any and all applicable collection
costs and a reasonable valuation of any premium adjustments resulting
therefrom (the " _Third Party Recovery Limitation_ "); _provided, however_
, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Third Party Recovery Limitation (i)
shall not apply to claims for indemnification for Losses arising out of fraud
or willful misconduct, (ii) shall not apply to claims for indemnification
under _Sections 7.2(a)(ii) Â– 7.2(a)(vi)_, inclusive, and (iii) shall not be
interpreted or construed to require the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any

Parent Indemnified Parties shall elect not to seek or otherwise pursue any
such third party recoveries or insurance proceeds, the Third Party
Recovery Limitation shall not apply).    

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is consummated, the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 7_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for claims by the Parent Indemnified Parties arising out of the matters relating to this Agreement, any certificate or other document related hereto or delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing limitation on remedies shall not apply (i) to claims for indemnification for Losses arising out of fraud or willful misconduct, (ii) to claims for indemnification under _Sections 7.2(a)(ii) Â– 7.2(a)(vi)_, inclusive, or (iii) if the Merger is not consummated; _provided, however_ , that in the case of this clause (iii), the limitations set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ , _Section 7.1(d)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ shall apply to any claims or causes of action arising out of the matters described in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ irrespective of the nature of such claims or causes of action.    

 (f) If the Merger is consummated, the Escrow Fund shall be available to secure the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this _Article 7_.

 7.4 _Period for Indemnification Claims Against Escrow Fund_.   

 The period during which claims for indemnification for Losses may be made against the Escrow Fund shall commence at the Effective Time and terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at the conclusion of the Escrow Period, such portion of the Escrow Fund as in the reasonable judgment of Parent may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for indemnification for Losses specified in any OfficerÂ’s Certificate delivered in accordance with the terms hereof prior to expiration of the Escrow Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims have been finally and fully resolved or satisfied. The remainder, if any, of the Escrow Fund shall be paid to the Effective Time Company Stockholders promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the expiration of the Escrow Period and the Parent and the Stockholder Agent shall give the Escrow Agent written    ##### 

  

 

instructions to that effect. After the expiration of the Escrow Period, upon
resolution of a pending claim for Losses, the portion of the Escrow Fund
remaining, if any, after such Losses have been satisfied, shall be returned
to the Effective Time Company Stockholders promptly (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days) after the final resolution of the underlying
claim.    

 7.5 _Indemnification Claim Procedures During the Escrow Period_.   

 (a) On or before the expiration of the Escrow Period, Parent may deliver to the Escrow Agent, on behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Parties, a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an " _Officer Â’s Certificate_"):    

 (i) stating that a Parent Indemnified Party has paid, suffered, incurred or sustained (or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, suffer, incur or sustain) Losses for which such Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2_;   

 (ii) stating the amount of such Losses (which, in the case of Losses not yet paid, suffered, incurred, sustained, may be the maximum amount reasonably anticipated to be so paid, suffered, incurred or sustained);   

 (iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed by Parent) the individual items of such Losses included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim for indemnification to which such Losses relate; and   

 (iv) the specific provisions of this Agreement that form the basis for such claim for indemnification for such Losses.   

 (b) Subject to _Section 7.1_, no delay in providing an OfficerÂ’s Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof shall affect a Parent Indemnified PartyÂ’s rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Stockholder Agent or any other applicable Indemnifying Parties are materially prejudiced thereby.    

 (c) At the time of delivery of any OfficerÂ’s Certificate to the Escrow Agent, Parent shall deliver a duplicate copy of such OfficerÂ’s Certificate to the Stockholder Agent, and for a period of twenty (20) Business Days after such delivery to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Agent of such OfficerÂ’s Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no payment or other disbursement of Escrow Funds pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Stockholder Agent to make such delivery or disbursement. After the expiration of such 20-Business Day period, the Escrow Agent shall make deliver or disburse cash from the Escrow Fund having a value equal to such Losses from the Escrow Fund to Parent in accordance with this _Section 7.5_; _provided, however_ , that no such delivery may be made if and to the extent the Stockholder Agent shall object in a written statement to any claim or claims made in the OfficerÂ’s Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the expiration of such 20-Business Day period.    

 7.6 _Resolution of Objections to Indemnification Claims_.    ##### 

  

   

 (a) If the Stockholder Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by Parent made in any OfficerÂ’s Certificate within the 20-Business Day period referenced in _Section 7.5_, Parent and the Stockholder Agent shall attempt in good faith for twenty (20) Business Days after ParentÂ’s receipt of such written objection to resolve such objection. If Parent and the Stockholder Agent shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such memorandum.    

 (b) If no such agreement can be reached during such 20-Business Day period for good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 20-Business Day period, either Parent or the Stockholder Agent may bring suit in the courts of the State of California and the Federal courts of the United States of America, in each case, located within the counties of San Francisco, Santa Clara or San Mateo in the State of California to resolve the matter.    

 (c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.    

 7.7 _Stockholder Agent_.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Stockholder Agent" shall mean the agent for and on behalf of the Effective Time Company Stockholders to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf of itself of any other Indemnified Person) relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such shareholders individually); (ii) authorize deliveries to Parent of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2_ asserted by Parent Indemnified Parties; (iii) object to such claims pursuant to _Section 7.6_ ; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, such claims; (v) consent or agree to any amendment to this Agreement and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. The Person serving as the Stockholder Agent may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the cash then on deposit in the Escrow Fund upon not less than ten (10) daysÂ’ prior written notice to Parent. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Agent, and the Stockholder Agent shall receive no compensation for its services.    

 (b) The Stockholder Agent shall not be liable to any Effective Time Company Stockholder or any other former holder of Company Capital Stock for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholder Agent while acting in good faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Effective Time Company Stockholders shall      ##### 

  

    

severally indemnify the Stockholder Agent and hold it harmless from and
against any loss, liability or expense (plus 8% interest per annum) incurred
without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably incurred by the
Stockholder Agent. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Agent by the
Effective Time Company Stockholders, such losses, liabilities or expenses
(plus 8% interest per annum) may be recovered by the Stockholder Agent
from shares or other property in the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to
the Effective Time Company Stockholders (and not distributed or distributable
to an Indemnified Person or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an
Indemnified Person) following the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date
pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement, at the time of
distribution, and such recovery will be made from the Effective Time Company
Stockholders according to their respective pro rata shares of the Escrow
Fund.    

 (c) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholder Agent that is within the scope of the Stockholder AgentÂ’s authority under this  _Article 7_ shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Effective Time Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Effective Time Company Stockholder. Each Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such Effective Time Company Stockholder.    

 7.8 _Third Party Claims_.   

 (a) In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party claim which Parent believes may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2_ by or on behalf of a Parent Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Agent of such Third Party Claim if such claim occurs during the Escrow Period, or each of the Indemnifying Parties that Parent (or any other Parent Indemnified Parties) may bring a claim against if such Third Party Claim occurs after the Escrow Period. Subject to _Section 7.1_, no delay in notifying the Stockholder Agent or any other Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof shall affect a Parent Indemnified PartyÂ’s rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Stockholder Agent or any other applicable Indemnifying Parties are materially prejudiced thereby.    

 (b) Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to elect to conduct the defense of any Third Party Claim (and the costs and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with such defense (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, other professionalsÂ’ and expertsÂ’ fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the Losses for which the Parent Indemnified Parties may seek indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2)_. The Stockholder Agent (during the Escrow Period) and any other Indemnifying Party against whom any Parent Indemnified Party      ##### 

  

    

has brought a claim for indemnification arising out of such Third Party Claim
(after the Escrow Period) shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such Third Party Claim
to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege
relating to any Parent Indemnified Party, and each such Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, any defense of any such Third Party Claim with respect to any such
Third Party Claim.    

 (c) Neither Parent nor any other Parent Indemnified Party shall settle or otherwise compromise a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Agent (during the Escrow Period, with respect to funds held in the Escrow Fund) and/or each Indemnifying Party against whom any Parent Indemnified Party has brought or is entitled to bring a claim for indemnification arising out of such Third Party Claim (either during the Escrow Period, with respect to claims for indemnification beyond the funds then held in the Escrow Fund, or after the Escrow Period), in each case which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided, however_ , that in the event the Stockholder Agent or such Indemnified Party or Parties, as applicable, shall consent in writing to the settlement of any such Third Party Claim, neither the Stockholder Agent nor any such Indemnifying Party or Parties, as applicable, shall have any right, power or authority to object to the amount of any claim for indemnification under this _Article 7_ by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified Party for Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim and the defense and settlement thereof (except to the extent such claim is for an amount in excess of the amount of the settlement consented to). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party may settle or otherwise compromise any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Stockholder Agent or any Indemnifying Party, as applicable, if and to the extent that (i) the terms of such settlement or other compromise do not require the payment of money to any third party, or (ii) the terms of such settlement or other compromise require the payment of money to a third party in an aggregate amount that is at least two (2) times the aggregate amount for which the Indemnifying Parties may be liable pursuant to this _Article 7 _in respect of such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that in the event Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party shall settle or otherwise compromise any such Third Party Claim pursuant to this sentence without the consent of the Stockholder Agent or any Indemnifying Party, as applicable, the amount of such settlement shall not be determinative of the Indemnifying PartiesÂ’ indemnification obligations in respect thereof or the amount of Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim for which Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this _Article 7_. In the event that Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party shall settle or otherwise compromise any Third Party Claim in violation of the requirements of this _Section 7.8(c)_, neither Parent nor any other Parent Indemnified Party shall (i) be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_ or (ii) otherwise be entitled to bring a claim against the Stockholder Agent and/or the applicable Indemnifying Parties, in either case, in respect of any Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim. Prior to settling or otherwise compromising any Third Party Claim, Parent or other Parent Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall consult in good faith with the Stockholder Agent and/or the applicable Indemnifying Parties regarding such settlement.

 (a) Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, for all purposes of and under this Agreement:    

 (i) words of any gender include each other gender and the neuter;    ##### 

  

  

 (ii) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively;   

 (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision hereof;   

 (iv) the terms "Article" or "Section" or other subdivision refer to the specified Article, Section or other subdivision of the body of this Agreement;   

 (v) the term Exhibits refers to Exhibits to this Agreement;   

 (vi) the phrases "ordinary course of business" and "ordinary course of business consistent with past practice" refer to the business and practice of the Company;   

 (vii) the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation;"   

 (viii) the phrase "materiality limitation," with respect to a partyÂ’s representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, includes all qualifications, limitations, thresholds and exceptions based on the concept of materiality, whether or not expressed by the word "material", "materially", "materiality", "material adverse change", "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or "Company Material Adverse Effect;"   

 (ix) when a statement herein with respect to a particular matter is qualified by the phrase "in all material respects," materiality shall be determined solely by reference to, and solely within the context of, the specified matter and not with respect to the entirety of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;   

 (x) the phrase "fraud or willful misconduct" includes any willful or intentional breach or violation of, or any willful or intentional misrepresentation or inaccuracy in (including pursuant to omissions from the Company Disclosure Schedules made with the knowledge and intent that such omissions would cause the applicable representations and warranties to be inaccurate), any representation or warranty of the Company or any Signatory Stockholder contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered to Parent or a Signatory Stockholder pursuant to any provision of this Agreement;   

 (xi) all accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP; and   

 (xii) the terms "party" or "parties" refer to Parent, on the one hand, and the Company and the Stockholders, on the other hand, and the terms "third party" or "third parties" refers to Persons other than Parent, the Company and the Stockholders.   

 (b) The drafting and negotiation of the representations, warranties, covenants and conditions to the obligations of the Company and Parent herein reflect compromises and certain provisions may overlap with other provisions or may address the same or similar subject matters in different ways or for different purposes. It is the intention of the parties that, to the     ##### 

  

    

extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot
be given to both or all such provisions, (i) the representations, warranties,
covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement shall be construed to be
cumulative; (ii) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition
in this Agreement shall be given full separate and independent effect; and
(iii) no limitation in any representation, warranty, covenant or closing
condition shall be construed to limit any other representation, warranty,
covenant or closing condition unless such limitation is expressly
made applicable to such other representation, warranty, covenant or closing
condition. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the fact that a
matter is disclosed in a representation or warranty (or the related section
of the applicable Disclosure Schedule) or is permitted (or not prohibited) by
one covenant, shall not be construed as an express or implied exception to any
other representation and warranty or covenant concerning the same subject
matter or as an exception to the related "bringdown" condition in the
partiesÂ’ closing conditions and no inference shall be drawn from the first
representation and warranty or covenant as to the scope or meaning of
any other representation and warranty, covenant or closing condition.    

 (c) No amendment, supplement or update after the date of this Agreement shall be made to the Company Disclosure Schedule without the express written consent of Parent and no amendment, supplement or update made or delivered (or purporting to be made or delivered) after the date of this Agreement without such consent shall have any effect on any of the rights or obligations of the Company or Parent, respectively.
