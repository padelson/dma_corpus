iii      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,
dated as of October 29, 2000 (the "AGREEMENT"), among PRIMEDIA Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Abracadabra Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("SUB"),
and About.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY").   WHEREAS, the
Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub and the Company have declared this
Agreement to be advisable, and the Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the
Company have each approved the merger of Sub with and into the Company and
the Company becoming a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent (the
"MERGER") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware ("DGCL") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;   WHEREAS, certain stockholders of Parent holding not less than 70%
of the outstanding voting securities of Parent have entered into a
voting agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "PARENT VOTING
AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to
consent to the issuance of Parent Common Stock (as defined below) in the
Merger;   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as an inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub to
enter into this Agreement, certain holders of shares of common stock, par
value $.001 per share (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), of the Company have each
entered into a voting agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the
"SHAREHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which such holders have agreed
to vote their shares of Company Common Stock in the manner set forth therein;
and   WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE");   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER   SECTION 1.1. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
of the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"). At Parent\'s election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that any direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation
in the Merger. In the event of such an election, the parties agree to execute
an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
election.      SECTION 1.2. EFFECTIVE TIME. As soon as practicable after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware (or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger
and agreed upon by the parties hereto) being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").  
SECTION 1.3. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.4.
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BY-LAWS. (a) At the Effective Time and without
any further action on the part of the Company and Sub, the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION") as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter and further amended as provided therein and under the
DGCL.   (b) At the Effective Time and without any further action on the
part of the Company and Sub, the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the
Company (the "BY-LAWS") shall be the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation and thereafter may be amended or repealed in accordance
with their terms or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and as provided by law.   SECTION 1.5. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.
The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed (as
the case may be) and qualified.   SECTION 1.6. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:   (a) Subject to Section 1.8, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section
1.6(b) hereof) shall be converted into 2.3409 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"PARENT COMMON STOCK"), of Parent (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of   
2    fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 1.9, without interest.   (b) Each share of Company Common Stock
that is (i) held in the treasury of the Company or (ii) owned by Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.   (c) Each share of common stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation and shall thereafter constitute all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.7.
TREATMENT OF EMPLOYEE OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate,
any Committee thereof) and the Board of Directors of Parent (or, if
appropriate, any Committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary to provide that as of the Effective Time all
outstanding stock options of the Company (the "COMPANY STOCK RIGHTS")
heretofore granted under any stock option plan of the Company or its acquired
subsidiaries (the "STOCK PLANS") and which are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and be deemed to constitute
an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock or, in the case of
Company Stock Rights which are in the form of restricted stock, shares
of restricted Parent Common Stock (collectively, "NEW STOCK RIGHTS") in an
amount and, if applicable, at an exercise price determined as provided
below:   (i) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be  subject to
the New Stock Rights shall be equal to the product  of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock remaining  subject (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) to the  original Company Stock Right and the Exchange Ratio,
PROVIDED  that any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting  from
such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest  share; and   (ii)
The exercise price per share of Parent Common  Stock under the New Stock
Right shall be equal to the exercise  price per share of the Company Common
Stock under the original  Company Stock Right divided by the Exchange Ratio,
PROVIDED  that such exercise price shall be rounded down to the nearest 
cent.   The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which
are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall
be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent
with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as may be required by the terms of
the Automatic Option Grant Program under the 1998 Stock Option/Stock Issuance
Plan or any grants thereunder as of the date hereof to directors, the Company
shall not accelerate the vesting, or otherwise amend the terms, of any
unvested Company Stock Rights under any of the Stock Plans. After the
Effective Time, each New Stock Right shall be exercisable and shall vest upon
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related Company Stock
Right      3    immediately prior to the Effective Time except that
all references to the Company shall be deemed to be references to the
Parent.   (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to
the terms of the Company\'s 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"),
each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP shall be exercised for the
purchase of Company Common Stock at the price per share set forth in the
ESPP. The Company Common Stock purchased under the ESPP shall be considered
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be
converted pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof. In addition, prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall amend the ESPP to provide for (i) its continuation
from and after the Effective Time and (ii) a new offering period to commence
from and after the Effective Time and to terminate immediately prior to the
start of the next succeeding offering period under the PRIMEDIA Employee
Stock Purchase Plan for which participants in the ESPP are eligible to
particpate.   (c) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective
Time no holder of a Company Stock Right or any participant in any Stock Plans
shall have any right thereunder to acquire capital stock of the Company, Sub,
or the Surviving Corporation. The Company will take all reasonable steps to
ensure that, immediately following the Effective Time, none of Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries is
or will be bound by any Company Stock Rights, other options, warrants, rights
or agreements which would entitle any person, other than Sub or its
affiliates, to own any capital stock of the Company, Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries or to receive any payment
in respect thereof.   (d) In connection with the issuance of New Stock
Rights and the assumption of the ESPP, Parent shall (i) reserve for issuance
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will become
subject to New Stock Rights and the ESPP pursuant to this Section 1.7 from
and after the Effective Time, upon exercise of New Stock Rights and the
purchase rights under the ESPP, (ii) make available for issuance all shares
of Parent Common Stock covered thereby, subject to the terms and conditions
applicable thereto, and (iii) if necessary, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, file a registration statement on Form S-8
covering the shares to be issued upon exercise of the New Stock Rights and
the purchase rights under the ESPP.   SECTION 1.8. FRACTIONAL INTERESTS. No
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and such fractional interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.
In lieu of any such fractional interests, each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6(a) who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of record by
such holder) shall receive cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied
by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE as
reported by The Wall Street Journal (or if not reported thereby, any other
authoritative source) on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.12),
rounded down to the nearest cent.     4    SECTION 1.9. SURRENDER OF
SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK; STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. (a) Prior to the
Closing Date, Sub shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger
(the "EXCHANGE AGENT") to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock (and any
cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) to
which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled
pursuant to Sections 1.6(a) and 1.8. When and as needed, Parent or Sub will
make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash to make all exchanges pursuant to Section 1.9(b).   (b) Promptly
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed
to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES"), a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock therefor and for cash payable in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.6(a) and (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.8, after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If the exchange of certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such exchange shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the exchange of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.   (c) At any time
following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares
of Parent Common Stock (and any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock) which had been made available to the Exchange Agent
and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock (and any
cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any holder of a Certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock (and any
cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.     5    (d) At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law.   (e) No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common
Stock it is entitled to receive and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
interests shall be paid pursuant to Section 1.8 until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to
the person in whose name the certificates representing such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued, any dividends or distributions with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock which have a record date after
the Effective Time and shall have become payable between the Effective Time
and the time of such surrender. In no event shall the person entitled to
receive such dividends or distributions be entitled to receive interest
thereon.   (f) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either Sub or the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of each of Sub and the Company or otherwise, all such deeds,
bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in such names
and on such behalves or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may
be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.   SECTION 1.10. LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such holder of
a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   SECTION 1.11. WITHHOLDING
RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code     6    and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   SECTION 1.12.
CLOSING AND CLOSING DATE. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
and the transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant
to the provisions of Section 7.1, the closing (the "CLOSING") of this
Agreement shall take place (a) at 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the second
business day after all of the conditions to the respective obligations of the
parties set forth in Article VI hereof shall have been satisfied or waived or
(b) at such other time and date as Parent and the Company shall agree (such
date and time on and at which the Closing occurs being referred to herein as
the "CLOSING DATE"). The Closing shall take place at such location as Parent
and the Company shall agree.   ARTICLE II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY   The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Sub that, except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of
the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Sub prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") or in
any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule if it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure applies:   SECTION 2.1.
ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. Each of the Company and each of its
subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the
requisite corporate power and authority and any necessary governmental
approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
power, authority and governmental approvals could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). Each of the Company and each of its subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
duly qualified or licensed or in good standing which could not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. When used in this Article II or otherwise in connection with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means
any change or effect that would be materially adverse to the business,
properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or that would
materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
hereunder; PROVIDED that none of the following shall be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or could be a Material Adverse Effect: (w)
any employee attrition after the date hereof; (x) any change arising from the
public announcement of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (y) any change in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common    7      Stock after the date hereof; or (z) any
adverse effect on the Company attributable solely to conditions affecting the
business to consumer Internet industry, the United States economy as a whole
or foreign economies in any locations where the Company or any of its
subsidiaries has material operations or sales (and not having a materially
disproportionate effect on the Company).   SECTION 2.2. CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS. The Company has heretofore furnished or made
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-Laws as currently in effect. Such Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws are in full force and effect and no other
organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company.  
SECTION 2.3. CAPITALIZATION; SUBSIDIARIES. (a) The authorized capital stock
of the Company consists of 105,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ("PREFERRED STOCK"),
and (ii) 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock. As of September 30,
2000, (i) 18,462,290 shares of Company Common Stock were issued
and outstanding, all of which shares were duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of preemptive (or similar)

VI not being satisfied.   SECTION 4.2. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF PARENT PENDING
THE MERGER. (a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the

of the conditions set  forth in Article VI not being satisfied;   (iv)
Issue, deliver, sell, pledge, dispose of or  encumber, or authorize or commit

to any record or  beneficial owner of five percent or more of the voting 
securities of Parent, except on an arms-length basis; or   (v) Adopt a plan
of complete or partial liquidation or  dissolution of Parent (other than the
Merger).   (b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of

any action taken or agreed to be taken by the Company or any of its
affiliates) would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.

S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its respective
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities law in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company
and the holders of the Company Common Stock and rights to acquire Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Plans as may be reasonably required in
connection with any such action. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning itself to the other as may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and the preparation, filing and distribution of
the Proxy Statement. The Company, Parent and Sub each agree to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement
that shall have become false or misleading.   (b) The Company, acting
through its Board of Directors, shall, subject to and in accordance with its
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, promptly and duly call,
give       30    notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable
following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective a meeting of the
holders of Company Common Stock for the purpose of voting to approve and
adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (i)
recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, by the stockholders of the Company and include in the
Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) take all reasonable and lawful
action to solicit and obtain such approval. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall not withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its
recommendation referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence (or
announce publicly its intention to do so), except that such Board of
Directors shall be permitted to withdraw, amend or modify its
recommendation (or publicly announce its intention to do so) if: (i) the
Company has complied with Section 5.4; (ii) an unsolicited Superior Proposal
(as defined in Section 5.4) shall have been proposed by any person other than
Parent and such proposal is pending at the time of such withdrawal, amendment
or modification and (iii) the Company shall have notified Parent of such
Superior Proposal at least three business days in advance of such withdrawal,
amendment or modification; PROVIDED that, in the event that, during the
period prior to such withdrawal, amendment or modification, Parent offers to
enter into a transaction with the Company on substantially the same or more
favorable financial terms to the Company as such Superior Proposal, as
determined in good faith by a financial advisor to the Company of nationally
recognized standing, the Company shall not be permitted to withdraw, amend or
modify its recommendation (or publicly announce its intention to do so) or
accept such Superior Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) the Company agrees that its obligation to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common
Stock, as required by this Section 5.1, shall not be affected by the
withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Board of Directors\'
recommendation of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) subject to the Company\'s rights
pursuant to Section 5.4, the Company agrees that its obligations under this
Section 5.1(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,

to make stock transfer records relating to the Company available to the
extent reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of this Agreement.

accordance with its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, duly as soon as
possible, set a record date for the determination of stockholders of Parent
entitled to vote by written consent to approve the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger. Parents shall take all other actions necessary or
advisable to cause the execution of such consent as soon as possible
thereafter.   (e) Parent, acting through its Board of Directors, shall,
in accordance with its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, send the
Proxy Statement to its other stockholders pursuant to Rule 14C of the
Exchange Act.   SECTION 5.2. ACCOUNTANTS\' LETTERS. (a) The Company shall

"comfort" letter of each of Ernst and Young LLP, the Company\'s independent
public accountants, and KPMG LLP, the Company\'s previous independent
public accountants, dated a date within two business days before the date on
which      31    the Form S-4 shall become effective and addressed to
Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary
in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Form
S-4. In connection with the Company\'s efforts to obtain such letter, if
requested by Ernst and Young LLP and/or KPMG LLP, Parent shall provide a
representation letter to Ernst and Young LLP and/or KPMG LLP, complying with
the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72 ("SAS 72"), if then required.  
(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
the Company a "comfort" letter of Deloitte and Touche LLP, Parent\'s
independent public accountants, dated a date within two business days before
the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective and addressed to the
Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company

representation letter to Deloitte and Touche LLP complying with SAS 72, if then
required.   SECTION 5.3. ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. (a)
From the date hereof to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees,
auditors and other agents to, afford the officers, employees, auditors and
other agents of Parent or the Company, respectively, who shall agree to be
bound by the provisions of this Section 5.3 as though a party hereto,
complete access at all reasonable times to its officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities and to all books and
records, and shall furnish Parent or the Company, respectively, with all
financial, operating and other data and information as Parent or the Company,
respectively, through its officers, employees or agents may from time to time
request. In addition, subsequent to the date of this Agreement, Parent and/or
any of its subsidiaries may initiate communications with any officer or key
employee of the Company for the purpose of addressing the prospective
retention of such officer or employee following the Closing, PROVIDED that
Parent believes, in good faith, that there is a compelling, legitimate
business need to initiate such communication prior to the Closing Date.  
(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold and will cause its directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors (including, without limitation, counsel
and auditors) and controlling persons to hold any such information which is
nonpublic in confidence on the same terms and conditions as the
confidentiality provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
dated July 27, 2000, as amended from time to time, between the Company and
Parent (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").   (c) No investigation pursuant
to this Section 5.3 shall affect any representations or warranties of the
parties herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto.   SECTION 5.4. NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS. The Company agrees
that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of the officers
and directors of it or its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and
cause its and its subsidiaries\' employees, agents and   
32    representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate
(including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer with respect to (i) a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving it or any of its subsidiaries,
or (ii) any purchase or sale of all or any significant portion of the assets
or 15% or more of the equity securities of it or any of its subsidiaries (any
such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL"), and agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
direct and cause its and its subsidiaries\' employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly,
have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or data to
any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal or accept an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company or its Board
of Directors shall be permitted to (A) to the extent applicable, comply with
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal, or (B) engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any information to, any person in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such person, if and only to the
extent that, in the case of the actions referred to in clause (B), (i) the
Company\'s stockholders meeting relating to the adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company shall not have occurred, (ii) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and was not solicited by
it and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.4, (iii) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, based on the
advice of its outside legal advisors, that in light of this Superior
Proposal, if the Company fails to participate in such discussions or
negotiations with, or provide such information to, the person making such
Superior Proposal, it would be in violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, (iv) prior to providing any information or data to any person
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, the Board of
Directors of the Company receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (v) prior to providing
any information or data to any person or entering into discussions
or negotiations with any person, the Board of Directors of the Company
notifies Parent promptly of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by,
any such information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers. The Company agrees
that it will keep Parent informed reasonably promptly of any material change
in the terms of any such proposals or offers and will notify Parent 24 hours
in advance before an agreement is reached. The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or similar transaction or arrangement.
The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform
the individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence of this Section
5.4 of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4. Nothing in this
Section 5.4 shall (x) permit the Company to terminate this Agreement (except
as specifically provided in Article VII hereof) or (y) affect any other
obligation of the Company under this Agreement. For purposes of this Section
5.4, "SUPERIOR     33   PROPOSAL" shall mean a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in
good faith, upon the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation), (i) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is
more favorable to all of the Company\'s stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of
being completed (PROVIDED that for purposes of this definition of "Superior
Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in this Section 5.4, except that the reference to "15%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to
"51%" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a
transaction involving the Company, and the reference to "assets" (including
the shares of any subsidiary of the Company) shall refer to the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not the assets of any of
the subsidiaries alone).   SECTION 5.5. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS. (a) The
Company shall or Parent shall cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation
to promptly pay or provide when due all compensation and benefits earned
through or prior to the Effective Time as provided pursuant to the terms of
any Plans in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on Section 2.10 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent and the Company agree that the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall pay promptly or provide when due
all compensation and benefits required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
any individual agreement with any employee, former employee, director or
former director in effect and disclosed to Parent as of the date hereof.
Nothing herein shall require the continued employment of any person or
prevent the Company and/or the Surviving Corporation from taking any action
or refraining from taking any action that the Company could take or refrain
from taking prior to the Effective Time.   (b) Parent shall, for the period
ending on December 31, 2001, maintain (or cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain) employee benefit plans (other than with respect to equity-based
compensation, except as contemplated by Section 1.7(b)) for the benefit of
each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who continues employment
with the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the Plans in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time with respect to each such employee; provided, that nothing
herein shall require Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation to continue to
maintain any Plan or grant any such employee any equity-based compensation in
the Surviving Corporation or Parent. For purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, eligibility for benefit forms and subsidies and the vesting
of benefits under such plans (without duplication of benefits as a result
thereof), the Surviving Corporation shall give effect to years of service
with the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of years of service for
which credit was given by the Company and its subsidiaries. No employee
electing coverage under the medical insurance plans of the Surviving
Corporation shall be excluded from coverage thereunder (for such employee and
any person covered by virtue of such employee\'s employment) on the basis of
a pre-existing condition that was not also excluded under the
Company\'s medical insurance plan.   SECTION 5.6. DIRECTORS\' AND
OFFICERS\' INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE. (a) The By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to   
34   indemnification and exculpation from liability than are set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors, officers
or employees of the Company.   (b) For six years from the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, unless Parent agrees in writing to guarantee
the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 5.6(a), maintain in
effect the current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering
those persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy to the extent that it provides coverage
for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (a copy of which has been
heretofore delivered to Parent), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not be in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of
this Agreement (the "COMPANY\'S CURRENT PREMIUM"). If such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 150% of the Company\'s Current Premium,
then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of
insurance that in the Surviving Corporation\'s good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 150% of
the Company\'s Current Premium.   SECTION 5.7. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN
MATTERS. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could be likely to cause
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any failure of the Company,
Parent or Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   SECTION 5.8.
FURTHER ACTION; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof,
including but not limited to (i) cooperation in the preparation and filing of
the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement, and required filings under the HSR Act and
any amendments to any thereof and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to
make all required regulatory filings and applications and to obtain
all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications
and orders of governmental authorities and parties to contracts with the
Company and its subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to
the Merger. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make, to the extent it has not already done so, an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within five business days of the date hereof and
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. In case
at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the     
35    proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall
use their reasonable best efforts to take all such necessary action. In the
event that a suit or objection is instituted by any person or governmental
authority challenging this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
as violative of applicable competition and antitrust laws, each of Parent and
the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to resist or resolve such
suit or objection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any such
objection or suit instituted by such person or governmental authority
(including, but not limited to, the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice), neither Parent nor Sub shall be
required to provide any undertakings or agree to any condition that could
reasonably be expected to result in a substantial detriment to Parent\'s or
the Company\'s business or results of operations (a "SUBSTANTIAL
DETRIMENT").   SECTION 5.9. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Merger and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be required by law or any listing agreement
with its securities exchange.   SECTION 5.10. STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have approved for listing on
the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance,
the Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger.   SECTION
5.11. AFFILIATES. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a letter identifying all persons who are, at the time this Agreement
is submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of
the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such person to deliver to
Parent on or prior to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in
the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.   SECTION 5.12. BOARD OF DIRECTORS
AND OFFICERS OF PARENT. Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to appoint
the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer to the Board of Directors of Parent,
effective immediately following the Effective Time. The Board of Directors of
Parent also shall appoint the Company\'s Chief Executive Officer as Chief
Internet Officer of Parent, effective immediately following the Effective
Time.   SECTION 5.13. SECTION 16B APPROVALS. The Board of Directors
or Compensation Committee of Parent shall grant all approvals and take all
other actions required pursuant to Rules 16b-3(d) and 16b-3(e) under the
Exchange Act to cause the Parent Common Stock and New Stock Rights to be
exempt from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.   SECTION
5.14. SEC DOCUMENTS. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall furnish to the Company and Parent, respectively,
a complete and correct copy of any agreements, documents or other
instruments, or amendment or modifications thereto, which are filed by Parent
or the Company, respectively, with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.    36     SECTION
5.15. CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. The Company shall take no action to terminate the
employment of Messrs. Kurnit and Day in their current jobs and shall not
diminish their respective responsibilities or compensation, except that the
