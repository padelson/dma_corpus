 ** _6.2_** ** _ _****__Right of Entry.__** Buyer agrees that the
provisions of this Section shall apply to any and all access to the

right(s)-of-way or Permit, including, without limitation, all costs incurred

the benefit of Buyer, (B) provide gathering services in the pipelines located
on such Easements for buyer to the same extent that would have been available

with the HSR Act, but in no event will the Closing Date be extended past
August 30, 2004, unless further extension is mutually agreed upon by the

 **ARTICLE VIII**

  



  

 ** _POST-CLOSING RESPONSIBILITIES_**

  



  

 ** _8.1_** ** _ _****__Consents.__** Certain of the Contracts provide, by
their terms, that the assignment thereof by Sellers requires the consent of
other parties to the Contracts. Sellers shall be obligated to obtain such
consents which shall be furnished to Buyer upon their receipt, which may be
after Closing.  Receipt of such consents shall not be a condition to Buyers
obligation to perform its obligations at Closing, but Sellers shall provide
such consents within 180 days after Closing. Sellers shall facilitate the
continuity and performance of any of the Contracts for which consents have
not been procured prior to Closing until such consents are obtained. In
performance of such obligation, Sellers shall assure that Buyer receives the
benefits of such Contracts which Buyer would have received if the consent had
been obtained, including any natural gas sold thereunder, and Buyer shall
fully perform Sellers obligations under such Contracts. In the event Sellers
receive funds attributable to periods after the Effective Time to which Buyer
would be entitled as a result of such consents not being procured (or
otherwise), Sellers shall immediately transmit or pay the same to Buyer.
Sellers shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless
from any and all claims and Liabilities asserted by any counterparty to a
Contract relating to the Closing of the transactions hereunder without such
consents.

  



  

 ** _8.2_** ** _ _****__Permits.__** It shall be Buyers responsibility to
obtain the issuance or transfer of all Federal, state or municipal
licenses, registrations and other operational permits and authority; provided
however, that Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers reasonable
efforts to obtain the transfer of such permits.

  



  

 ** _8.3_** ** _ _****__Sales and Other Taxes.__** As may be required by
relevant taxing agencies, Sellers shall collect and Buyer shall pay on the
date of Closing all applicable state and local sales tax, use tax,
gross receipts tax, business license tax and other taxes arising as a result
of the transactions hereunder, except taxes imposed by reason of income
to Sellers. Any state or local tax specified above, inclusive of any penalty
and interest, assessed at a future date against Sellers with respect to the
transaction covered herein shall be paid by Buyer or, if paid by Sellers,
Buyer shall promptly reimburse Sellers therefor. Any filing fees, recording
fees or other charges of governmental agencies or departments to file or
record the deeds, assignments and other documents delivered at Closing, which
may be due, shall be paid by Buyer.

  



  

 ** _8.4_** ** _ _****__Transfer of System By Buyer.__** In the event Buyer
sells, assigns or transfers all or a substantial part of the System, Buyer
shall cause its transferee to assume with Buyer Buyers liability for any
obligations of Buyer to Sellers under this Agreement. Such assumption shall
not affect Buyers continuing responsibility for such obligations.

  



  

29      
   



  

 **ARTICLE IX**

  



  

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

  



  

 ** _9.1_** ** _ _****__Post-Closing Operation by Sellers.__** Buyer
may hire the field employees of Sellers engaged in the operation of the
System after the Closing, and Sellers consent thereto.

  



  

 ** _9.2_** ** _ _****__Default.__** If Buyer defaults on or prior to Closing
in a material way on Buyers obligations, including but not limited to
Buyers absence at the designated time and place for Closing, Sellers shall
be entitled, as their sole and exclusive remedy, to be paid and retain the
Earnest Money Deposit as liquidated damages.  Further, Sellers shall be free
immediately to sell the Properties to any third party without any restriction
under or by reason of this Agreement. If Sellers default on or prior to
Closing in a material way on Sellers obligations, including but not limited
to Sellers absence at the designated time and place for Closing, Buyer may
specifically enforce Sellers obligation to close or, at its option, may
terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Earnest Money Deposit,
in addition to all of its other rights or remedies at law or in equity. In
the event that Closing fails to occur due to a failure of Section
7.3(b)(iii), or due to the failure to receive HSR approval after Buyers
performance of its obligations under Section 7.2 hereof, Buyer shall be
entitled to a refund of the Earnest Money Deposit.

  



  

 ** _9.3_** ** _ _****__Notices.__** All notices, requests, demands,
instructions and other communications required or permitted to be given

 ** _9.11_** ** _ _****__Severability.__** If any term or provision or
portions thereof is deemed invalid or unenforceable pursuant to a final

 ** _ADDENDUM TO_**

  

 ** _ _ASSET PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT__**

  



  

AMERICAN CENTRAL EASTERN TEXAS GAS COMPANY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ("Seller") and
MARKWEST ENERGY EAST TEXAS GAS COMPANY L.P. ("Buyer") are parties to that
certain Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement dated July 1, 2004, relating to the
Panola Gas System in Panola County, Texas (the "Purchase Agreement"). The
parties wish to modify the terms of the Purchase Agreement as provided
herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

  



  

1. Section 2.8 of the Purchase Agreement provides that Seller will assign and Buyer will assume certain obligations under the NGPL Contracts as defined by the Purchase Agreement.  Buyer has determined to enter into a new agreement with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America ("NGPL") to replace the Operational Gas Balancing Agreement and, therefore, the existing Operational Gas Balancing Agreement between NGPL and Seller will not be assigned to Buyer at Closing under the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

2. Section 3.2(a),  _Operating Revenues and Expenses_ , of the Purchase Agreement shall be replaced in its entirety by the following:

  



  

"a. All revenues attributable to the operation of the Properties prior to the
Effective Time shall be owned by and for the account of Seller. Seller shall
be entitled to all operating revenues and shall be responsible for all
operating expenses and related accounts payable arising in the ordinary
course of business attributable to the Properties, in each case to the extent
they relate to the time prior to the Effective Time.  Buyer shall be
entitled to all operating revenues and shall be responsible for the payment
of all operating expenses and related accounts payable arising in the
ordinary course of business attributable to the Properties, in each case to
the extent they relate to time after the Effective Time. The actual amounts
or values associated with the above shall be accounted for to the extent
known in the Preliminary Settlement Statement with the final reconciliation
contained in the Final Accounting Settlement. Buyer shall not be obligated
to pay or reimburse Seller for the services to be provided under the
Transition Services Agreement to be executed by the parties at Closing,
except as provided by that agreement."

  



  

3. Buyers lender has requested that the Deed of Trust instruments described in Section 4.1(i) of the Purchase Agreement not be released at Closing. The Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Deed of Trust instruments described in 4.1(i) of the Purchase Agreement shall not be released at Closing, but that Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Wachovia Bank, National Association, as

  



  

36      
   



  

Administrative Agent, all amounts due at Closing under such Deed of Trust
instruments.

  



  

This Addendum to Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement is executed the 
day of July, 2004.
