-iii-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 23, 2011 (the " _Agreement_
"), by and among ROCK-TENN COMPANY, a Georgia corporation (" _Parent_ "), SAM
ACQUISITION, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and SMURFIT-STONE CONTAINER
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms
used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in
_Section 9.12_; and

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent and the Company, and the
sole member of Merger Sub, have each declared that it is advisable and in the
best interests of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and the stockholders of
Parent and the Company and the sole member of Merger Sub, respectively, to
consummate, and each have approved, this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub (the "
_Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions
to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and
the DLLCA, at the Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into Merger
Sub. Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving entity (the "
_Surviving Entity_ "), and the separate limited liability company existence
of Merger Sub, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub may at any time, and to the
extent necessary to facilitate consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub will, change the method of effecting the
combination (including by providing for the merger of the Company directly
into Parent, with Parent surviving the Merger), and the Company shall
cooperate in such efforts, including by entering into an appropriate amendment
to this Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of
effecting the business combination and does not substantively affect this
Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, hereunder); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind
of the Merger Consideration (as defined in _Section 1.6(a)_) provided for in
this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of Company
Stockholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or the
Tax treatment of either  party pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
New York, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto,
at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than three (3) Business Days after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that
relate to action to be taken at the Closing, subject to the satisfaction of
such conditions (or, to the extent legally permitted, waiver by the party
or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions) at the Closing),
unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or
unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. As soon as practicable
after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
, the Merger shall become effective upon the filing, or such later time as
specified therein, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of a
certificate of merger or other appropriate document (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), and the parties shall make all other filings or recordings
required by the DGCL and the DLLCA. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the
date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the
Certificate of Merger. " _Effective Date_ " shall mean the date on which the
Effective Time occurs.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the
appropriate provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall possess all the properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises, and be subject to all of the restrictions, disabilities and
duties, of the Company and Merger Sub, as provided under Section 209 of the
DLLCA.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Formation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable Law (the " _Surviving Entity
Certificate_ "). The Limited Liability Company Agreement of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law (the " _Surviving Entity LLC Agreement_ "). 

1.5 _Officers of the Surviving Entity_. From and after the Effective
Time, the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Entity, until their successors shall have been duly elected,
appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Surviving Entity Certificate and the Surviving Entity
LLC Agreement.

 

1.6 _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_ and _Section 1.12_, each share of the
common stock, with par value $0.001, of the Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by 

 



2  Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (in each case, other than in a fiduciary
capacity) and except for Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 1.11_),
shall be converted into the right to receive (i) $17.50 in cash (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.30605 of a validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") of Class A common stock, par
value $0.01, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "). The Cash Consideration
and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to collectively herein as
the " _Merger Consideration_."

 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and, subject to _Section 1.11_, each
certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares
into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ and _Section 2.2(e)_, as
well as any dividends or distributions to which holders of Company Common
Stock are entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_. If, prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration.

(c) At the Effective Time, (1) all shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (in each case, other than in a
fiduciary capacity) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor and (2) each share of Company Common Stock held
by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger
Sub) or the Company, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) The sole limited liability company interest of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as the sole limited liability company interest of the Surviving
Entity.

1.7 _Certain Claims_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that has
been reserved in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization and Confirmation
Order (the " _Reserved Company Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into the
Merger Consideration.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent (i) shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, into the Companys disbursement account established with the
Companys Disbursing Agent (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization), (A)
immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration in
respect of the Reserved Company Common Stock converted in accordance with
_Section 1.7(a)_ and (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_ in respect of the Reserved Company Common Stock converted in
accordance with  _Section 1.7(a)_ and (ii) shall have taken all corporate
actions necessary to reserve, and shall have reserved, for

 



3  issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to deliver the
aggregate Stock Consideration in respect of the Reserved Company Common Stock
converted in accordance with  _Section 1.7(a)_. The Cash Consideration and
the Stock Consideration referred to the preceding sentence, together with any
dividends or distributions thereon and cash in lieu of fractional shares,
shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan of
Reorganization. No Reserved Company Common Stock shall be issued after the
Effective Time and each share of Reserved Company Common Stock shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time.

1.8 _Parent Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share
of Parent capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 

1.9 _Company Equity and Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_.

 

(i) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company Stock Option_
"), pursuant to the Companys equity-based compensation plans (the " _Company
Stock Plans_ ") and the award agreements evidencing the grants thereunder,
granted prior to the date of this Agreement to any current or former employee
or director of, consultant or other service provider to, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall immediately vest and become exercisable in accordance
with the terms of the Company Stock Plans, shall be assumed by Parent and
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (an " _Assumed Stock Option_ ") equal to (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share); and the per
share exercise price for Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to (i) the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), provided, however, that
such conversion and assumption of the Assumed Stock Options shall comply with
the regulations and other binding guidance under Section 409A of the Code.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed Stock Options shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including expiration date and
exercise provisions after taking into account the accelerated vesting of the
Company Stock Options as of the Effective Time as contemplated by the Company
Stock Plans) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Stock
Options immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company
Stock Option, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements
evidencing the grants thereunder, granted on or after the date of this
Agreement to any current or former employee or director of, consultant or
other service provider to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
assumed by Parent and shall, by virtue of the

 



4  Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into an Assumed Stock Option to purchase a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share); and the per share exercise price for Parent Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Assumed Stock Option shall be equal
to (i) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent), provided, however, that such conversion and assumption of
the Assumed Stock Options shall comply with the regulations and other binding
guidance under Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the Assumed Stock Options shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were
applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Options immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Company RSU Awards_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, the restrictions and vesting conditions
applicable to each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that was granted prior to
the date of this Agreement shall lapse at the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plans and each such Company
RSU Award shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying such
Company RSU Award, the combination of (i) $17.50 in cash and (ii) 0.30605 of a
share of Parent Common Stock (clauses (i) and (ii) together, the " _Per Share
Consideration_ ," and the aggregate amount of Per Share Consideration in
respect of all shares of Company Common Stock underlying a Company RSU Award,
the " _Award Consideration_ "). The Award Consideration, less applicable Tax
withholdings, shall be paid or provided by Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than five
business days following the Closing Date. Applicable Tax withholdings with
respect to the Award Consideration first shall reduce the cash portion of the
Award Consideration. Any Tax withholdings pursuant to this _Section
1.9(b)(i)_ that reduce the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable pursuant to this _Section 1.9(b)(i)_ shall be based on the Parent
Closing Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 1.9(b)(i)_, in lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock in respect of Award Consideration, Parent shall pay to any
individual who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (x)
the Parent Closing Price by (y) the fraction of a share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to
which such individual would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
this  _Section 1.9(b)(i)_.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that was granted on or after the

 



5  date of this Agreement shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted as of the Effective Time into
a restricted stock unit award (" _Assumed RSU Award_ "), on the same terms
and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each
such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect
to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio
(rounded to the nearest whole share).  

(c) _Certain Defined Terms_.

 

(i) " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the sum of (x)
0.30605 and (y) the quotient of $17.50 divided by the Parent Closing Price,
rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth.

 

(ii) " _Parent Closing Price_ " shall mean the average, rounded to the
nearest one ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock
on the NYSE as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five full NYSE
trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Date.

(d) _Reservation of Shares_. Parent has taken all corporate actions
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock upon the exercise of the Assumed Stock Options and satisfaction
of the Company RSU Awards and the Assumed RSU Awards. As soon as
practicable following the Closing, Parent shall file a registration statement
on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the issuance
of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options and
underlying the Assumed RSU Awards and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Assumed Stock Options and Assumed RSU
Awards remain outstanding.

1.10 _Intended Tax Treatment_. It is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

1.11 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by the Company Stockholders who, in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_ "), (i) have not voted in favor of
adopting this Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares, (iii) have otherwise complied in all respects with
the Appraisal Rights Provisions, and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn,
lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting
Stockholders_ "), will not be converted into the Merger Consideration, but at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, shall be

 



6  cancelled and shall cease to exist and each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than such rights to
be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares provided under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Company Common
Stock held by the Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall
thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
relating thereto, without interest, in the manner provided in _Section 2.1_
and _Section 2.2_. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall
not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record prior to the Effective Time).

(b) The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (i) prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received
by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands for appraisal.

 

(c) Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled under
the Appraisal Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall
receive payment therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Entity
(but only after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be canceled.

 

1.12 _Limitation on Cash Consideration Payable to the Company
Stockholders._  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent
determines that the Threshold Percentage (determined without regard to this
sentence) would be less than 42.5%, then an amount of cash otherwise payable
to the Company Stockholders under this Agreement, equal to the amount of cash
which would be necessary to cause the recomputed Threshold Percentage to
equal 42.5%, shall instead be payable in an equivalent amount of Parent Common
Stock (with each share of Parent Common Stock valued for this purpose using
the Applicable Stock Value), provided that any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share.

 

(a) The term " _Threshold Percentage_ " shall mean the quotient,
expressed as a percentage, obtained by dividing (i) the Aggregate Stock
Consideration by (ii) the sum of the Aggregate Stock Consideration plus the
Aggregate Cash Amount.

 

(b) The term " _Aggregate Stock Consideration_ " shall mean the product
of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the
Applicable Stock Value.

 



7 (c) The term " _Applicable Stock Value_ " shall mean $57.18, which is
the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock quoted on the NYSE, as
reported by The Wall Street Journal, for the last trading day immediately
prior to the date hereof. 

(d) The term " _Aggregate Cash Amount_ " shall mean the aggregate amount
of cash to be paid to the Company Stockholders (including any Dissenting
Stockholders) in exchange for their Company Common Stock. Solely for purposes
of this _Section 1.12(d)_, Dissenting Stockholders shall be deemed to
receive an amount in cash equal to $35.00 per share (it being understood that
the actual amount that would be payable to any Dissenting Stockholder
following completion of an appraisal proceeding would be determined pursuant
to such appraisal proceeding in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware law).

 

1.13 _Governance_. On or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board
shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Parent Board
to be increased by three (3) members and, at the Effective Time, the Parent
Board shall cause the vacancies created thereby to be filled by individuals
reasonably designated by the Company prior to the Effective Time, provided
that such designees satisfy the requirements imposed by Parents corporate
governance policies and procedures, including the approval of Parents
corporate governance and nominating committee, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that, to the extent any vacancy exists on the Parent Board at the
Effective Time, Parent may elect to fill such vacancy through the appointment
of a Company designee in lieu of increasing the size of the Parent Board, to
the extent permitted by Parents Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, so
long as the result is to include on the Parent Board, as of the
Effective Time, three (3) Company designees.

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and non-certificated
shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") for the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , (i)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to
deliver the aggregate stock portion of the Merger Consideration, (ii)
immediately available funds equal to any dividends or distributions payable in
accordance with  _Section 2.2(b)_, (iii) immediately available funds equal
to the aggregate Cash Consideration and (iv) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and paid pursuant to  _Section
2.2(e)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares) (the foregoing items (i) - (iv) are referred to
collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the
Company and Parent may reasonably agree, for use in effecting 

 



8  delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent. Exchange
of any Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parents
customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (A) one or more shares of Parent
Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 1.6_ and (B) a check in the amount equal to the Cash
Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 1.6_ and this _Article II_ , including cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on
any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II._ After the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid, without any interest
thereon, with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented
by such Certificate, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender, with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is
to be issued in, or any cash is paid to, a name other than that in which the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are
registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance or payment thereof that
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment or issuance in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Article II_.

 



9 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no certificates or scrips representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for
exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the
Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the
Parent Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable in
accordance with _Section 2.2(b_) in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock, as the case may be, such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Exchange Agent or
any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(h) To the extent that any shares of Company Common Stock are in
book-entry form, references in this Agreement to Certificates or certificated
shares shall be deemed to also refer to such book entry shares.

2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ hereof and any other cash
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the
case may be, and timely paid over to the relevant Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the

 



10  holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be.

warranties to, and agreements with, Parent and Merger Sub and (ii)
acknowledges and agrees that, for the avoidance of doubt, references to the

Adverse Effect. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
is in corporate good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in

thereto, that were or are required to be filed with the SEC, including, but
not limited to, Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K (collectively, the "
_Company SEC Reports_ "). All of the Company SEC Reports are publicly

Company SEC Reports and none of the Company SEC Reports is the subject of any
ongoing SEC review. There are no SEC inquiries or investigations,

 



14  other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal investigations
pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened, in each case involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming the accuracy of Parents
representation set forth in _Section 4.24_, the Company SEC Reports (i) were
or will be filed or furnished on a timely basis, (ii) at the time filed or
furnished, were or will be prepared in compliance as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and (iii) did not or will
not at the time they were or are filed or furnished contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in such Company SEC Reports or necessary in order to make
the statements in such Company SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and all applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of

Exchange Act) that are designed and effective to ensure that all information
(both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and are also designed and effective to ensure
that all such information is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (iii) has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required
by applicable law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Report that is a

the " _Company Material Contracts_ ") is a valid, binding and enforceable

Companys knowledge, none of the other parties thereto have, violated in
any respect any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and

both would constitute a default under the provisions of any lease agreement
relating to any property leased, subleased or licensed by the Company (the "
_Company_

 



20   __ _Leases_ ") which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any of the foregoing. Each
of the Company Leases is in full force and effect and is enforceable against
the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the Companys
knowledge, against each other party thereto, in accordance with its terms and
shall not cease to be in full force and effect as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries leases, subleases or licenses any material real property to any
Person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries. All plants, facilities and
operating equipment owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
are in a state of repair so as to be adequate for their current and

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

person or entity whose liability for such Environmental Claim has been
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) against any real or personal property or
operations that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns, leases or
manages, in whole or in part, or, to the knowledge of the Company, formerly
owned, leased or managed, in whole or in part, except in the case of clause
(i), (ii) or (iii) for such Environmental Claims that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

of any Materials of Environmental Concern that would be reasonably likely to

service marks, trademark and service mark applications, copyright
registrations and applications for copyright registration, patents and patent
applications and domain name registrations currently owned by the Company and
its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be

Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries own, or have a right to use pursuant to a license agreement, the
Intellectual Property used in, or necessary for, the operation of the business

23 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in (i) the Parent SEC Reports filed since January 1, 2010
but at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement,
excluding any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly predictive or forward-
looking in nature (provided, however, that any disclosures in such Parent SEC
Reports that are the subject of this clause (i) shall be deemed to qualify a
representation or warranty only if the relevance of such disclosure to such
representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure, and provided further, that the disclosures in Parent SEC Reports
shall not be deemed to qualify any representations or warranties made in
_Section 4.2_) or (ii) the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to Company
on the date hereof (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), the Section numbers
of which are numbered to correspond to the Section numbers of this Agreement
to which they refer (provided, however, that an item disclosed in any Section
shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section of this
Agreement only to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other
Section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in corporate good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated

and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of Parent and the Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability
Company Agreement of Merger Sub, copies of which have previously been made
available to the Company, are true, correct and complete copies of such
documents as currently in effect.

(c) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The issued and
outstanding limited liability company interest of Merger Sub, is validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and is owned, beneficially and of record,
by Parent, free and clear of any Encumbrance. Except for obligations and
liabilities incurred in connection with its formation and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred,
directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities

 



24  or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or
entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person that would impair
in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Merger Sub, as the
case may be, to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(d) The Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 4.1(d)_  of the Parent
Disclosure Letter attached hereto are the only Subsidiaries of Parent. Each of
Parents Subsidiaries is a corporation or a limited liability company, as

corporate or other similar power and authority to own, lease or operate all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parents Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased, or operated
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good standing has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For the purpose of this 
_Section 4.1(d)_, the term Subsidiaries shall include only "significant
subsidiaries" (as such term is defined Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X as
promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act) of Parent.

(a) Since January 1, 2008, Parent has timely filed all reports,
registrations, statements, prospectuses, forms, schedules and other documents,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
were or are required to be filed with the SEC, including, but not limited
to, Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K (collectively, the " _Parent SEC

Parent SEC Reports (i) were or will be filed or furnished on a timely basis,
(ii) at the time filed or furnished, were or will be prepared in compliance as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports, and
(iii) did not or will not at the time they were or are filed or furnished
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated in such Parent SEC Reports or necessary in order to

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and all applicable listing and corporate governance rules

sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (A) transactions are executed
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (B)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial

(C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general
or specific authorization; (ii) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) that are designed and effective to ensure that all information
(both financial and non-financial) relating to Parent, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and are also designed and effective to ensure that all such
information is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of Parent by others within those entities as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act; (iii) has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents
disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable
law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Report that is a report on Form
10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation; and,
(iv) based on Parents managements most recently completed

 



28  evaluation of Parents internal controls over financial reporting prior to

weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
does not have any knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting.

") (a) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto (including Regulation S-X), (b) were prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved and at the dates
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements
or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act), and (c) fairly presented the consolidated financial
position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows and changes
in stockholders equity for the periods indicated, consistent with the books
and records of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal year-end
adjustments which were not or will not be material in amount or effect.
Parent has not, between September 30, 2010 and the date of this Agreement,
made or adopted any material change in its accounting methods, practices or
policies in effect on September 30, 2010. The consolidated, audited balance

reflected or reserved against in the Parent Balance Sheet, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,

balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes
thereto), except liabilities or obligations (i) that were incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30,
2010, (ii) that were incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that are not material in the aggregate or (iii) that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or
arrangement (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or effect of such
contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in
the Parent Financial Statements or the Parent SEC Reports.

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September 30,
2010, through the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses in all material

 



29  respects in the ordinary course of business in a consistent manner since
such date and there has not been any Circumstance that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

accounting and other professional fees payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), all
of which will be paid by Parent.

the subject of _Section 4.18_, as of the date of this Agreement, (i) there
are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against,
relating to or affecting, nor to the knowledge of Parent are there any
Governmental Authority investigations, inquiries or audits pending or

authorizations, approvals and similar consents, approvals, licenses, orders or
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted (the " _Parent

Governmental Approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

together with any Contract guaranteeing indebtedness of a third party
(collectively, the " _Parent Indebtedness Agreements_ "). Each (i) "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act) of Parent and (ii) Company Indebtedness
Agreement (the Contracts referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) the " _Parent
Material Contracts_ ") is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent or such Subsidiary and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
in default or violation of any Parent Material Contract, except for any
defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge
of Parent, no other party to any Parent Material Contract is in breach of or
default under the terms of any Parent Material Contract where such breach or
default has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

knowledge, none of the other parties thereto have, violated in any respect
any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or
condition exists, which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a default under the provisions of any lease agreement relating to
any property leased, subleased or licensed by Parent (the " _Parent Leases_
") which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice of any of the foregoing. Each of the Parent
Leases is in full force and effect and is enforceable against Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to Parents knowledge, against each
other party thereto, in accordance with its terms and shall not cease to be
in full force and effect as a result of the transactions

 



33  contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
leases, subleases or licenses any material real property to any Person other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries. All plants, facilities and operating
equipment owned or leased by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are in a state
of repair so as to be adequate for their current and intended uses, except
where the failure to be in such state of repair would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.18 _Environmental Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2008 has
been and is in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, except where
the failure to be in such compliance, individually or in the aggregate, has

where the failure to obtain such Environmental Permits, of such Environmental
Permits to be in good standing or, where applicable, of a renewal application
to have been timely filed and be pending or to be in such compliance,

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

in whole or in part, except in the case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii) for such
Environmental Claims that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

action such that the provisions of any anti-takeover laws and regulations of
any Governmental Authority, including Section 14-2-1132 of the GBCC and any
provisions of Parents Certificate of Incorporation relating to

to this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
To the knowledge of Parent, no other Takeover Laws or provisions in the

other vote of holders of securities of Parent is required by Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Parent, the Bylaws of Parent or otherwise in
order for Parent to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated

4.21 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct
and complete fully-executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of
January 23, 2011, by and among Parent, WF Investments Holdings, LLC, Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, SunTrust Bank,
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-
Boerenleenbank B.A., "Rabobank Nederland", New York Branch, including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letter, in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (the " _Commitment Letter_ "), together with a
redacted copy of the fee letter relating thereto (the " _Fee Letter_ ").
Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, each of the parties thereto (other than Parent) have severally
agreed and committed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision of
such funds as set forth therein, the " _Financing_ ") for the purposes set
forth in such Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter has not been amended,
restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of this Agreement,
and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not
been withdrawn, modified or rescinded (and no party thereto indicated an
intent to so withdraw, modify or rescind) in any respect prior to the date of
this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights and subject to general principles of equity. As
of the date of this Agreement, except for the Fee Letter and an engagement
letter with respect to the Financing, there are no side letters or other
contracts or arrangements related to the Financing other than the Commitment
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent
or contingencies relating to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. The net proceeds
contemplated from the Financing, together with cash on hand of Parent and
Merger Sub on the Closing Date, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for (i)
the payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration and any other amounts required
to be paid pursuant to _Article II_ , the aggregate amount of cash to be
deposited pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_ in respect of the Reserved Company
Common Stock, and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to the
terms of _Section 1.9_ in respect of the Company RSU Awards, (ii) the
funding of any required refinancings or repayments of any existing
indebtedness of the Company or Parent in connection with the Merger or the
Financing, and (iii) the payment of all fees and expenses and other
payment obligations required to be paid or satisfied by Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Entity in connection with the Merger and the Financing. As
of the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which would
constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a default) on the part of Parent under the
Commitment Letter or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other
party to the Commitment Letter and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub do not have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the Financing or any other funds necessary for the
satisfaction of all of Parents obligations under this Agreement, the 

 



35  funding of any required refinancings or repayments of any existing
indebtedness of the Company or Parent in connection with the Merger or the
Financing and the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection therewith will not be available to Parent and Merger
Sub on the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid all commitment
fees or other fees required to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the Commitment Letter. Each of Parent and Merger Sub understands
that the obligations to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not conditioned upon the availability of the Financing to Parent and
Merger Sub at the Closing.

4.22 _Intellectual Property_. All registered trademarks and
registered service marks, trademark and service mark applications, copyright
registrations and applications for copyright registration, patents and patent
applications and domain name registrations currently owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in
full force and effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) Parent and its
Subsidiaries own, or have a right to use pursuant to a license agreement, the
Intellectual Property used in, or necessary for, the operation of the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and (ii) the
operation of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted does not Infringe any Intellectual Property rights of any third
party. Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, no claim or demand has been given in writing to
Parent or any Subsidiary that the operation of the business of Parent or any
Subsidiary as currently conducted Infringes the Intellectual Property rights
of any third party. Except as set forth in _Section 4.22_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, no Encumbrances exist with respect to the Intellectual
Property used in, or necessary for, the operation of the business of Parent
and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. Except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, to Parents
knowledge no Person is engaged in any activity that Infringes
the Intellectual Property rights that are owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

4.23 _Insurance_. Except for failures to maintain insurance or self-
insurance that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, from January
1, 2009, through the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries has been continuously insured with financially responsible
insurers or has self-insured, in each case in such amounts and with respect to
such risks and losses as are customary for companies conducting the business
conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries during such time period in the
jurisdiction in which Parent conducts its business. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice of any pending or threatened
cancellation, termination or premium increase with respect to any insurance
policy of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except with respect to any
cancellation, termination or premium increase that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries to be
included or incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Form S-4, and any other documents filed with the SEC in connection herewith,

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not

which such statement is made. The Form S-4 will comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act and the rule and regulations thereunder in all material
respects.

Material Contracts, arrangements or understandings between (a) Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (b) any Affiliate of Parent (other
than any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries), on the other hand, of the type
that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

4.26 _No Rights Plan_. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison

a party or otherwise bound.

the opinion of Wells Fargo Securities, to the effect that, subject to
the assumptions, qualifications and other matters set forth therein, as of
the date thereof, the Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement is
fair to Parent from a financial point of view. A correct and complete signed

separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, disposition or
hold separate of any asset, in each case if such sale, divestiture, license,
disposition or hold separate with respect thereto would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect (after giving effect to the
Merger), or (B) conduct or agree to conduct its business in any particular
manner if such conduct or agreement with respect thereto would, individually

Effective Time, the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate in all respects as
requested by Parent in connection with any such sale, divestiture, license,

Effective Time.

6.4 _No Solicitation  Company_.

(a) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, cease
and terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Person with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company

heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to a Company

49  or for the benefit of the Company to promptly return or destroy all
information, documents, and materials relating to the Company Acquisition
Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations or affairs
heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such
Person or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any
confidentiality agreement with such Person.

or facilitate the submission of any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or may lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Company

Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the properties,
books and records of the Company to, any Person (other than Parent or Merger
Sub) in connection with or in response to any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) enter into any letter of intent or Contract providing for, relating to or
in connection with, any Company Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that may
lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement as contemplated by _Section 6.4(c)_), or that requires the Company
to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (v) approve, adopt, endorse
or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, (vi) take any action to make the
provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
(including any transaction under, or a third party becoming an "interested
shareholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL), or any restrictive provision of
any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a
Company Acquisition Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the
Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that
may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent or any of
Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions) or (vii) resolve, propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.4(b)_, from the date hereof and
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval, if (i) the Company
or its Representatives receive an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
receiving advice from its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal,
(ii) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after receiving advice from
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to take
such action with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal would reasonably
be likely to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary obligations
to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law and (iii) such Company
Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in material breach of this _Section
6.4_, then the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish
information to the third party making such Company Acquisition Proposal (a "
_Company Qualified Bidder_ "), _provided_ _that_ (A) the Company receives from
the Company Qualified Bidder an executed confidentiality agreement (the
confidentiality terms of which are no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement), (B) such confidentiality
agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company in any way from
complying with this Agreement, including prohibiting the Company from
providing

 



50  information or written materials to Parent and (C) all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person; and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the Company Qualified Bidder and its Representatives with
respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section 6.4(e)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee of the Company Board may (i) withdraw or
withhold, amend, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, withhold,
amend, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend any Company
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend
any Company Acquisition Proposal (any action described in  _clause (i)_ ,
_(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , whether taken by the Company Board or any committee
thereof, being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.4(d)_, at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholders Approval, the Company Board may in
response to a Company Superior Proposal that did not result from a material
breach by Company of this _Section 6.4_, (x) cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ in order to concurrently enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal or
(y) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case, if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after receiving advice from the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so
would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of the Company Boards
fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such actions may only be taken (A) at a time
that is after the third (3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company that the Company Board is prepared to take
such action (the " _Company Subsequent Determination Notice_ "), which notice
will specify the terms of the applicable Company Acquisition Proposal and
identify the Person making such Company Superior Proposal, (B) if, at the end
of such period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after taking into
account all amendments or revisions committed to by Parent and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Company Acquisition Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal, and (C) if,
in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_, the Company pays
the Termination Amount under  _Section 8.2(c)(ii_) and _Section 8.2(d)_
concurrently with and as a condition to such termination. During any such
three (3) Business Day period, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the
Company one or more counterproposals to such Company Acquisition Proposal,
and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to meet and negotiate with
the Company and its Representatives, who shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Company Superior
Proposal. If a Company Superior Proposal is revised, including any revision to
price, then the Company shall deliver to Parent a new Company Subsequent
Determination Notice and again comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.4(e)_ with respect to such revised Company Superior Proposal, on each
occasion on which a revised Company Superior Proposal is submitted, except
that the three (3) Business Day notice period shall be reduced to two (2)
Business Days.

 

(f) From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
orally and in writing of the

 



51  receipt of any _bona-fide_ inquiries, discussions, negotiations, proposals
or expressions of interest with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
including providing the identity of the third party making, submitting,
inquiring about or expressing interest with respect to such Company
Acquisition Proposal, and (i) if it is in writing, a copy of such Company
Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreements and other written
material setting forth the terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) if oral, a reasonable summary thereof that is made or
submitted by any third party during the period between the date hereof and the
Closing. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and
timely basis of the status and details of any such Company Acquisition
Proposal and with respect to any change to the material terms of any such
Company Acquisition Proposal within twenty-four (24) hours of any such
change. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or shall become party
to any Contract, in each case, that prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Company Acquisition
Proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after receiving
advice from its outside legal counsel, failing to take such action would
be inconsistent with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law. In
addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a
factually accurate public statement by the Company that merely describes the
Companys receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto, any statement to the effect that the Company
is discussing or evaluating such Company Acquisition Proposal, or any "stop,
look and listen" communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
of the Exchange Act or any similar communication to the Company Stockholders,
shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ "
shall mean any bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal (with all
references to 20% in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal being
treated as references to 50% for these purposes) made by a third party that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after receiving advice from its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, would be more favorable to the
Company Stockholders than the Merger, taking into account (i) any proposal by
Parent to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement, (ii) the identity of
the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the terms,
conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation and legal, financial, and
regulatory aspects of such Company Acquisition Proposal.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Acquisition Proposal_
" shall mean any inquiry, proposal, offer, plan, arrangement or other
expression or indication of interest for any transaction or series of related
transactions involving (i) a merger, tender offer, exchange offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, liquidation, dissolution,
business combination or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving
the Company, (ii) a sale, lease, license, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other acquisition or disposition of assets that constitute or
account for at least 20% of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Company Material Business_ "), or (iii)
a purchase, tender offer or other acquisition (including by

 



52  way of merger, consolidation, stock exchange or otherwise) of beneficial
ownership (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement
having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder) of securities representing 20% or more
of the voting power of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that constitutes
a Company Material Business; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the term "Company
Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _No Solicitation  Parent_

(a) Upon execution of this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, cease and
terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with

heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of Parent to promptly return or

Acquisition Proposal or to Parent or its businesses, operations or affairs
heretofore furnished by Parent or any of its Representatives to such Person or
any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person.

facilitate the submission of any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or
offer that constitutes, or may lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Parent

of intent or Contract providing for, relating to or in connection with, any
Parent Acquisition Proposal or any proposal that may lead to a Parent

its obligations hereunder or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (v) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction under,
or a third party becoming an "interested shareholder" under, Section 14-2-1132
of the GBCC), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in Parents Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, inapplicable to
any transactions contemplated by a Parent Acquisition Proposal (and, to the
extent permitted thereunder, Parent shall promptly take all steps necessary to
terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person
other than Company or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such provisions)
or (vii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(b)_, from the date hereof and

53  receiving advice from its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Parent Superior Proposal,
(ii) the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after receiving advice from
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to take
such action with respect to such Parent Acquisition Proposal would reasonably
be likely to result in a breach of the Parent Boards fiduciary obligations
to the Parent Stockholders under applicable Law and (iii) such Parent
Acquisition Proposal was not solicited material breach of this _Section 6.5_,
then Parent may take the following actions: (x) furnish information to the
third party making such Parent Acquisition Proposal (a " _Parent Qualified
Bidder_ "), _provided_ _that_ (A) Parent receives from the Parent Qualified
Bidder an executed confidentiality agreement (the confidentiality terms of
which are no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement), (B) such confidentiality agreement may not include
any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with Parent and may
not restrict Parent in any way from complying with this Agreement, including
prohibiting Parent from providing information or written materials to the
Company and (C) all such information has previously been provided to the
Company or is provided to the Company concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person; and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
the Parent Qualified Bidder and its Representatives with respect to the Parent
Acquisition Proposal. 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section 6.5(e)_, neither the
Parent Board nor any committee of the Parent Board may (i) withdraw or
withhold, amend, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, withhold,
amend, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the Company, the Parent
Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend any Parent
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend
any Parent Acquisition Proposal (any action described in _clause (i)_ ,
_(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , whether taken by the Parent Board or any committee
thereof, being referred to as a " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(d)_, at any time prior to the
receipt of the Parent Stockholders Approval, the Parent Board may in response
to a Parent Superior Proposal that did not result from a material breach by
Parent of this _Section 6.5_, (x) cause Parent to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_ in order to concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal or (y) effect a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case, if the Parent Board determines
in good faith, after receiving advice from Parents outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that failure to do so would reasonably be likely to result
in a breach of the Parent Boards fiduciary obligations to the Parent
Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such actions
may only be taken (A) at a time that is after the third (3rd) Business Day
following the Companys receipt of written notice from Parent that the Parent
Board is prepared to take such action (the " _Parent Subsequent Determination
Notice_ "), which notice will specify the terms of the applicable Parent
Acquisition Proposal and identify the Person making such Parent
Superior Proposal, (B) if, at the end of such period, the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after taking into account all amendments or
revisions committed to by the Company and after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal
remains a Parent Superior Proposal, and (C) if, in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 8.1(j)_, Parent pays the Parent Termination Amount under
_Section 8.2(c)(iv)_ concurrently with and as a condition to such
termination. During any such three (3) Business Day period, Company shall be
entitled to deliver to Parent one or more counterproposals to such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, and Parent shall give the 

 



54  Company the opportunity to meet and negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives, who shall negotiate in good faith with the Company regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by the Company in response to such Parent Superior Proposal. If a
Parent Superior Proposal is revised, including any revision to price, then
Parent shall deliver to the Company a new Parent Subsequent Determination
Notice and again comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_ with
respect to such revised Parent Superior Proposal, on each occasion on which a
revised Parent Superior Proposal is submitted, except that the three (3)
Business Day notice period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days.

 

(f) From and after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
notify the Company promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
orally and in writing of the receipt of any _bona-fide_ inquiries,
discussions, negotiations, proposals or expressions of interest with respect
to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, including providing the identity of the
third party making, submitting, inquiring about or expressing interest with
respect to such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and (i) if it is in writing, a
copy of such Parent Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreements and
other written material setting forth the terms and conditions of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if oral, a reasonable summary thereof that is
made or submitted by any third party during the period between the date
hereof and the Closing. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
prompt and timely basis of the status and details of any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and with respect to any change to the material terms of
any such Parent Acquisition Proposal within twenty-four (24) hours of any such
change. Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is or shall become party to any
Contract, in each case, that prohibits Parent from providing such information
to the Company.

 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall be deemed to prohibit
Parent from complying with Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal if, in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board, after receiving
advice from its outside legal counsel, failing to take such action would be
inconsistent with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law. In
addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a
factually accurate public statement by Parent that merely describes Parents
receipt of a Parent Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto, any statement to the effect that Parent is discussing or
evaluating such Parent Acquisition Proposal, or any "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Parent Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act or any similar communication to the Parent Stockholders, shall not
constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Superior Proposal_ "
shall mean any bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal (with all
references to 20% in the definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal being
treated as references to 50% for these purposes) made by a third party that
the Parent Board determines in good faith, after receiving advice from its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, would be more favorable to the
Parent Stockholders than the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account (i) any proposal by the
Company to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement, (ii) the identity of
the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the terms, 

 



55  conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation and legal, financial, and
regulatory aspects of such Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Acquisition Proposal_
" shall mean any inquiry, proposal, offer, plan, arrangement or other
expression or indication of interest for any transaction or series of related
transactions involving (i) a merger, tender offer, exchange
offer, recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, liquidation,
dissolution, business combination or consolidation, or any similar
transaction, involving Parent, (ii) a sale, lease, license, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, transfer or other acquisition or disposition of assets that
constitute or account for at least 20% of the consolidated net revenues, net
income or assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Parent Material Business_ "), or (iii) a
purchase, tender offer or other acquisition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, stock exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term
"beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning
assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of securities representing 20% or more of the voting
power of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that constitutes a Parent Material
Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Parent Acquisition Proposal"
shall not include the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the issuance of the Parent Common Stock contemplated
hereby).

6.6 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 8.1_, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other Representatives of the other party, reasonable access during
normal business hours to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments
and records upon reasonable prior notice. Each of Parent and the Company
shall also provide the other party with such access to the appropriate
individuals (including management personnel, attorneys, accountants and other
professionals) for discussion of such partys business, properties, prospects
and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. No investigation
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect any representation or warranty in
this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto. No party shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to
violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work
product privilege. Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the
other party or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall
comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with,
all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



56 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that any rights to indemnification
or exculpation now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or
agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided for in the
respective organizational documents, in effect as of the date hereof shall
continue in full force and effect (and with respect to the Surviving Entity,
shall be reflected in the applicable organizational documents of such entity),
for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity to honor and fulfill such rights to indemnification
and exculpation and such limitations on personal liability. During such
period, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit the Surviving Entity to, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who at any
time on or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless
such modification is required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made either prior to the Effective
Time or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect
of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all
such claims.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to either (i) cause to
be obtained a "tail" insurance policy with respect to Companys and its
Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance as in effect as of the Effective Time (a " _D andO Tail
Policy_"), which DandO Tail Policy (A) shall have a claims period of at least
six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to the
Indemnified Parties covered by the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance as of the
Effective Time and (B) shall contain terms with respect to scope of coverage
and amount no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those in the Companys
and its Subsidiaries existing directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance policies as of the Effective Time, or (ii)
maintain the existing officers and directors liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided
that Parent may cause the Surviving Entity to substitute therefor policies of
at least the same scope of coverage and amount and containing terms and
conditions that are generally not less favorable, in the aggregate, to the
Indemnified Parties) for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Entity
be required to expend in the aggregate in excess of 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage (multiplied by six in the
case of the six-year "tail" policy contemplated by clause (i)), and if such
premium would at any time exceed such amount, then Parent or the Surviving
Entity shall maintain insurance policies which provide the maximum and best
coverage available at an annual premium equal to 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage (multiplied by six in the case
of the six-year "tail" policy contemplated by clause (i)). In lieu of the
foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to, on or after the Effective Time,
a six-year prepaid DandO Tail Policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time providing each of the Indemnified Parties with
the coverage described in this _Section 6.7(b)_ for an aggregate premium not
in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by

 



57  the Company for such coverage multiplied by six. _Section 6.7(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the current premium paid by the Company
for such insurance.

 

(c) The obligations under this _Section 6.7_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies without the consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this 
_Section 6.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
6.7_ and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets, then, and in each such
case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Entity with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Parent.

 

6.9 _Publicity_. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to,
and in accordance with, _Section 6.4_, _Section 6.5_ or _Article VIII_ , so
long as this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company shall, or
shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of
any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise
make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as may be required by applicable
Law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange, in which event such party
shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to the
other party in connection with any disclosure contemplated by  _Section 6.4_
or _Section 6.5_ or any disclosure of Parent or Merger Sub in response
thereto or in connection therewith.

6.10 _Rule 16b-3 Actions_. Parent and the Company agree that, in
order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors
of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that such Persons not be subject to a risk
of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this _Section 6.10_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any

 



58  dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock, grants of Company RSU Awards
and Company Stock Options resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of shares of Parent Common
Stock, Assumed Stock Options and Assumed RSU Awards resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to Parent following the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. 

6.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent covenants and agrees with the Company, on behalf
of itself and its Subsidiaries, that it shall take all action necessary to
ensure that as of the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub will have funds, in
the aggregate, sufficient for (i) the payment of the aggregate Cash
Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Article
II_ , the aggregate amount of cash to be deposited pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)_ in respect of the Reserved Company Common Stock, and the aggregate

of the Company RSU Awards, (ii) the funding of any required refinancings or
repayments of any existing indebtedness of the Company or Parent in connection
with the Merger or the Financing, and (iii) the payment of all fees and
expenses and other payment obligations required to be paid or satisfied by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity in connection with the Merger and
the Financing.

 

(b) The Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their respective
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to, provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent with reasonable notice in
connection with the Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) provide
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Financing
Sources that is reasonably available to the Company and is customary for
completion of the Financing by the Financing Sources (including audited
consolidated financial statements of the Company covering the three (3)
fiscal years immediately preceding the Closing for which audited consolidated
financial statements are currently available, unaudited financial statements
(excluding footnotes) for any interim period or periods of the Company
ended after the date of the most recent audited financial statements and at
least 40 days prior to the Closing Date and information regarding the

materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) cooperate with the marketing
efforts for any component of the Financing (including consenting to the use of
the Companys 

 



59  and its Subsidiaries logos; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), (v) execute and deliver (or use reasonable best
efforts to obtain from its advisors), and cause its Subsidiaries to execute
and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors),
credit agreements and other loan documents, currency or interest hedging
agreements, customary certificates, accounting comfort letters (including
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the Financing), or other documents and instruments ancillary to the Financing
as may be reasonably requested by Parent as customary in connection with the
Financing, including any amendments of any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries existing credit agreements, currency or interest hedging
agreements; _provided_ that no obligation of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall be effective under credit agreements, loan documents or
currency or interest hedging arrangements or amendments to such existing
arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries until the Effective Time,
(vi) use its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have its independent
accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance, (vii) use
its reasonable best efforts to permit any cash and marketable securities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to be made available to Parent and/or Merger

using cash and marketable securities in the ordinary course or from taking any
action not prohibited by _Section 5.1_, (viii) provide customary
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution
of information to prospective lenders and containing a representation to the
Financing Sources that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do
not include material non-public information about the Company or its

in reasonable time to review and provide such representations, and (ix)
cooperate reasonably with Financing Sources due diligence, to the extent
customary and reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time occurs,
neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, nor their respective
Representatives, shall (i) be required to take any action in the capacity of a
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the
Financing (or alternative financing that Parent may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) if such Representative
believes such action would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties, (ii)
be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (iii) have any
liability or any obligation under any credit agreement or any related document
or any other agreement or document related to the Financing (or alternative
financing that Parent may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) or (iv) be required to incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing that
Parent may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
actually incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 6.11_, (ii) acknowledges and
agrees that, except for obligations of the Companys Subsidiaries from and
after the Effective Time, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any Person under, the Financing (or alternative financing that Parent may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
and (iii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and

 



60  their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by any of them prior to the Effective Time in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized
in connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries and information provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their Representatives), except in the event that such losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses arise out of or result from the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives.

(d) In the event that the Commitment Letter is amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, including as a result of obtaining
alternative financing, or if Parent substitutes other debt or equity financing
for all or a portion of the Financing, the Company shall comply with its
covenants in _Section 6.11(b)_ with respect to the Commitment Letter as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such
other debt or equity financing to the same extent that the Company would have
been obligated to comply with respect to the Financing, _provided_ , that the
Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified
and/or such other debt or equity financing shall not (A) add new (or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, any existing) conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth
in the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto on
terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (any such
agreements the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ "), (B) adversely impact
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements, or (C) prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This _Section 6.11_ shall be deemed to apply
to the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified and/or such other debt or equity financing and references to the
Financing shall be deemed to refer instead to such alternative financing.

 

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding
the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 6.11_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having
or reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or (ii) that it believes would or
would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to
comply with this _Section 6.12_ shall not constitute the failure of any
condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be, or material breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied.

 



61 6.13 _Litigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, each party shall notify the other parties promptly if and after
it receives notice of any Actions instituted or threatened against Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective directors, officers or
Affiliates, including by any shareholder of the Company, before any court or
Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement, the Merger, the Financing
or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in
connection with such transactions. Until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective Time, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
of any Action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not settle any such Action without
Parents written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 

6.14 _Stock De-Registration_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its shares of common stock to no longer be quoted on the NYSE
and to be de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

the shares of Parent Common Stock which are to be issued to the holders of
Company Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger to be listed on the NYSE.

6.16 _Standstill Agreements_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination
Date, neither Parent nor the Company shall terminate, amend, modify or waive
any provision of any confidentiality agreement relating to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal or a Company Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be, or
any standstill agreement to which Parent, Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a party (other than any between the Company and Parent), in
each case unless the Parent Board or the Company Board, as applicable,
determines after consulting with legal counsel that the failure to terminate,
amend, modify or waive such provision would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that
neither Parent nor the Company shall enforce any provision of any
such agreement that would prohibit a third party from requesting such
termination, amendment modification or waiver. Subject to the foregoing,
during such period, each of Parent and the Company agrees to enforce the
provisions of any such agreements, including seeking to obtain injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such agreements, and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof in any court of the U.S. or any state thereof having
jurisdiction.

 

6.17 _Actions Regarding Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If Section 203 of
the DGCL or any other potentially applicable anti-takeover or similar Law or
provision in the Companys governing documents is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such other
actions as may be required so that the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

6.18 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting and subject to
the parties rights and obligations under this Agreement, the parties
understand and agree that nothing

 



62  contained in this Agreement shall give any party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control the operations of any other party prior to the Effective
Time.

 

6.19 _Cooperation on Certain Matters_. After the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall, subject to
applicable Law, confer with each other on a regular and continued basis
regarding the general status of the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and integration
planning matters and communicate and consult with such Persons identified by
Parent to the Company or by the Company to Parent, as applicable, with respect
to the foregoing.

 

6.20 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor
all Company Benefit Plans, Company Pension Plans and Company Other Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, provided that nothing herein shall limit the right of the Surviving
Entity or Parent to amend or terminate such plans, arrangements and
agreements in accordance with their terms. For a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remains
employed after the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) base salary or
wages (as applicable), annual bonus opportunities, and employer matching
contributions to a defined contribution retirement plan that are no less
favorable than the base salary or wages (as applicable), annual bonus
opportunities and employer matching contributions to a defined contribution
retirement plan provided to such Company Employee immediately before
the Effective Time, and (ii) equity award grants on a basis no less favorable
to such Company Employee than the equity award grants made to similarly
situated employees of Parent (other than Company Employees). For the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2011, Parent
agrees to cause the Surviving Entity to maintain health benefits and welfare
benefits (other than severance benefits, which are addressed below) for each
Company Employee at levels that are, in the aggregate, at least substantially
comparable to such benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, (A) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Entity to provide Company Employees whose employment terminates during the
one-year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits in
accordance with the Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation Severance Pay Plan
for Salaried Employees (the " _Company Severance Plan_ ") as in effect at the
Effective Time and (B) severance benefits provided to Company Employees under
the Company Severance Plan during the one-year period following the
Effective Time shall be determined without taking into account any reduction
after the Effective Time in compensation paid to Company Employees.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time,
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each

 



63  Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan, Company Pension Plan or Company
Other Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause any deductibles, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
paid by Company Employees under any of the Old Plans providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits in the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs to be credited towards such limits under the New Plans
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits.

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to
each Company Employee employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and then participating in any bonus plans established by the Company with
respect to the Companys fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 (the " _2011
Bonus Plans_"), a bonus under the 2011 Bonus Plans for the period from
January 1, 2011 through the Closing Date (the " _Bonus Period_ ") equal to the
greater of (A) such Company Employees bonus entitlement for the Bonus Period
under the 2011 Bonus Plans based on the level of achievement of the
applicable performance goals for the period beginning on January 1, 2011 and
ending as of the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the
Effective Time occurs (or as of the end of the month in which the Effective
Time occurs if the Effective Time coincides with the end of the month) and
assuming that the Companys performance for the period from such month end
through the Closing Date is equal to the level of achievement for the period
through such month end, and (B) such Company Employees bonus entitlement for
the Bonus Period under the 2011 Bonus Plans assuming target performance
through the Closing Date. Any determinations with respect to bonus awards
shall be made consistent with the Companys past practice. The intent of this
provision is to provide each Company Employee with a partial year bonus under
the 2011 Bonus Plans with respect to the Bonus Period.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.20_ shall be construed to limit the
right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing
Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan, Company Pension Plan, Company Other Plan or other employee benefit
plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of
the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this _Section 6.20_ be construed
to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following
the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of
any particular Company Employee for any fixed period of time following the
Closing Date.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of  _Section 9.9_, the
provisions of this _Section 6.20_ are solely for the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent
contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein

 



64  shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, Company
Pension Plan, Company Other Plan or other employee benefit plan for any
purpose.

 

(f) Prior to making any equity awards permitted under  _Section
5.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company shall amend Section 5.8
of the Company Stock Plan to provide that the accelerated vesting provisions
contained in such Section 5.8 shall not apply with respect to the Merger to
any equity awards made after the date of this Agreement.

matters presented in connection with this Agreement to the Company
Stockholders and Parent Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders or Parent Stockholders, no amendment of this Agreement shall be
made that by Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange
requires further approval by the Company Stockholders or the Parent
Stockholders, as the case may be, without obtaining such approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

or Parent Stockholders Approval, no extension or waiver of this Agreement or
any portion thereof shall be made that by Law requires further adoption and
approval by the Company Stockholders or Parent Stockholders, as the case may
be, without obtaining such approval. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No provision of this
Agreement requiring any party to use reasonable best efforts or to act in
good faith in any context shall be interpreted to require

 



72  a party, as part of such partys duty to use reasonable best efforts or to
act in good faith in the context in question, to waive any condition to the
obligations of such party hereunder or to refrain from exercising any right
or power such party may have hereunder.

execution and delivery of this Agreement.

9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Each
of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that
court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto
waives any defense or inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might
be required of any other party with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any
party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy
of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in _Section 9.3_. Nothing in this _Section
9.7_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, INCLUDING THE FINANCING, OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB

 



75  OR COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

9.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.9 _Assignment; Reliance of Other Parties_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law
or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties and any
attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub may assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to any other direct wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent. Except (i) as provided in _Section 6.7_ (Directors and
Officers Indemnification and Insurance) hereof and (ii) the provisions of
_Article II_  concerning payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, which
shall inure to the benefit of the Company Stockholders but, prior to the
Effective Time, may only be enforced by the Company acting on their behalf,
this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein)
is not intended to confer upon any Person other than (x) the parties hereto
and (y) with respect to the fourth and seventh sentences of _Section 9.7_ and
this clause (y), the Financing Sources.

9.10 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub, or any other

covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings pursuant to or otherwise
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As a material inducement to the
Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Merger Sub (or such assignee) of each of its
covenants, obligations and undertakings pursuant to or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees
that any breach of, or other failure to perform, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub (or
such assignee) shall also be deemed to be a breach or failure to perform by
Parent, and the Company or any Person authorized under _Section 9.9_, if
applicable, shall have the right, exercisable in the Company or such Persons
sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies the Company or such

 



76  Person may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly
against either or both of Parent and Merger Sub (or such assignee) in the
first instance.

 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that (i) irreparable injury, for which damages, even if available, will not be
an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or
are otherwise breached, and (ii) the parties will be, subject to the
limitations set forth herein, entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof. Accordingly, subject to the limitations set forth herein, (x) Parent
and Merger Sub shall be entitled to the issuance of temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction,
without the posting of any bond, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and compel performance of the Companys
obligations hereunder and (y) the Company shall be entitled to the issuance of
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction, without the posting of any bond, to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and compel
