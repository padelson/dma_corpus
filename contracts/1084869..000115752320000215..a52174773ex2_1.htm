1.5 Determination of Purchase Price.

five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Seller will furnish to the
Buyer a certificate  signed by an executive officer of the Company (the
"Estimated Purchase Price Certificate") setting forth (i) a good faith
estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital (the "Estimated     Net
Working Capital"); (ii) the Estimated Indebtedness and Paid Indebtedness;
(iii) the estimated Seller's Expenses, and associated wire instructions from

Company Cash  (the "Estimated Company Cash"); and (v) a reasonably detailed
calculation of each of the foregoing (i) through (iv) and the Purchase Price
using the foregoing estimates (the "Estimated     Purchase Price"). The
Estimated Purchase Price Certificate will be prepared using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications and estimation methodologies, as were used in the
preparation  of the Financial Statements (to the extent applicable and, in
all cases, subject to the definitions herein (which such definitions shall
control)), and will not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a
result of purchase accounting  adjustments arising from, or resulting as a
consequence of, the Transactions. The Estimated Purchase Price Certificate
shall be conclusive for purposes of determining the Estimated Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Indebtedness and Paid  Indebtedness, the estimated
Seller's Expenses, the Estimated Company Cash, and the Estimated Purchase
Price.

 


 

 

 

10  


 

 

(b) Initial Determination. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer will prepare in good faith and deliver to the Seller a certificate (the
"Purchase Price Certificate") executed by an executive officer of the Buyer
setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the Buyer's good faith calculations of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Seller's  Expenses and
Company Cash, and (ii) the Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price based
thereon. The Purchase Price Certificate will be prepared using the same
accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications  and estimation methodologies, as were used in the
preparation of the Financial Statements (to the extent applicable and, in all
cases, subject to the definitions herein (which such definitions shall
control)), and will not include any changes in  assets or liabilities as a
result of purchase accounting adjustments arising from, or resulting as a
consequence of the Transactions. If the Buyer does not deliver the Purchase
Price Certificate to the Seller within sixty (60) days after the Closing 
Date, the Purchase Price specified in the Estimated Purchase Price Certificate
will be presumed to be true and complete in all respects and will be final and
binding on the parties.

 

(c) Seller's Right to Dispute. If the Seller delivers written notice (the
"Disputed Items Notice") to the Buyer within sixty (60)  days after receipt
by the Seller of the Purchase Price Certificate stating that the Seller
objects to any items in the Purchase Price Certificate (the "Disputed Items"),
the Buyer and the Seller will attempt in  good faith to resolve and finally
determine and agree upon the Disputed Items as promptly as practicable. If
such Disputed Items are resolved after delivery of the Disputed Items Notice,
the Purchase Price Certificate, and calculations reflected  therein, with
such changes as are agreed in writing by the Buyer and the Seller, shall be
final and binding on the parties. Any amount, determination or calculation
contained in the Purchase Price Certificate and not disputed in a timely
Disputed  Items Notice will be presumed to be true and complete in all
respects and will be final and binding on the parties. If the Seller does not
deliver the Disputed Items Notice to the Buyer within sixty (60) days after
receipt by the Seller of the  Purchase Price Certificate, the Purchase Price
specified in the Purchase Price Certificate will be presumed to be true and
complete in all respects and will be final and binding on the parties.

 

(d) Arbitration of Disputes. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to agree
upon the Disputed Items within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Disputed
Items Notice,  then, within forty-five (45) days after the delivery of the
Disputed Items Notice, the Buyer and the Seller will jointly engage an
independent, nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to
each of them (the "Independent Accounting Firm") to resolve the Disputed
Items. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) address only the Disputed
Items set forth in the Disputed Items Notice, (ii) provide each of the Buyer
and the  Seller with the same opportunity to present their respective
positions and submit materials regarding their proposed amounts for the
Disputed Items to the Independent Accounting Firm, including if requested by
either the Buyer or the Seller, at least  one opportunity to advocate for
their respective positions in person before the Independent Accounting Firm,
(iii) base its determination for each of the Disputed Items solely on the
submissions of the parties and the relevant definitions contained  herein,
and (iv) use the same accounting methods, practices, policies and principles
(including classification and estimation methodologies) used by the Seller to
prepare the Financial Statements referenced in _Section_ 2.7 __ (to the 
extent applicable and, in all cases, subject to the definitions herein (which
such definitions shall control)). The Independent Accounting Firm may not
assign a value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by  either party or less than the lowest value for such item
claimed by either party, in each case as presented to the Independent
Accounting Firm, and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. There shall be  no ex parte communication
between the Independent Accounting Firm and any of the Buyer or the Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, except for ministerial
matters or other  non-substantive communications or in the event a party
declines, after reasonable notice, to participate in a communication involving
the Independent Accounting Firm and such Person. All communications to the
Independent Accounting Firm (including  documentation or other evidence
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm) by or on behalf of a party shall
be provided simultaneously by or on behalf of such party to the other party.
All communications by the Independent Accounting Firm  (including all
requests for information or questions by the Independent Accounting Firm) to a
party or its Representatives shall also be delivered simultaneously by the
Independent Accounting Firm to the other party and its designated 
Representatives. The Independent Accounting Firm shall deliver to the Buyer
and the Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event within thirty (30)
days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of
any Disputed Items  determined in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Absent manifest error, the determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall  be allocated between
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the disputes not awarded to each party bears
to the amount actually contested by such party, such that the prevailing 
party pays the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For
example, if the Seller claims that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000
greater than the amount determined by the Buyer and set forth in the Purchase
Price Certificate and if  the Independent Accounting Firm ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding to the Seller $300 of the $1,000 contested
adjustments, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the  Buyer and 70% (i.e.,
700 ÷ 1,000) to the Seller. All other fees and expenses incurred by the Buyer,
the Seller or the Company in connection with the preparation, review or
negotiation of the Purchase Price Certificate shall be borne by the party 
incurring such fees and expenses.

 


 

 

 

11  


 

 

(e) Payment. Within five (5) Business Days after the Purchase Price is finally
determined, either (i) the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller
an aggregate  amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Final Purchase Price
over the Estimated Purchase Price or (ii) the Seller shall pay or cause to be
paid to the Buyer an aggregate amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Estimated Purchase Price over the  Final Purchase Price, as applicable, in
each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, within three (3)
Business Days after the Purchase Price is finally determined.

 

(f) Access to Information. The Seller and its accountants, lawyers and other
Representatives will be given reasonable access at all reasonable times to
(and shall be allowed  to make copies of) the books and records of the Buyer
and the Company, to any personnel of, and work papers prepared by, the Buyer
and the Company, and to such historical financial information of the Company,
in each case to the extent related to the  preparation of the Purchase Price
Certificate or any dispute relating thereto, as the Seller or its
Representatives may reasonably request in connection with the determination of
the Final Purchase Price or any dispute relating thereto.

 


 

 

 

12  


 

 

(g) Sample Calculation. A sample Closing Net Working Capital calculation is
attached hereto as _Schedule 1.5(g)_ , which the  parties acknowledge and
agree is for illustrative purposes only.

 

(h) Tax Withholding. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Purchase Price or any other amounts payable to the Seller hereunder, any
amounts required to  be deducted and withheld under the Code or any
provisions of applicable U.S. state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. The Buyer
shall notify the Seller of any amounts it intends to withhold under this
_Section 1.5(h)_ with respect to any payment  payable to the Seller under
this Agreement at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
unless such withholding is on account of the failure of the Seller to provide
the form set forth in _Section 6.1(g)_. The Buyer shall timely  pay any
amounts deducted and withheld to the applicable Governmental Authority. Any
amounts so deducted and withheld and paid by the Buyer to the relevant
Governmental Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid  to the Seller.

case may be) or its legal counsel; it being understood that materials provided
pursuant to this Agreement may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements  and (z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.
Except to the extent included in the definition of Seller's Expenses
hereunder, the Buyer will be responsible for the payment of all filing fees
associated with the filings  contemplated by this _Section 5.4(a)(ii)_ and
any other costs and expenses associated therewith. In addition, if any action
or proceeding is instituted (or threatened) challenging the Transactions as
violating any Law or if any decree,  order, judgment or injunction is
entered, enforced or attempted to be entered or enforced by any Governmental
Authority that would make the Transactions illegal or otherwise delay or
prohibit the consummation of the Transactions, the Buyer and its  Affiliates
and the Seller and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
contest and defend any such action or proceeding to avoid entry of, or have
vacated, lifted, reversed, repealed, rescinded or terminated, any order that 
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

 

 


 

 

 

35  


 

 

(b) Until such date that the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to
the Transactions shall have expired or been terminated or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the  Buyer will
not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, enter into or consummate
any acquisition of any Person or business with at least 75% of its prior
financial year revenues derived from personalized gifts or similar products if
the intent  or reasonably anticipated consequence of such acquisition would
be to prohibit, impair or materially delay the parties from obtaining any
approval or consent required by this Agreement.

 

(c) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve any right
or benefit under any Contract to which the Company is a party is not obtained
prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, subsequent to the  Closing,
reasonably cooperate with the Buyer and the Company in attempting to obtain
such consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable.

 

5.5 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to, without further consideration, use 
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and
to do or cause to be done all things reasonably necessary, proper, advisable
and requested by a party hereto to evidence, effectuate and consummate the
Transactions,  including (a) contesting any actions relating to the
Transactions, and (b) executing and delivering any documents, certificates,
instruments or other papers that are reasonably necessary to consummate the
Transactions.

 

5.6 Restrictive Covenants.

 

(a) Non-Solicit. For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, the
Seller will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, (a) hire or  employ, or solicit the employment of, any of the
individuals listed on _Schedule 5.6(a)(i)_ (each, a "Non-Solicit Person") or
(b) induce or attempt to induce any  Non-Solicit Person to terminate such
Person's employment with the Company or the Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.6_ shall restrict or prohibit the Seller
or any of its Affiliates from: (i) soliciting employees  generally in public
advertisements, postings on internal or external websites or by engaging
search firms that are not instructed specifically to solicit any Non-Solicit
Person, or from hiring or employing any Non-Solicit Person that is not set
forth  on _Schedule 5.6(a)(ii)_ who responds to any such generalized search
or solicitation; or (ii) taking any action with respect to a Non-Solicit
Person whose employment with the Company has been terminated  by the Company
at least six (6) months prior to any such action, and the Seller shall not be
in breach of this _Section 5.6_ for hiring or employing, or taking any other
action with respect to, any Non-Solicit Person who has been terminated as 
provided under clause (ii).

 


 

 

 

36  


 

 

(b) Non-Compete. For a period of four (4) years following the Closing Date,
the Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or
controlled Affiliates to,  directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist
others in engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an
ownership interest in any Person that engages in the Restricted Business in
the Territory in any capacity, including as a  partner, shareholder, member
or principal; or (iii) intentionally interfere in any material respect with
the business relationships (whether formed prior to or after the date of this
Agreement) between the Company and customers or suppliers of the  Company;
provided, that the foregoing restrictions shall not restrict or prohibit the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from any of the following:

 

(i) acquiring (by asset purchase, stock  purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, the stock, business or assets of any
Person that at the time of such acquisition is engaged in, or owns any
interest in or controls, manages, or operates any Person that is  engaged in,
the Restricted Business and continuing to engage in the business thereof in a
manner and on a scale substantially consistent with the conduct of such
business immediately prior to the acquisition of such business, so long as (A)
the  annual gross revenues of such business or Person attributable to the
Restricted Business does not exceed 15% of the gross revenues of such business
or Person (based on the latest annual financial statements of such business or
Person) or (B) the  gross revenue of such business or Person derived from the
Restricted Business does not exceed $15 million, in each case, for the most
recent fiscal year of such business or Person (each, a "Non-Restricted
Business  Threshold"). If the Non-Restricted Business Threshold is exceeded,
then the Seller shall (or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to):

 


 

 

(x) within thirty (30) days following  the consummation of the acquisition,
offer to sell that portion of such business or Person that constitutes a
Restricted Business to the Buyer to the extent required to comply with this
_Section 5.6(b)(i)_ on economic terms similar to those  pursuant to which the
Seller acquired such business or Person (an "Offer Notice"), and, if the Buyer
delivers written notice to the Seller within thirty (30) days following
receipt of an Offer Notice (the "Offer Period") indicating its desire to
acquire such portion of the business or Person, the Buyer and the Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to enter into a definitive agreement on mutually
acceptable terms as  promptly as reasonably practicable, and

 


 

 

 

37  


 

 

 

 

(y) if the Buyer (1) delivers written notice to the Seller indicating that
it  does not desire to acquire such portion of the business or Person or (2)
does not deliver written notice to the Seller within the Offer Period
indicating its desire to acquire such portion of the business or Person, then,
within nine (9) months of  such date, cease such Restricted Business or
divest such business or Person of that portion of such business that
constitutes a Restricted Business, in each case, to the extent required to
comply with this _Section_ 5.6(b)(i);

 


 

 

(ii) the acquisition, holding of investments or direct or indirect ownership
of  any voting stock, capital stock or other equity interest of any Person
engaged in a Restricted Business, so long as such ownership interest
represents not more than three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power or
outstanding capital stock or  other equity interests of such Person; or

 


 

 

(iii) as set forth on _Schedule 5.6(b)_   hereto.

 


 

 

 

5.7 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer, the Company and the Seller shall
cooperate fully, to the extent reasonably requested by another party, in
connection with the  filing of Tax Returns, and any Tax Contest. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another party's request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
Tax Returns or Tax Contest, the execution  and delivery of powers of attorney
(as are necessary to carry out the intent of _Section 5.7(i)_ ), and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided  hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Seller
(or its Affiliates) nor the Buyer (or its Affiliates) shall be required at any
time to provide to the other party any right to access or to review any Tax 
Return or Tax work papers of the Seller or the Buyer (as the case may be) or
any Affiliate of the Seller or the Buyer (as the case may be) that are filed
or prepared on an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar basis
for federal,  state, local or foreign Tax purposes; provided that the Seller
or the Buyer (as the case may be) shall provide any information solely with
respect to the Company on a pro forma basis as reasonably requested  by the
other party in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or the conduct of
any Tax Contest.

 

(b) Tax Refunds. The Seller shall be entitled to any refund of any Taxes that
were previously indemnified by the Seller under _Section 5.7_ , plus any
interest actually  received with respect thereto from the applicable
Governmental Authority. Any Tax refund received by the Buyer or the Company to
which the Seller is entitled pursuant to the previous sentence, net of any
applicable Taxes and any reasonable costs  associated with obtaining such
refund, shall be paid in cash to the Seller within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Buyer or the Company.

 


 

 

 

38  


 

 

(c) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp and
registration Taxes imposed in respect of the transfer of the Interests
pursuant to this Agreement,  excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Income Taxes (such non-excluded taxes, "Transfer Taxes"), shall be paid 50% by
Seller and 50% by the Buyer when due, and the Company will file all necessary
Tax  Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and,
if required by applicable Law, the Buyer and the Seller will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. Other than this Agreement, all existing Tax
Sharing Agreements between the Company (on the one hand) and the Seller and/or
any Affiliate(s) of  Seller (on the other hand) shall be terminated on or
before the day prior to the Closing Date (as to the Company). After the day
prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its Affiliates shall have no
continuing liability or obligations under any  such agreement.

 

(e) Certain Tax Deductions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Buyer  hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Transaction Tax
Deductions shall be for the sole benefit of the Seller and hereby agrees,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, (i) to prepare and file, and to
cause its Affiliates to prepare and file,  all Tax Returns consistent with
the Seller's entitlement to the benefit of the Transaction Tax Deductions and
(ii) to not take, and to not permit its Affiliates to take, a position on any
Tax Return or in any Tax Contest inconsistent with the  Seller's entitlement
to the benefit of the Transaction Tax Deductions.

 

(f) Tax Treatment.

 

(i) The Seller and the Buyer agree that for U.S. federal and all applicable
state or local Income Tax purposes, the acquisition of the Interests by the
Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.2_ shall be treated  as a sale of the assets of
the Company by the Seller to the Buyer, and neither the Seller nor the Buyer
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent
therewith on any Income Tax Return, unless required by applicable Law.

 

(ii) The Seller and the Buyer intend, for U.S. federal and any other
applicable state and local Income Tax purposes, that with respect to any
prepaid revenue or prepaid income of the Company as of the Closing  Date, (x)
the Buyer shall not recognize any income and the Seller and the Buyer shall
treat the Buyer's costs of performance associated with such revenue or income
as additional purchase price for the acquisition of the Interests by the
Buyer  pursuant to _Section 1.2_ , as such costs of performance are incurred
(to be reported promptly to the Seller as such costs of performance are
incurred) and (y) the Seller shall claim a deduction in an aggregate amount
equal to such costs of  performance, to be taken as such costs of performance
are incurred. By way of example (and for illustration purposes only), if, as
of the Closing Date, the prepaid income of the Company is $1 million and in
2020 after the Closing Date the Company  incurs $800,000 of costs of
performance with respect to such prepaid income, the Buyer shall not recognize
any income in respect of such prepaid income, the Seller and the Buyer shall
treat the $800,000 as additional purchase price for the  acquisition of the
Interests by the Buyer and the Seller shall claim a deduction of $800,000 on
its Combined Tax Returns. Unless otherwise required by Law, none of the Buyer,
the Seller or any of their Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent 
with the first sentence of this _Section 5.7(f)(ii)_ on any Tax Return or for
any other Tax purpose.

 


 

 

 

39  


 

 

(g) Purchase Price Allocation. Within forty (40) days following the
determination of the Final Purchase Price under _Section 1.5_ , the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver  to the Seller a schedule allocating the Final
Purchase Price (and the relevant liabilities of the Company treated as
consideration for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes (the "Tax Liabilities"))
among the assets  of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision
of state, local and foreign Law, as appropriate) (the "Allocation").   The
Seller shall provide such information as the Buyer shall reasonably request
for preparation of the Allocation. The Seller shall have the right, for a
period of forty (40) days after such delivery (the "Review  Period"), to
review such draft Allocation. If the Seller notifies the Buyer that it objects
to the draft Allocation, by delivering to the Buyer a written notice of its
specific objections to the draft Allocation before the end of the Review 
Period (the "Objection Notice"), the Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in
good faith, for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the
parties shall mutually agree), the resolution of such  disputed items. It is
understood and agreed by the parties that if the Seller does not deliver the
Objection Notice to the Buyer before the end of the Review Period, it shall be
deemed to have agreed to the draft Allocation. If the Seller has  agreed in
writing to the Buyer's draft Allocation originally delivered to the Seller (or
is deemed to have agreed to such Allocation under this _Section 5.7(g)_ ), or
if the Seller has timely delivered the Objection Notice to the Buyer but the 
parties have resolved all of the disputed items with the Seller and the Buyer
each having agreed in writing to the final Allocation, then, except in
connection with any contest or settlement described in the last sentence of
this _Section 5.7(g)_ ,  the Seller and the Buyer shall file, and each party
shall cause its respective Affiliates to file, all Income Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the final Allocation. If
the Seller and the Buyer do not agree on the  Allocation (and are not deemed
to have agreed to the initial Allocation under this _Section 5.7(g)_ ), then
each party shall file, and shall permit its Affiliates to file, all Income Tax
Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in any manner that it  chooses regarding
the allocation of the Final Purchase Price and the Tax Liabilities. If the
parties have agreed to the Allocation and any Governmental Authority disputes
the Allocation, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly
notify  the other party hereto; provided, however, either party shall be
entitled (in its complete discretion) to contest or to settle any Allocation
issue with any  Governmental Authority.

 

(h) Tax    Indemnity.

 


 

 

(i) The Seller shall indemnify, defend  and hold harmless each Buyer
Indemnified Party from and against, without duplication, any Losses incurred
by such Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to (A) any Taxes for which the
Company is liable (1) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,  (2) as a
result of being a member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar group at any time prior to the Closing, (3) as a transferee, successor
or otherwise by operation of Law as a result of a merger, reorganization or
other  transaction occurring at any time prior to the Closing (including any
Taxes of Predecessor), or (4) pursuant to any Contract entered into prior to
the Closing (other than (I) a Commercial Tax Agreement or (II) a Contract
entered into by the Buyer or  any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company)
with respect to which neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including
the Company) is a party), (B) any Transfer Taxes allocable to the Seller
pursuant to _Section 5.7(c)_ and (C) any breach  of any representation or
warranty set forth in _Section 2.16_ (which representations and warranties
shall be read, for purposes of determining whether a breach occurred and the
amount of any Losses resulting therefrom (1) without any  qualification as to
"materiality", "Company Material Adverse Effect", or words of similar import
contained in any such representation or warranty and (2) as if such
representations and warranties were made as of the Closing Date); provided
that any  Losses indemnifiable under this clause (C) shall be limited to
Losses in respect of Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods except in
the case of any breach of any representation or warranty in _Section
2.16(a)(iv)(C)_ , _Section  2.16(c)_ , _Section 2.16(d)(i)_ or _(ii)_ ,
_Section 2.16(e)_ , _Section 2.16(i)_ or _Section 2.16(j)_ , excluding, in
each case, any Losses with respect to any Buyer Closing Date Taxes (the
amounts specified in clauses  (A)-(C), other than any Buyer Closing Date
Taxes, "Indemnified Tax Losses").

 

 


 

 

 

40  

 

 


 

 

(ii) The amount and timing of Seller's indemnification obligations under this
_Section    5.7(h)_ shall be subject to the following: (A) the Seller shall
not be required to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party for the amount of any
Taxes subject to indemnification under _Section 5.7(h)(i)_ until there has
been a Final  Determination in respect of the matter giving rise to the
indemnification claim at issue; provided that nothing in this clause (A) shall
limit or delay (x) any payment obligation of Seller under _Section  5.7(c)_
or _Section 5.7(k)_ , (y) any obligation of Seller to indemnify a Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses other than Taxes indemnifiable
under _Section 5.7(h)(i)_ , including expenses of contesting a matter giving 
rise to an indemnification claim (whether or not successful) or (z) any
obligation of the Seller to make payment in respect of Taxes (or to make a
deposit or post collateral in respect of Taxes) before a Final Determination
because such prepayment,  deposit or collateral is required as a condition to
challenging the matter giving rise to the indemnification claim at issue; (B)
the Buyer shall provide the Seller with reasonable support (in appropriate
detail as reasonably requested by the  Seller) for the indemnification
payment sought by the Buyer Indemnified Party; (C) the indemnity obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.7(h)_ shall survive until ninety (90) days
following the expiration of the statute of limitations  applicable to the
underlying claim and collection thereof (the "Indemnification Claims Period");
provided that, in the event a claim has been asserted in writing by  Buyer on
or prior to the expiration of the applicable Indemnification Claims Period,
and such claim is unresolved as of the expiration of the Indemnification
Claims Period, then the right to indemnification with respect to such claim
shall remain  in effect until such matter has been finally determined; and
(D) the amount payable by the Seller pursuant to this _Section 5.7(h)_ shall
be determined net of any proceeds under the RandW Policy that are actually
recovered by the Buyer and  its Affiliates in connection with the facts
giving rise to any such right of indemnification hereunder and the Buyer shall
in good faith first seek recovery under the RandW Policy to the extent available
under the terms and provisions of the  RandW Policy with respect to any Losses
that otherwise would be payable by the Seller under this _Section 5.7(h)_. All
indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated by the parties and 
their Affiliates as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 


 

 

 

41  

 

 


 

 

(iii) The Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Seller
and  its Affiliates from and against, without duplication, any Losses
incurred by the Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to (A) any
Transfer Taxes allocable to the Buyer pursuant to _Section 5.7(c)_ , and (B)
any Buyer Closing Date Taxes.

 


 

 

 

(i) Control of Tax Contests.

 

 

(i) Except for any Tax Contest covered under _Section 5.7(i)(ii)_ relating 
to 2016 Tax Periods or any Tax Contest relating to any Straddle Period Tax
Return covered under _Section 5.7(i)(iv)_ , if notice of any Tax Contest
relating to the Company that might give rise to a claim for indemnity pursuant
to _Section  5.7(h)_ is received by Seller or Buyer (or any of their
Affiliates), the party that receives such notice shall notify the other party
in writing of such Tax Contest within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof;
provided, that the failure of the Buyer to deliver any required notice shall
not relieve the Seller of any of its obligations under this _Section 5.7_
except to the extent the Seller is actually and materially prejudiced by 
such failure. With respect to any such Tax Contest, if the Seller notifies the
Buyer that it wishes to assume control of the Tax Contest within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of the notice of such Tax Contest, the Seller shall be
entitled to control  the conduct of such Tax Contest at Seller's expense;
provided, however, that with respect to any Tax Contest covered under this
_Section 5.7(i)(i)_ , (A) the  Buyer shall have the right to participate in
such Tax Contest at its own expense, (B) Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed with respect to such Tax Contest, shall consult with Buyer in advance
of making any material written submissions in  respect of such Tax Contest
and shall promptly provide Buyer with copies of any material correspondence
with respect to such Tax Contest and (C) the Seller shall not settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest without the  prior
written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a
Tax Contest with respect to any Combined Tax Return, the Seller shall have the
sole right to  participate in, control and resolve such Tax Contest.

 


 

 

(ii) If notice of any Tax Contest relating to the Company (including
Predecessor)  for any 2016 Tax Period that might give rise to an indemnity
claim under _Section 5.7(h)_ is received by the Seller or Buyer (or any of
their Affiliates), the party that receives such notice shall notify the other
party in writing of such Tax  Contest within fifteen (15) days after receipt
thereof; provided, that the failure of Buyer to deliver any required notice
shall not relieve the Seller of any of its obligations under this _Section
5.7_   except to the extent the Seller is actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure. With respect to any such Tax Contest, the Seller shall (at
Seller's expense) have the right to control, and/or to designate a Person
familiar with the tax issues  of the Company (including Predecessor) relating
to the 2016 Tax Period (the "Designated Tax Person") to control, the conduct
and resolution of such Tax Contest; provided,  however, that, subject to the
last sentence of this _Section 5.7(i)(ii)_ , (A) Seller shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed with respect to such Tax Contest,  shall consult with
Buyer in advance of making any written material submissions in respect of such
Tax Contest and shall promptly provide Buyer with copies of any material
correspondence with respect to such Tax Contest and (B) the Seller (or the 
Designated Tax Person, as applicable) shall not settle, compromise and/or
concede any portion of such Tax Contest that would affect the Buyer, without
the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, if with respect to any Tax Contest described in this _Section
5.7(i)(ii)_ : (A) the 2016 Seller has the right to control such Tax Contest
pursuant to the 2016 Acquisition  Agreement and chooses to do so and (B) the
2016 Acquisition Agreement limits the Seller's rights to notice or the receipt
of information with respect to, or the Seller's right to consent or withhold
consent to any settlement of, such Tax Contest,  Buyer's rights under the
preceding sentence with respect to such Tax Contest shall be correspondingly
limited for so long as (and to the extent that) the Seller's rights remain so
limited.

 


 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 


 

 

(iii) Except with respect to any Tax relating to any Straddle Period Tax
Return  covered under _Section 5.7(i)(iv)_ , if (x) the Seller shall decline
to assume control of the conduct of a Tax Contest described in _Section
5.7(i)(i)_ or (y) the Seller and the Designated Tax Person each shall decline
to assume control  of the conduct of a Tax Contest described in _Section
5.7(i)(ii)_ , then, in each case, the Buyer may (at Seller's expense) assume
the control of the conduct of such Tax Contest; provided that (A) the  Seller
(and/or the Designated Tax Person, as applicable) shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Contest at its (or their) own expense and (B) the
Buyer shall not settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Contest without the
prior written  consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 


 

 

(iv) If any notice of any Tax Contest in respect of any Straddle Period that
might  give rise to an indemnity claim under _Section 5.7(h)_ is received by
Seller or Buyer (or any of their Affiliates), the party that receives such
notice shall notify the other party in writing of such Tax Contest within
fifteen (15) days after  receipt thereof; provided, that the failure of the
Buyer to deliver any required notice shall not relieve the Seller of any of
its obligations under this _Section 5.7_ except to the extent the Seller  is
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The Seller and the Buyer
shall have joint control over any such Tax Contest at their own expense;
provided, however, that, (A) each party shall keep the other party reasonably
informed with respect to such Tax Contest, shall consult with the other party
in advance of making any written submissions in respect of such Tax Contest
and  shall promptly provide the other party with copies of any material
correspondence with respect to such Tax Contest and (B) neither party shall
settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest without the
prior written consent of  the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 


 

 

 

43  


 

 

(v) Any Tax Contest that is outstanding at the time of the Closing shall be 
governed by the provisions set forth in the applicable paragraph in this
_Section 5.7(i)_ (as if the Buyer had notified the Seller of such Tax
Contest).

 


 

 

 

(j) Certain Other Tax Covenants Relating to the  2016 Tax Periods. Without
the prior written consent of the Seller (which may be withheld, conditioned or
delayed in the Seller's sole and absolute discretion), the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not, and the Buyer shall not permit any of  Buyer's
Affiliates to, (A) file any amended Tax Returns of the Company (including
Predecessor) for any 2016 Tax Period, unless required by applicable Law, (B)
extend or waive the applicable statute of limitations with respect to Taxes of
the Company  (including Predecessor) for any 2016 Tax Period, (C) file any
Tax Returns of the Company (including Predecessor) for any 2016 Tax Period or
any ruling request with a Governmental Authority that relates to Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company  (including Predecessor) for any 2016 Tax Period or
(D) (i) initiate any voluntary disclosure agreement with any Governmental
Authority with respect to any 2016 Tax Period or (ii) initiate any other
disclosure to or discussion with any Governmental  Authority with respect to
any 2016 Tax Period, which disclosure or discussion reasonably could be
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the Seller's
indemnification obligations under _Section 5.7(h)_ in respect of such 2016
Tax  Period.

 

(k) Certain Tax Returns.

 

(i) _Income Tax Return_ _s_.    The Seller and its Affiliates (other than
the Company) shall include in their applicable Income Tax Returns, all items
of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Company through and
including the Closing Date (including with respect to the  Sale of the
Interests) and shall pay all Income Taxes related thereto.

 

(ii) _Non-Income Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall cause the  Company to prepare
and file with the applicable Governmental Authority all Non-Income Tax Returns
of the Company for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due after the Closing Date
and shall pay any Non-Income Taxes shown as due on such originally filed 
Non-Income Tax Return. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Company, unless required by Law, or
as specifically contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller a copy of any  such Tax Return filed with an applicable Governmental
Authority promptly after filing such Tax Return. If, after all originally
filed Non-Income Tax Returns (including payroll Tax Returns) of the Company
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due  after the Closing Date have been
filed, the aggregate net amount of Non-Income Taxes (including payroll Taxes)
included as a liability in the computation of the final Closing Net Working
Capital exceeds the aggregate net amount of Non-Income Taxes  (including
payroll Taxes), other than any payroll Taxes borne by the Seller as Seller's
Expenses, that are paid after the Closing with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax
Periods included in such originally filed Tax Returns, the Buyer shall pay
such  excess amount in cash to the Seller within fifteen (15) days after the
last such Tax Return is filed (or, if later, after the final Closing Net
Working Capital has been determined). If, after all originally filed Non-
Income Tax Returns (including  payroll Tax Returns) of the Company for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods that are due after the Closing Date have been filed, the
aggregate net amount of Non-Income Taxes (including payroll Taxes) included as
a liability in the computation of the final  Closing Net Working Capital is
less than the aggregate net amount of Non-Income Taxes (including payroll
Taxes), other than any payroll Taxes borne by the Seller as Seller's Expenses,
that are paid after the Closing with respect to the Pre-Closing  Tax Periods
included in such originally filed Tax Returns, the Seller shall pay the
deficiency in cash to the Buyer within fifteen (15) days after the last such
Tax Return is filed (or, if later, after the final Closing Net Working Capital
has been  determined).

  
 

 

44  

 


 

 

(iii) Except to the extent provided in  _Section 5.7(j)_ with respect to any
2016 Tax Periods, or as otherwise required by Law, the Buyer and the Company

officer, manager, member,  trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or

sixty (60) days prior to such proposed destruction or disposition to surrender
them to the Seller, and (ii) afford the Seller and its accountants, lawyers
and other  Representatives at all reasonable times to have access to and to

Indemnified Party shall suffer, incur or that shall be imposed upon such Buyer
Indemnified Party, based upon, arising out of or resulting from the matters
set forth on _Schedule 7.2(a)_ (the "Specified Matters"). Any payments by
Seller pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall be net of any  amounts the Buyer
Indemnified Parties actually recover from any insurance policies maintained by
the Company in effect immediately prior to Closing and applicable to such
Specified Losses, net of expenses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
in  obtaining such recovery and any increases in premiums under any such
insurance policies to any Buyer Indemnified Parties as a result of such claim.
The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no obligation to continue any such
insurance coverage or to  first submit or to collect upon any applicable
insurance coverage as a precondition to making a claim for indemnification
hereunder or obtaining indemnification for covered Specified Losses therefor.
Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that such  amounts are received by a
Buyer Indemnified Party after payment has been made by the Seller to such
Buyer Indemnified Party, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over
to the Seller the aggregate amount by which the sum of (A) the amount of 
such previous indemnification payment(s) regarding such Specified Losses, plus
(B) the amount of such insurance recovery, exceeds all of the Specified
Losses. The Buyer Indemnified Parties will take commercially reasonable steps
to mitigate, to the  extent required by Law, any of the Specified Losses for
which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek indemnification hereunder.
Any failure to mitigate any of the Specified Losses shall not preclude the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from seeking  indemnification hereunder; provided,
that, such indemnification may be reduced by the extent of such failure to
mitigate, to the extent such failure prejudices the Seller. All
indemnification payments made  under this _Section 7.2_ shall be treated by
the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

(b) The Seller (and/or a Person designated by the Seller familiar with the
Specified Matters (the "Designated Specified Matters Person")), shall have the
right to assume the  defense of, continue to defend against, and pursue
affirmative claims and counterclaims of, the Specified Matters, at its sole
cost and expense and by its (and/or the Designated Specified Matters Person's)
own counsel. The Seller shall provide prompt  written notice to the Buyer as
to any Person it designates as a Designated Specified Matters Person following
the date of this Agreement. The Buyer shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense or counterclaims at the sole cost and expense of the  Seller or the
Designated Specified Matters Person. The Seller shall be obligated to pay any
amounts ultimately owed to the counterparty in the Specified Matters and shall
be entitled to receive any payments ultimately recovered from the
counterparty  in the Specified Matters. To the extent any payments are
recovered from the counterparty by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, the
Seller shall have the right to recover such payments from the Buyer. The
Seller shall not, and shall not cause or  allow the Designated Specified
Matters Person to, file or serve any document in the name of any Buyer
Indemnified Party prior to (a) providing a copy of such proposed document to
the Buyer, and (b) obtaining the Buyer's consent to the filing or  service of
such document, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Seller shall not either enter into any settlement or consent to the
Designated Specified Matters Person entering into any settlement of any
Specified Matter  without the prior written consent of the Buyer, unless the
proposed settlement involves only the Seller's, the Designated Specified
Matters Person's or the counterparty's payment of money damages and does not
impose an injunction or other equitable  relief on any Buyer Indemnified
Party and the terms of such settlement provide for a complete, unconditional
release of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any liability arising out of such
Specified Matter. The Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the  right to
participate in the defense of any Specified Matter with counsel selected by it
subject to the Seller's or the Designated Specified Matters Person's right to
control the defense thereof, and the fees and disbursements of such counsel
shall be  at the expense of the Buyer Indemnified Party.

 


 

 

 

55  


 

 

(c) (i) The Seller shall not be permitted to make any public statements or
take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the interest of any Buyer Indemnified Party in  relation to the
Specified Matters and (ii) the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce any contractual rights it may have to prevent any
Designated Specified Matters Person from taking any action prohibited by
clause (i).

 

(d) If the Seller and the Designated Specified Matters Person each shall
decline to assume control of the defense of or continue to defend against any
Specified Matter, then the Buyer may assume the control of the  defense of
such Specified Matter, and any amounts incurred by Buyer in connection with or
related to such defense shall for the avoidance of doubt be Specified Losses
hereunder, provided that (x) the Seller  and the Designated Specified Matters
Person shall have the right to participate in such Specified Matter, at its
own expense and (y) the Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of any
Specified Matter, without the prior written consent of the  Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If any of
the Seller or the Designated Specified Matters Person decline to assume
control of the defense or fail to continue to defend against any Specified
Matter,  they shall provide advance written notice to the Buyer.

 

(e) Upon any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party for Specified Losses, the
Seller shall pay such amounts by wire transfer of  immediately available
funds within ten (10) Business Days of the resolution of such claim as
mutually agreed by such Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller or the entering of
a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be required
to make any payment under this _Section 7.2(e)_ until the date that is two (2)
Business Days following written notice by such Buyer Indemnified Party
designating the  account to which such payment should be made.

56  


 

 

(c) by the Seller (if it is not then in breach of its representations,

failure of the  Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement)
and the Seller has not waived such breach, failure or misrepresentation on or
before the Closing Date;

 

(d) by either the Seller or the Buyer, if (i) any court of competent
jurisdiction or applicable Governmental Authority has issued a final and non-
appealable Order, decree or ruling permanently restraining,  enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, or (ii) there
shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Transactions illegal or
otherwise prohibited; provided, that the right to  terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach
of this Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the issuance
of such Order or the enactment of such Law;

 

(e) by either the Seller or the Buyer, if the Closing has not occurred by June
15, 2020 (the "Outside Date") or such other date, if any, as the Seller and
the Buyer may agree in writing; provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section _8.1(e) shall not be  available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
principle cause of or resulted in the failure of the Transactions to occur on
or before such date; or

 

(f) by the Seller, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ 6.1
have been satisfied or waived in writing (other than conditions that by their
terms  are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing), (ii) the Buyer has failed to consummate the Closing

pursuant to this _Section_ 8.1(f) if the Buyer fails to consummate the Closing

consummate the Closing within such three (3) Business Day period.

 

8.2 Effect of Termination. Except in the case of termination under _Section_
8.1(a), written notice of termination of this Agreement shall be  given by
the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, to the other party, specifying
the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor. In the event of valid termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section _ 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no
further force and effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of any party or any of their respective stockholders, Representatives or
Affiliates with respect to  this Agreement or the Transactions, and all
rights of each party shall cease, except (i) for the agreements contained in
(A) this _Section_ 8.2, (B) the penultimate sentence of _Section 5.1(b)_ , as
well as the Confidentiality Agreement,  and (C) Article IX, which shall each

9.2 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or
supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each party hereto. No 
waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof will be effective unless
explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver
by any party will operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any
failure, breach or  default not expressly identified by such written waiver,
whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or
after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right,
remedy, power or privilege arising  from this Agreement will operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,  remedy, power or
privilege.

 

9.3 Choice of Law; Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or the Transactions shall be  governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to conflicts of laws principles that would cause the application of the laws
of another jurisdiction.

 

(b) Any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be brought only in the federal or state courts located in
the State of Delaware. This provision may be filed with any court  as written
evidence of the knowing and voluntary irrevocable agreement between the
parties to waive any objections to jurisdiction, to venue or to convenience of
forum.

 

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY 
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

9.4 Specific Performance. The provisions of this Agreement are uniquely
related to the desire of the parties and their respective Affiliates to 
consummate the Transactions, and such Transactions represent a unique business
opportunity at a unique time for each of the parties and their respective
Affiliates. As a result, the parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable
damage would occur  if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its terms. The parties further acknowledge and agree that,
although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants
and undertakings, monetary damages would  be difficult to ascertain and an
inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, each party agrees, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, that if the Seller, on the one hand, or the Buyer
or the Parent, on the other hand, breaches or threatens to breach  any
provision of this Agreement, the Seller, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and any and all other equitable relief to prevent or restrain
breaches or  threatened breaches of this Agreement. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or seeking to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide, furnish or  post any bond or other security in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such Order or injunction.
Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the provision,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.   If any action or
proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement: (a) no party shall allege, and each party waives the defense, that
there is an adequate remedy at Law; and (b) each party waives all other
defenses  to enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement other
than defenses to the existence of any breach hereof. The rights in this
_Section 9.4_ are in addition to any other remedy to which a party may be
entitled at Law or in equity,  and the exercise by a party of one remedy
shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of a party to seek specific
performance or other equitable remedies, in each case,  in order to cause the
Closing to occur, shall be subject to the requirements that all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VI_ were satisfied (other than
those conditions that have been waived or that by their terms are to be 
satisfied by actions taken at Closing) at the time when the Closing would have
been required to occur but for the breach alleged by the non-breaching party.
To the extent any party brings any Proceeding to enforce specifically the
performance of the  terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than a
Proceeding to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement) when available to such party pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall  automatically be extended to
(i) the 20th Business Day following the resolution of such Proceeding, if
later than the date the Outside Date would otherwise occur pursuant to the
terms hereof, or (ii) such other time period established by the court 
presiding over such Proceeding.

 

9.5 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, successors 
and permitted assigns. No party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided, that,
subject to the following sentence, prior to the Closing  Date, the Buyer may,
without the prior written consent of the Seller, assign all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates, as long as
the Buyer provides prior written notice to the Seller of such assignment.  
No assignment will relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

 


 

 

 

60  


 

 

9.6 Integration; Schedules.

 

(a) This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto,
and the Transaction Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties with respect to the Transactions and  supersedes all prior
discussions, understandings, statements, communications, representations,
warranties and agreements concerning the matters covered hereby, except as set
forth in _Section_ 5.1(b). The parties have voluntarily agreed to  define
their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the Transactions
exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or
are entitled to  any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents. Except in the case of Fraud, none of the parties
shall have any remedies or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) for any statements,  communications, disclosures, failure to
disclose, representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) Information set forth on any Schedule hereto shall be deemed to qualify
each Section of this Agreement to which such information is applicable
(regardless of whether or not such Section is qualified by  reference to a
Schedule), so long as application to such Section is reasonably apparent from
the face of such disclosure. No information set forth on any Schedule hereto
shall be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of the representations and 
warranties contained in this Agreement. The inclusion of an item on any
Schedule hereto is not evidence of the materiality of such item for purposes
of this Agreement or otherwise, or that such item is a disclosure required
under the Agreement. Any  description of any agreement, document, instrument,
plan, arrangement or other item set forth on any Schedule hereto is a summary
only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of such agreement,
document, instrument, plan, arrangement or item,  copies of which have been
made available to the Buyer. No disclosure in any Schedule hereto relating to
any possible breach or violation of any agreement, Authorization or Law shall
be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or  violation
exists or has actually occurred, or shall constitute an admission of liability
to any third party.

 

9.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
and with counterpart signature pages, each of which shall be an original, 
but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement, binding
on all of the parties hereto notwithstanding that all such parties have not
signed the same counterpart. Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement
transmitted by  electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document  bearing an original signature.

 

9.8 Expenses. All legal and other costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party 
incurring such costs and expenses, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein.

 


 

 

 

61  


 

 

9.9 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Persons listed in _Section 5.8_ are
intended third-party beneficiaries of the covenants and agreements in
_Section  5.8_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement will be construed as giving any third party any
right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision
hereof.

 

9.10 Publicity. No party shall issue a press release or make any other public
announcement concerning the Transactions without the prior written consent of
the Seller  and the Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except to the extent required by applicable Law (including
applicable stock exchange rules and regulations), in which case, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law and  practicable, the other parties hereto
shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment prior to disclosure;
provided, however, that no party shall be  required to obtain the approval of
any other party pursuant to this _Section 9.10_ if all of the information
about this Agreement or the Transactions that is contained in any proposed
release or announcement has previously been made public  without any breach
of this _Section 9.10_ by the party proposing to issue such release or
announcement and the other parties are provided with prior notice of such
disclosure.

 


 

 

9.11 Construction of Agreement.

 

(a) Severability. If any provision of this  Agreement is unenforceable or
illegal, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
law and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely 
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

(b) No Strict Construction. The parties  hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and
documents contemplated herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises under any provision of this  Agreement or any other
agreement or documents contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other
agreements or documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or  disfavoring any party by virtue of authoring any of the provisions of
this Agreement or any other agreements or documents contemplated herein.

 

(c) Headings. The headings of Articles and Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or
interpretation hereof.

 

(d) Currency. Unless otherwise specified herein, any references to "dollars,"
"$" or other dollar amounts in this Agreement means the lawful currency of the
United States.

 

(e) Business Days. Any reference to a "Business Day" is a reference to any day
except Saturday, Sunday, any statutory holiday in the State of Delaware or any
other day on  which chartered banks in the State of Delaware are closed for
business.

 


 

 

 

62  


 

 

(f) Calculation of Days. When calculating  the period of time within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business  Day, the
period in question shall end on the next Business Day.

 

(g) Knowledge. Any reference to "to the  Knowledge of the Company" or any
other similar phrase means the actual knowledge (after reasonable inquiry) of
the individuals listed on _Schedule 9.11(g)_.

 

(h) Pronouns. All words and personal  pronouns shall be read and construed as
the number and gender of the party or parties referred to in each case require
and the verb shall be construed as agreeing with the required word and
pronoun.

 

(i) Singular/Plural. Unless the context  otherwise requires, words denoting
the singular shall include the plural and words denoting the plural shall
include the singular.

 

(j) Laws and Documents. Unless otherwise  specified, (i) any references
herein to any Law shall be construed as a reference thereto as in effect from
time to time, and (ii) any reference to this Agreement or any other document
is a reference to this Agreement or such other document as  amended, restated
and supplemented from time to time and includes all schedules and exhibits
thereto; provided, that, with respect to items set forth on the Schedules,
such amendments, restatements,  supplements, schedules and exhibits have been
made available to the Buyer or the Parent.

 

(k) References to this Agreement. The  words "hereof," "herein," "hereto,"
"hereunder," "hereby" and other similar expressions refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular section or portion of it.

 

(l) Including. Where the word "including"  or the word "includes" is used in
this Agreement, it means "including (or includes) without limitation."

 

(m) Made Available. The term "made  available" means, with respect to any
document or information, that the same has been made available to the Buyer or
the Parent by means of the virtual data room entitled "Project Pacific"
maintained on behalf of the Seller by SecureDocs Inc. at  least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

9.12 Waiver of Conflicts.

 

Each of the Buyer and the Parent (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates)
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Seller and/or its
Affiliates shall have the  right to retain Proskauer Rose LLP (the
"Designated Firm") to represent its or their interests in any dispute arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, any Transaction Document, or the
transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby (a "Dispute"); (b) each of the
Buyer and the Parent (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) irrevocably
waives, consents to and covenants not to assert any objection, based on 
conflict of interest or otherwise, to any representation of the Seller or any
Affiliate by the Designated Firm in any Dispute; (c) all communications solely
between the Seller, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors, managers,  officers, employees and/or Representatives, on the one
hand, and the Designated Firm, on the other hand, to the extent made in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing
under, or any dispute arising in connection  with, this Agreement or
otherwise relating to any potential sale of the Company (the "Protected Seller
Communications"), shall be deemed to be privileged and confidential
communications; (d) all rights to such  Protected Seller Communications, and
the control of the confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto, shall be
retained by the Seller; and (e) to the extent the Buyer, the Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates (including the Company)  should discover in their
possession after the Closing any Protected Seller Communications, such party
shall take reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality thereof and
promptly deliver the same to the Seller, at the Seller's sole cost and 
expense, keeping no copies, and shall not by reason thereof assert any loss of
confidentiality or privilege protection.

 


 

 

 

63  

 

9.13 No Right of Set-Off. Except as expressly set forth herein, each of the
Buyer and the Parent, for itself  and its successors and permitted assigns,
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of set-off, netting,
offset, recoupment, or similar rights that the Buyer, the Parent or any of
their  respective successors and permitted assigns has or may have with
respect to the payment of the Purchase Price or any other payments to be made
by the Buyer or the Parent pursuant to this Agreement or any  other document
or instrument delivered by the Buyer or the Parent in connection herewith.

 

9.14 Parent Guaranty.

 

(a) The Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
to the Seller the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge of the
Buyer's obligations under this Agreement and each of the  other Transaction
Documents, to the same extent and on the same terms and conditions and subject
to the same defenses as applicable to such obligations by the Buyer (the
"Guaranteed Obligations").

 

 

(i) If the Buyer fails to discharge its Guaranteed Obligations when due
(whether  or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the
accrual or collection of any such Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a
discharge thereof) for any reason or no reason, the Seller may at any time and
from time to time, at the  Seller's option, and so long as the Buyer has
failed to perform any of its Guaranteed Obligations, take any and all actions
available hereunder or under Law to enforce the Parent's obligations hereunder
in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations.

 


 

 

(ii) In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parent acknowledges that the Seller
may,  in its sole and absolute discretion, bring and prosecute a separate
Proceeding against the Parent for the full amount of the Guaranteed
Obligations, regardless of whether a Proceeding is brought against the Buyer
or whether the Buyer is joined in  any such Proceeding. The Parent
acknowledges and agrees that in addition to any rights of the Seller set forth
in this _Section 9.14_ , with respect to the Buyer, the Seller shall have the
rights and remedies specified in this Agreement.

 


 

 

(iii) The Parent's liability with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations is 
absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective of (A) any
modification, amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this
Agreement or any assignment by the Buyer of all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement  in accordance with _Section 9.5_ , (B) the absence of
any Proceeding to enforce the Guaranteed Obligations, (C) the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Buyer, (D) the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding of  the Buyer, or (E) any other
circumstance that may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of a surety or guarantor. The Parent hereby waives promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filings of claims with any  court,
any right to require a proceeding first against the Buyer, protest or notice
with respect to the applicable Guaranteed Obligations and all demands
whatsoever, and covenants that the Parent's obligations hereunder will not be
discharged  except by complete performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. In
the event that any payment under this _Section 9.14_ is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned for any reason (other than in each case to the same
extent and on the same terms  and conditions and subject to the same defenses
as applicable to such obligations by the Buyer), the Parent shall remain
liable hereunder as if such payment had not been made. This guarantee is an
unconditional and continuing guarantee of payment  and performance when due
and not merely of collection. This guarantee may not be revoked or terminated
and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Parent
and its respective successors and assigns until all amounts payable  and
other obligations by the Parent under this guarantee with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations have been fully performed or indefeasibly paid in full.

(b) The Parent hereby represents and warrants that:

 

 

(i) The Parent is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing  under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all requisite
corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now conducted.

 


 

 

(ii) The Parent has all  necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver and to carry out the terms of this Agreement. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Parent of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions have been duly and  validly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part and no other proceedings on its part are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

(iii) This Agreement has  been duly executed and delivered by the Parent and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Parent, enforceable
in accordance with its terms, except as  limited by the Remedies Exception.

 


 

 

(iv) The Parent is not subject to or obligated under any Law, Contract or
Order,  which would be breached or violated or under which there would be a
conflict or default, as a result of the Parent's execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, except
any such breach, violation,  conflict or default that would not or would not
reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially impact the Parent's
ability to comply with its obligations hereunder.
