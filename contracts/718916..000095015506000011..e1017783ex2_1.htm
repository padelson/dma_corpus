virtue of the Merger and without any action  on the part of  the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any holders of shares of capital  stock of the 
Company or Merger Sub:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

**BACK**

 

 


 

 

(a) _Common  Stock of Merger Sub_.  Each  share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of Merger Sub  issued and  outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted  into and  become one (1) validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share  of common  stock, par value
$1.00 **** per  share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Certain Shares_.  All  Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time  and owned by any of
Parent, Merger Sub and any other Subsidiary  of Parent, and  all Shares held
in the treasury of the Company or owned by any  Company  Subsidiary, shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall  cease to exist  and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) _Conversion  of Shares_.  Each  Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other than  Shares to be canceled
and retired in accordance with Section 3.1(b)  and any  Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive  $45.50 in cash,  payable to
the holder thereof, without any interest thereon (the " _Merger 
Consideration_ "),  less  any required withholding taxes, upon surrender and
exchange of  a Certificate (as  defined below). All such Shares when so
converted, shall no longer  be  outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and  shall cease to  exist, and each holder of a
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")  that  immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such outstanding  Share  (other than any Dissenting
Share) shall cease to have any rights  with respect  thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor  upon the  surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.2.

 

 

Section  3.2. _Exchange  of Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company  (the " _Paying  Agent_ ")  reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as paying agent for  the holders of  Shares in
connection with the Merger, pursuant to an agreement  providing for the 
matters set forth in this Section 3.2 and such other matters as  may be 
appropriate and the terms of which shall be reasonably satisfactory  to the 
Company and Parent. Prior to or concurrent with the Effective Time,  Parent
shall  deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds
sufficient  to pay  the aggregate Merger Consideration payable upon
conversion of Shares  pursuant to  Section 3.1(c). For purposes of
determining the aggregate amount to be  so  deposited, Parent shall assume
that no stockholder of the Company  shall perfect  any right to appraisal of
his, her or its Shares. Such funds shall  not be used  for any purpose other
than as set forth in this Article III, and  shall be  invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving  Corporation  in (i) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii)  obligations for  which
the full faith and credit of the United States of America  is pledged to 
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial  paper

funds  investing  solely in any of the foregoing; _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that no  such investment or losses therefrom shall affect the Merger
Consideration,  and  Parent shall promptly deposit or cause the Surviving
Corporation  promptly to  deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent for
the benefit of  the former  stockholders of the Company in the amount of any
such losses. Any  net profit  resulting from, or interest or income produced
by, such investments  will be  payable to Merger Sub or Parent, as Parent
directs.

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_.  As  promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event  more than five  (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause  the Paying Agent  to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate representing  Shares which were  converted
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) into the right to receive  the Merger 
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify  that
delivery  shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to each Certificate 
shall pass,  only upon delivery of such Certificate to the Paying Agent and 
shall be in such  form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may  reasonably  specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender  of each such  Certificate in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender  of a Certificate to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter  of transmittal,  duly executed, and such other
documents as the Paying Agent may  reasonably  require, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive  in exchange  therefor the Merger
Consideration (subject to subsection (e) of  this Section  3.2) for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate, to  be mailed  within ten
(10) Business Days of receipt of such Certificate and  letter of 
transmittal by the Paying Agent, and the Certificate so surrendered  shall 
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is  to be made
to a  Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate  is  registered, it shall be a condition of payment of the
Merger Consideration  that  the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall  be otherwise  in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such  payment shall  have paid any Tax required by reason
of the payment of the Merger  Consideration  to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate  surrendered or  shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation  that  such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered  as  contemplated by this
Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed  at any time  after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive  the Merger 
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 3.2.

 

 

(c) _Transfer  Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_.  After  the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall  be closed
and  there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on  the
records of  the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates  evidencing  ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective  Time shall  cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as  otherwise  provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective  Time,  Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any  reason, they  shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article III.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Fund; No Liability_.  At any  time following six (6)
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver  to it any  funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) which  had been made  available to
the Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration  and  which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter  such 
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation,  which
shall  thereafter act as the Paying Agent (subject to abandoned property, 
escheat or  other similar Law), as general creditors of the Surviving
Corporation  with  respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be  payable upon  surrender of any Certificate, as determined pursuant
to this Agreement,  without  any interest thereon. Any portion of the funds
made available to  the Paying  Agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed  as of a  date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would  otherwise  escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Entity shall,  to the extent  permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

**BACK**

 

 


 

 

Corporation,  free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously  entitled  thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation  nor  the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate  for Merger  Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable  abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

(e) _Withholding  Taxes_.  The  right of any Person to receive payment or
consideration payable  upon surrender  of a Certificate pursuant to the
Merger will be subject to any  applicable  requirements with respect to the
withholding of any Tax. To the  extent amounts  are so withheld by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying  Agent, (i)  such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as  having been paid to
the holder of Shares or Certificates, as applicable,  in  respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made and (ii)  Parent shall,  or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as  the case may  be,
to, promptly pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate 
Governmental  Entity.

 

 

(f) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  In the  event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,  upon the making  of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate  to be
lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving 
Corporation,  the delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as
Parent  or the Surviving  Corporation may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim  that may be  made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation  on account of  the alleged loss, theft or destruction
of such Certificate, the  Paying Agent  will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate  the Merger  Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof as determined in accordance  with  this Article III.

 

 

Section  3.3. _Dissenting  Shares_.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary,  Shares which  are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time  and which are  held by holders who
shall have complied with the provisions of  Section 262 of  the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting  Shares_ ")  shall  not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration,  and holders  of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive payment  of the fair value  of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of  Section 262 of  the DGCL, unless and
until the applicable holder fails to comply  with the  provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL or effectively withdraws  or otherwise  loses such holder's
rights to receive payment of the fair value of such holder's  Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,  any such  holder
fails to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the  DGCL or 
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares  shall 
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted at the Effective  Time
into  the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding 
anything to the  contrary contained in this Section 3.3, if this Agreement is
terminated  prior to  the Effective Time, then the right of any holder of
Shares to be  paid the fair  value of such holder's Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL  shall cease. The Company shall give
Parent notice of any written  demands for  appraisal of Shares received by
the Company under Section 262 of  the DGCL, and  shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in negotiations  and proceedings  with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with  the prior  written consent
of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to  any such demands  for
appraisal, (ii) offer to settle or settle any such demands,  (iii) waive
any  failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance 
with the  DGCL or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

the Effective Time, the Company's 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and 2002 Stock 
Incentive Plan **** shall  terminate. Parent and the Company shall take all
actions necessary  to provide  that, effective as of the Effective Time: (i)
each outstanding option to  buy Shares granted under the Company Option Plans
(" _Company  Option_ "),  whether or not such Company Options are then
exercisable and vested,  shall be  cancelled; and (ii) in consideration of
such cancellation, Parent shall, or  shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay to each holder of  Company Options,  whether or not such Company
Options are then exercisable and vested,  an amount  in respect thereof
equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any,  of the  greater of (A) the
Merger Consideration or (B) in the case of any Nonqualified  Stock Option, 
the  Adjusted Fair Market Value (the terms "Nonqualified Stock Option" and
"Adjusted  Fair Market Value" having the meanings assigned thereto in the
applicable  Company Option Plan) of each Share subject to such Company
Option  over the  exercise price of each Company Option held by such holder
and (y)  the number of  Shares subject thereto (such payment, if any, to be
net of applicable  withholding and excise taxes). The Surviving Corporation
shall  (and Parent shall  cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay such
amounts under this  Section 3.4 as  soon as practicable following (but in no
event more than three  (3) Business Days  after) the Effective Time to the
holder of each such Company  Option.

Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries is duly

date  of  this Agreement (collectively, the " _SEC  Documents_ ").  As
of  their respective dates (or if subsequently amended or superseded  by a

the SEC  Documents, including any financial statements or schedules
included  therein, as  finally amended, complied as to form in all material
respects with  the  applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act,  as the case  may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder  applicable to such SEC Documents (as the Securities
Act or the  Exchange Act and  the rules and regulation promulgated
thereunder were in effect  on the date so  filed), and none of the SEC
Documents, when finally amended prior  to the date  hereof, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted  to state a  material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order  to make the  statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they  were made,  not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no  outstanding or 
unresolved comments in comment letters received by the Company  from the
SEC  staff with respect to any of the SEC Documents. No Company Subsidiary 
is  required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the  SEC.

statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and  the absence of 
footnotes).

evaluation prior to the  date hereof, to  the Company's auditors and the
audit committee of the Board of Directors of  the  Company, (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses  in the design  or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting which  are
reasonably  likely to adversely effect in any material respect the Company's
ability to  record, process, summarize and report financial information and 
(y) any fraud,  whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees  who have a  significant role in the Company's internal controls
over financial reporting. To  the Company's Knowledge, there is no reason to
believe, after completion of  all  remediation set forth on Section 4.5(c)
of the Company Disclosure  Schedule and  any other remediation the costs of
which would not be material  to the Company  and the Company Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, that its auditors  and its chief  executive officer will
not be able to give the certifications and  attestations  required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant  to Section 404  of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 when next due. Since May 28,  2005,  (i) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor, to the Company's  Knowledge, any
director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant  or  representative of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries  has received  any written
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the  Company or any of  the
Company Subsidiaries has engaged in improper or illegal accounting  or 
auditing practices or maintains improper or inadequate internal

the  terms of this Agreement, and including any such Contract that is 
entered into,  or such Permit that is obtained, after the date of this
Agreement,  as long as  entering into such Contract or obtaining such Permit
does not violate  any  provision of this Agreement, or (iv) incurred
pursuant to or in  connection with  this Agreement or the Transactions and

the Company  has made available to Parent (i) a complete and correct copy
of  such plan or a  summary of such plan, (ii) any summary plan description,

operated,  funded and  administered, in all material respects, in accordance
with its  terms, the terms  of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement and the requirements  of ERISA  and the Code and any other
applicable Laws. All contributions and  premium  payments that are due with

Revenue  Service that such Benefit Plan is so qualified (taking into
account  the  legislation commonly referred to as "GUST") or is a prototype
plan which is the  subject of an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue

circumstances that would be  reasonably likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any  such Benefit  Plan.

 

 

(e) There  have been no prohibited transactions (as defined in Section 406 
of ERISA or  Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Benefit Plan,
and  no fiduciary (as  defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) has any Liability
for breach  of fiduciary  duty or any other failure to act or comply in
connection with the  administration  or investment of the assets of any
Benefit Plan that, in either  case, would  reasonably be expected to result
in a material Liability to the  Company or the  Company Subsidiaries. There
are no actions, suits, proceedings,  hearings, (to  the Company's Knowledge)
investigations, claims (other than routine claims  for  benefits in the
ordinary course) pending or, to the Company's Knowledge,  threatened in
writing with respect to any Benefit Plan, other than  any such  matters that
would not be reasonably expected to have, individually  or in the 
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

dependant thereof) other than in accordance  with COBRA. The  Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates are  in compliance in  all
material respects with the requirements of COBRA.

 

 

(h) Those  individuals performing services for the Company and the Company 
Subsidiaries  have been correctly classified as common law employees,
leased  employees,  independent contractors or agents of the Company or the
Company  Subsidiaries for  the purposes of each Benefit Plan. The
Transactions will not cause  the  acceleration of vesting in, or payment of,
any benefits under any  Benefit Plan  and shall not otherwise accelerate or
increase any Liability under  any Benefit  Plan.

or in the aggregate, a Company Material  Adverse  Effect. No loss or
expiration of any material Company-Owned Intellectual  Property is pending
or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened in writing and  all material

under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation  and has  the
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of  its 
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being

business  in  each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by  it or the  character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased  by it makes  such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure  to be so  licensed or qualified would not, when
aggregated with all other such  failures,  be reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on Parent's or  Merger Sub's ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or prevent  or delay the consummation of the
Transactions (a " _Parent  Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

**BACK**

 

 

 

 



 

 

Section  5.2. _Authority_.  Each of  Parent and Merger Sub has all
necessary corporate power and authority  to execute  and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions to be  consummated  by it. The

Parent or  Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
by  Parent and  Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by each of
Parent  and Merger  Sub of the Transactions to be consummated by it. This
Agreement has  been duly  executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub,
and, assuming due  and valid  authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement,  constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
each of Parent and Merger  Sub,  enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, except  that such  enforceability (i) may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium  or other  similar Laws

Agreement  or the  consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions to  be  consummated by it, or compliance by Parent and Merger
Sub with any  of the terms  and provisions of this Agreement, will (i)
violate any provision of  the  Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or
similar organizational  documents  with different names) of Parent or Merger
Sub or (ii) assuming that  the Parent  Approvals are obtained or made, as
the case may be, (x) violate any  Law  applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective properties  or  assets or (y) violate, result in the
loss of any material benefit under,  constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time,  or both,  would constitute a default) under,
result in the termination of or  a right of  termination or cancellation
under, accelerate the performance required  by,  require the consent of or
notice to any Person under or result in the  creation  of any Lien upon any

affected, except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations,

connection  with  the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

 

(b) The  authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of 
common stock,  par value $0.01 per share, of which 1,000 shares are issued
and outstanding.  All  such issued and outstanding shares are owned
beneficially and of record  by  Parent.

 

 

Section  5.5. _Sufficient  Funds_.  Prior  to  the date of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company complete,  correct and
executed copies of (i) the letter dated January  18, 2006,  from Banc

pursuant  to which the parties thereto have committed, subject to the terms

financing  of up to  $2,075,000,000 in connection with the Transactions (the
" _Debt  Commitments_ "  )  and (ii)  the letter dated January  18, 
2006,  from Bain  Capital Fund VIII, L.P. (" _Bain_ ")  pursuant to which
Bain and or its Affiliates have committed, subject  to the  terms and

financing of up to $500,000,000 in connection with the Transactions  (the "
_Equity  Commitment_ " and,  together with the Debt Commitments, the "
_Financing  Commitments_ "),  with  respect to the financing of the

payable by either of  them.  Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the  Company set  forth in Article IV, as of the date of
this Agreement Parent and Merger  Sub have  no reason to believe that any of
the conditions precedent to the Financing  will  not be satisfied in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions  or that  the Financing
will not be available to Parent  and/or Merger  Sub on the Closing Date.

 

 

Section  5.6. _Ownership  of Shares_.  Each of  Parent and Merger Sub is

financial advisor, broker or finder in  a manner  that would result in any
Liability for any broker's fees, commissions or  finder's fees in connection

Financing, any alternative financing, the payment of the aggregate  Merger 
Consideration and  payment in respect of the Company Options contemplated by
Section  3.4,  and  payment of all related fees and expenses, each of
Parent and the Surviving  Corporation will be Solvent. For the purposes of
this Section 5.9 the  term " _Solvent_ "  when  used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination,  (a) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will,  as of such date,
exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,  including
contingent and other liabilities", as of such date, as such quoted  terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable federal  laws  governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the  amount that  will
be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on  its existing 
debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute  and 
matured, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably 
small  amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is 
engaged or  proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person
will  be able to  pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as  they mature.  For purposes of this definition, (i) "not
have an unreasonably small amount of  capital for the operation of the

Section  6.2. _No  Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) From  and  after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective  Time or the  termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company  agrees  that (x) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall not, and the  Company and  the Company Subsidiaries shall
cause each of their respective officers,  directors, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker,  financial advisor,
attorney or accountant retained by the Company or  any of the  Company
Subsidiaries or any of the foregoing), and shall use reasonable  best 
efforts to cause their other employees (such officers, directors, agents, 
representatives and employees, collectively, " _Representatives_ "),  not 
to, initiate or solicit (including by way of furnishing non-public 
information)  or knowingly take any other action to facilitate the making of
any  proposal or  offer that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead
to, an Alternative  Proposal or engage in any substantive discussions or any
negotiations  concerning, or provide any non-public information with respect
to,  an  Alternative Proposal, and (y) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries  shall  immediately cease, and cause their respective
Representatives (other  than  non-officer employees, for whom they shall use
reasonable best efforts)  to  cease, any existing solicitation, discussions
or negotiations by or  on behalf of  the Company with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any  Alternative  Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation  of the  foregoing by a
Representative (other than a non-officer employee) or  a Company  Subsidiary
shall be a violation of this Section 6.2(a) by the  Company.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
(directly or  through its  Representatives) may (i) until receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval,  engage in substantive discussions or in
negotiations with a Person  that makes a  bona fide written Alternative
Proposal (under circumstances in which  the Company  has complied in all
respects with its non-solicitation obligations  under Section  6.2(a)) and
may furnish such Person and its representatives information  concerning, and
may afford such Person and its representatives access  to, the  Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and their businesses, properties,  assets,  books
and records, if (A) in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of 
Directors (after consultation with the Company's financial advisor and
outside  counsel) such Alternative Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably
likely  to lead  to, a Superior Proposal, and (B) prior to furnishing such
information  or access  to, or entering into substantive discussions (except
as to the existence  of this  Section 6.2) or negotiations with, such
Person, (x) the Company receives  from  such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive  of such  Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the Company notifies  Parent to  the
effect that it intends to furnish information or access to, or  intends to 
enter into substantive discussions or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

**BACK**

 

 

 

 



 

 

negotiations  with, such Person, (ii) comply with Rules 14e-2 and 14d-9 of
the Exchange  Act  Rules with regard to a tender or exchange offer, (iii)
make a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to its stockholders of the
nature  contemplated by Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act Rules and (iv) make 
such other  disclosures to the Company's stockholders, and take such other
actions, as are  required by Law. In addition to the obligations of the
Company and  the Company  Subsidiaries set forth in clause (i) of this
Section 6.2(b), the Company  shall  promptly advise Parent in writing of any
Alternative Proposal, and  any notice  shall specify in writing the material
terms and conditions of any such  Alternative Proposal and the identity of
the person making such Alternative  Proposal.

 

 

(c) The  Board  of Directors of the Company may not (i) withdraw or modify
the approval or  recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company of
the Merger  or this  Agreement (except as set forth in clause (y) of the
proviso to Section  2.6(a)(ii) or as set forth below in this Section 6.2(c)),
(ii) approve  or  recommend an Alternative Proposal or (iii) cause the
Company or any  of the  Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement  in principle,  merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture  agreement, partnership agreement or other
similar agreement related  to any  Alternative Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement in accordance  with  Section 6.2(b)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to  receipt of  the Company
Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of the  Company  (after
consultation with the Company's financial advisor and outside counsel) 
determines in good faith that any Alternative Proposal which was not 
solicited  in violation of Section 6.2(a) constitutes a Superior Proposal,
the  Board of  Directors of the Company may, if it has fully complied with
Section  6.2(b): (w)  withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the Merger and  this  Agreement, (x) approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal, (y) cause  the  Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
enter into a binding  written  agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement as aforesaid) with  respect to,  and containing the terms of, such
Superior Proposal (a " _Superior  Proposal Agreement_ ")  and  (z)
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(c); _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  (A) prior to terminating this Agreement, the Company
shall give Parent  at least  two (2) Business Days' notice thereof,
attaching the Superior Proposal Agreement  or, if applicable, the latest
draft thereof (which notice need only  be given  once with respect to any
Superior Proposal, unless such Superior Proposal  is  modified in any
material respect), and (B) if, within such two (2)  Business Day  period,
Parent makes an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company  determines
in good faith is at least as favorable to the stockholders  of the  Company
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates),  from a 
financial point of view, as such Superior Proposal and agrees in writing  to
all  adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as are
necessary  to  reflect such offer, the Company's notice of termination with
respect to such  Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be rescinded and of no
further  force and  effect and, if the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
entered into  a Superior  Proposal Agreement, it shall promptly terminate
such agreement (it  being agreed  that the Company will cause any Superior
Proposal Agreement entered  into prior  to the expiration of such two (2)
Business Day period to include a  provision  permitting such termination).

 

 

Section  6.3. _Publicity_.  The  initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement  shall be a  joint press release reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company.  Thereafter,  so long as this
Agreement is in effect, none of the Company, Parent  or any of  their
respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of  any press 
release or other

announcement  with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
Transactions  without the  prior approval of the Company and Parent, except
as may be required  by Law or by  any listing agreement with a securities
exchange or Nasdaq as determined  in the  good faith judgment, upon advice
of counsel, of the party wanting to  make such  release or announcement (in
which case the party shall use its commercially  reasonable efforts to
receive the approval of the other party prior  to issuing  such release). In
addition, promptly following the date of this Agreement,  the  Company and
Parent shall establish mutually agreeable talking points  that may be  made
to any supplier, vendor or other material business relation of  the Company 
and the Company Subsidiaries regarding the Transactions and the impact  of 
Transactions on the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries 
(the " _Approved  Communications_ ").  The Company shall inform its
directors, officers and any direct reports  to  officers who communicate
with the Company\'s suppliers, vendors or other  material  business
relations in the ordinary course of their employment that  all 
communications made to such suppliers, vendors or other material business 
relations regarding the Transactions and the impact of Transactions  on the 
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries must comply with  the 
Approved Communications, and the Company shall use its reasonable best 
efforts  to ensure such compliance. Furthermore, the Company shall use its 
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all communications made by directors 
and  executive officers of the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries 
to  non-executive employees of the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries  regarding the Transactions, and the impact of the Transactions
on the  business  of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, comply in all
material  respects  with the Approved Communications. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing  in this  Section 6.3 shall prohibit any communication to any
supplier, vendor  or other  material business relation made in the ordinary
course of business.

 

 

Section  6.4. _Access  to Information_.

 

 

(a) Upon  reasonable notice and subject to applicable Law, the Company
shall,  and shall  cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers,  employees,  accountants, counsel and other representatives of
Parent and, subject  to the  terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, its
debt financing sources,  during  normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time,  reasonable  access to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records,  and to  its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives  and,  during such period,
the Company shall, and shall cause the Company  Subsidiaries  to, make
available to Parent and the appropriate representatives of  Parent (i) a 
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document 
filed  or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of 
federal  securities Laws (other than reports or documents which the Company 
is not  permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii) all other
information  concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably  request. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,  neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required  to  provide access to or to disclose information if such access or
disclosure  would  jeopardize the work product privilege or the attorney-
client privilege  of the  institution in possession or control of such
information or violate  any Law or  any binding agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement. 

 

 

(b) The  Company makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of
any  information provided pursuant to Section 6.4(a), and neither Merger Sub
nor  Parent may rely

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

**BACK**

 

 

 

 



 

 

on  the  accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as
expressly  set forth  in the Company's representations and warranties
contained in Article  IV.

 

 

(c) The  information provided pursuant to Section 6.4(a) will be used
solely  for the  purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed
by all the  terms and  conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

Section  6.5. _Further  Assurances; Regulatory Matters; Notification of
Certain Matters_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger  Sub and  the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
use all reasonable  best  efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper  or  advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements which may  be imposed on  such party with respect to the Merger
or the other Transactions and,  subject to  the conditions set forth in
Article VII, to consummate the Transactions  as  promptly as practicable and
(ii) promptly to prepare and file all necessary  documentation, to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions,  filings  and other documents,
and to use all reasonable best efforts to obtain,  all  necessary permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental  Entities
necessary or advisable in connection with consummating the  Transactions,
including the Other Company Approvals and Parent Approvals.  Without limiting
the generality of this Section 6.5(a), each party  shall, within  ten (10)
Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, file  all necessary 
documentation required to obtain all requisite approvals or termination  of 
applicable waiting periods for the Transactions under the HSR Act.

 

 

(b) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained  in  Section 6.5(a), each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable  best efforts  to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect  to any of  the Transactions by or under the HSR Act,
the Federal Trade Commission  or the  Department of Justice, including
taking all reasonable actions to obtain  clearance, or if such clearance
cannot be obtained, to reach an agreement,  settlement or consent providing
for divestiture, a "hold separate" agreement,  contractual undertakings with
third Persons or any other relief with  the  Governmental Entity
investigating the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the
foregoing shall not require any party to agree to any asset divestiture  or 
restriction on its or its Subsidiaries' business operations that would be 
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, 
results  of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries  taken as  a whole. In connection with the foregoing, if any
administrative or  judicial  action or proceeding, including any proceeding
by a private Person,  is  instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any of the  Transactions  as violative of the HSR Act or any
other antitrust or other Law in  any  jurisdiction, the parties hereto shall
cooperate in all respects with  each other  and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist  any such  action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned  any 
judgment or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,  that
is in  effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the 
Transactions, including defending through litigation on the merits  any
claim  asserted in any such action or proceeding by any Person.

 

 

(c) Each  party hereto shall give prompt notice (or in the case of clause
(iii),  use its  reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice) to the other
party hereto  if any  of the

following  occur after the date of this Agreement: (i) receipt of any notice
or  other  communication in writing from any Person alleging that the
consent  or approval  of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
receipt of any notice or other  communication from any Governmental Entity or
any securities market  or  securities regulator in connection with the
Transactions; or (iii)  the  occurrence of an event which individually has
had or would be reasonably  likely  in the future to (A) have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent  Material  Adverse Effect, as
applicable, or prevent or delay the consummation  of the  Merger or (B)
cause any condition to the obligations of any party hereto  to  consummate
the Merger to be unsatisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no 
disclosure by any party hereto pursuant to this Section 6.5(c) shall  be
deemed  to amend or supplement this Agreement or the schedules hereto or to 
prevent or  cure any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained  herein.

 

 

Section  6.6. _Employee  Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) Parent  shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in
accordance  with  their terms all the Benefit Plans.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for at
least two (2)  years  following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving  Corporation  to, provide employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries  with  compensation and employee benefits
(other than any equity-based benefits)  which,  in the aggregate, are no
less favorable to such employees than the  compensation  and employee
benefits (including any equity-based benefits) in effect  for such 
employees immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to (i) require Parent  or the 
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to provide equity-based benefits 
or  otherwise issue equity to any employee or (ii) restrict the ability  of
the  Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving Corporation 
or any of  their Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at
any  time and for  any or no reason.

 

 

(c) Parent  shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries  to, (i)  credit all service with the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries  (including service recognized by the Company or any of
the Company  Subsidiaries  for service with other Persons) for all purposes
(other than benefit  accrual  under a "defined benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(35) of  ERISA) under any employee benefit plan, policy
or program (other than  any  equity-based plan, policy or program)
applicable to employees of the  Surviving  Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Closing to the extent  recognized by the Company under
a corresponding Benefit Plan, (ii)  in the plan  year in which the Closing
occurs, use reasonable best efforts to waive  any  pre-existing condition or
limitation or exclusion with respect to employees  of  the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries under any group health  plan or  other welfare
benefit plan to the extent waived or satisfied under  an analogous  Benefit
Plan as of the Closing Date, and (iii) in the plan year in  which the 
Closing occurs use reasonable best efforts to recognize the dollar  amount of
all  expenses incurred by employees of the Company or any of the Company 
Subsidiaries  and their dependents for purposes of deductibles, co-payments
and maximum  out-of  pocket limits under any group health plan to the extent
recognized  under an  analogues Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date.

(d) The  provisions of this Section 6.6 are for the sole benefit of the
parties  to this  Agreement and their permitted successors and assigns, and
nothing herein,  expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give any
Person,  other than  the parties hereto and such permitted successors and
assigns, any legal  or  equitable rights hereunder.

 

 

Section  6.7. _Indemnification  and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) Without  limiting any additional rights that any director, officer or
other  employee of  the Company may have under any indemnification or other
agreement,  any Benefit  Plan or  the  Company Certificate or Company By-
laws,  from and  after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall,  jointly  and severally (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to),  indemnify,  defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted  under  the DGCL or other applicable
Law, each Person who is now, or has been  at any  time prior to the date of
this Agreement or who becomes such prior  to the  Effective Time, (i) an
officer or director of the Company or any of  the Company  Subsidiaries or
(ii) an employee of the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries providing
services to or for such director or officer  in connection  with this
Agreement or any of the Transactions (such officers, directors  and 
employees, individually, an " _Indemnified  Party_ ," and  collectively,
the " _Indemnified  Parties_ ")  (in  such Person's capacity as such and
not as stockholders or optionholders of the  Company) against any and all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses  (including  attorneys' fees and
disbursements), fines, liabilities and judgments and amounts  that are paid
in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party  (which  approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (collectively,  "
_Indemnified  Liabilities_ ")  incurred  in connection with any pending,
threatened or completed claim, action,  suit,  proceeding or investigation
(each, a " _Proceeding_ ")  arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that
such Person is or  was an  officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent
of the Company or any  of the  Company Subsidiaries or (ii) matters
occurring or existing at or prior  to the  Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection  with this  Agreement and the
Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior  to, at or  after, the
Effective Time. In the event any claim for Indemnified Liabilities  is 
asserted or made by an Indemnified Party, any determination required  to be
made  with respect to whether such Indemnified Party's conduct complies with
the  standards set forth under the DGCL or other applicable Law shall be 
made by  independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Party and
reasonably  acceptable to the Surviving Corporation. Parent shall, or shall
cause  the  Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance all reasonable out-
of-pocket  expenses  of each Indemnified Party in connection with any
Proceeding as such  expenses  (including attorneys' fees and disbursements)
are incurred upon receipt from  such Indemnified Party of a request therefor
(accompanied by invoices  or other  relevant documentation), _provided_  
(if and  to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable Law) that
such  Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such amount if it is ultimately 
determined  that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
under  the DGCL or  other applicable Law with respect to such Proceeding. In
the event  any  Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party, Parent
and the  Surviving  Corporation shall each use all reasonable best efforts
to assist in  the vigorous  defense of such matter, _provided_   that 
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise  or
consent  to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding  (and in  which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder) 
without  the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if  and to 
the extent the claimant seeks any non-monetary relief from such Indemnified 
Party.

(b) All  rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all
exculpations  and  limitations of the personal Liability of, the directors,
officers,  employees,  fiduciaries and agents of any of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries  in the  Company Certificate or Company By-Laws (or
comparable organizational  documents  of the Company Subsidiaries) as in
effect as of the Effective Time  with respect  to matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the  Merger and  the other
Transactions, shall continue in full force and effect for  a period of  not
less than six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims asserted or 
made within  such period shall continue until the final disposition of such 
claim.

 

 

(c) For  a  period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation  shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall
cause  the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in
effect the current  directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
maintained by any of the Company and  the Company Subsidiaries for the
benefit of those Persons who are covered  by  such policies at the date of
this Agreement or the Effective Time with  respect  to claims arising in
whole or in part from matters occurring or allegedly  occurring prior to the
Effective Time (provided that the Surviving  Corporation  and its
Subsidiaries may substitute therefor policies of at least the  same 
coverage containing terms and conditions that are at least as beneficial  to
the  beneficiaries of the current policies and with reputable carriers
having  a  rating comparable to the Company's current carrier); _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall,  and  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to,  first use  its reasonable best efforts to obtain a
"tail" policy on substantially the same  terms and conditions for claims
arising out of acts or conduct occurring  on or  prior to the Effective Time
and effective for claims asserted during  the full  six (6)-year period
referred to above, and only if Parent and the Surviving  Corporation and its
Subsidiaries are unable, after exerting their reasonable  best efforts, to
obtain such a "tail" policy, then Parent or the Surviving  Corporation and
its Subsidiaries will be required to obtain such coverage  from  such
carriers in annual policies; and, _provided_ ,  _further_   that (i)  if
the existing policies expire or are terminated or canceled during  such six 
(6)- year period, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and  its 
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation  and
its  Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
substantially  similar  policies with reputable carriers having a rating
comparable to the  Company's  current carrier, (ii) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries,  as the case may be, shall not be required
to spend as an annual premium  therefor  an amount in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium  therefor as of the date of this
Agreement and (iii) if, during such  six (6)-year  period, such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be  obtained  only for an amount
in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the  current  annual premium
therefor, Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its  Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, shall use all reasonable best efforts  to cause  to be obtained
as much directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as  can be
obtained for an amount equal to three hundred percent (300%)  of the 
current annual premium therefor, on terms and conditions substantially 
similar  to the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time the Company
shall be permitted  to  purchase prepaid "tail" policies in favor of the
individuals referred to in  Section 6.7(c) with respect to the matters
described therein (provided  that the  annual premium

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

**BACK**

 

 

 

 



 

 

therefor  shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium  therefor as  of the date of this Agreement). If and to the extent
such policies  have been  obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause  the  Surviving Corporation to, maintain such
policies in effect and continue  to honor  the obligations thereunder.

 

 

(e) Parent  shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform  in  accordance with their terms all indemnification agreements
identified  on Section  4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and in
effect as of the date  of this  Agreement between the Company, on the one
hand, and any director or  officer of  the Company, on the other hand.

 

 

(f) The  provisions of this Section 6.7 (x) are intended to be for the
benefit  of, and  shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and  his or her  personal representatives, (y) shall be binding on
Parent and the Surviving  Corporation and their respective successors and
assigns and (z) are  in addition  to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification  or  contribution that any such Person may have by
Contract or  otherwise.

 

 

(g) In  the  event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other  Person and  shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such  consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or a majority
of its  properties  and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision  shall be  made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving  Corporation,  as the case may be (and such Person's
ultimate parent entity, if applicable),  assume the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 6.7.

 

 

Section  6.8. _Obligations  of Merger Sub_.  Prior  to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement  in  accordance with
Section 8.1:

 

 

(a) Merger  Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to,
undertake  any business  or activities other than in connection with this
Agreement and engaging  in the  Merger and the other Transactions.

 

 

(b) Parent  shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform
its  obligations  under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions  on  the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

 

(c) Parent  and Merger Sub shall not engage in any action or enter into any
transaction  or  permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered
into that  could  reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of, or
otherwise adversely  affect, the Merger or any of the other Transactions.
Without limiting  the  generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and
shall cause its  Subsidiaries  not to, acquire (whether via merger,
consolidation, stock or asset  purchase or  otherwise), or agree to so
acquire, any material amounts of assets  of or any  equity in any Person or
any business or division thereof, unless that  acquisition or agreement would
not (i) impose any delay in the obtaining  of, or  increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders,  declarations or approvals
of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate  the  Merger or the other
Transactions or the expiration or termination of  any waiting  period under
applicable Law, or (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental  Entity

entering  an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or the other
Transactions  or increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order
on  appeal or  otherwise.

 

 

Section  6.9. _Financing_.

 

 

(a) Prior  to  the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable
best  efforts to  obtain the Financing, including entering into definitive
agreements  with respect  thereto on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Financing Commitments  or  such other terms as may be acceptable to
Parent in its sole discretion  (provided  that the same or more favorable
terms than those set forth in the Financing  Commitments shall be deemed
acceptable to Parent). In the event that  any portion  of the Financing
becomes unavailable so as not to enable Parent and  Merger Sub  to proceed
with the Transactions in a timely manner, Parent and Merger  Sub shall  use
their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternate financing 
from  alternative sources on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent in 
its sole  discretion (provided that the same or more favorable terms than
those  set forth  in the Financing Commitments shall be deemed acceptable to
Parent)  as promptly  as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
including entering  into  definitive agreements with respect thereto (such
definitive agreements  entered  into pursuant to the first or second
sentence of this Section 6.9(a)  being  referred to as the " _Definitive 
Financing Agreements_ ");  provided that nothing in this Section 6.9(a) shall
be deemed to require  Bain to  provide a greater amount of equity financing
than is contemplated by  the Equity  Commitment. Parent and Merger Sub
shall, shall cause their Affiliates  to, and  shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their Representatives  to,  comply with the terms and
satisfy on a timely basis the conditions  of the  Financing Commitments, the
Definitive Financing Agreements, any alternate  financing commitment and any
related fee and engagement letters. Parent  shall  (i) furnish complete,
correct and executed copies of the Definitive  Financing  Agreements to the
Company promptly upon their execution, (ii) give  the Company  prompt notice
of any breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitments,  any
alternate financing commitment or the Definitive Financing Agreements  of 
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof  and
(iii)  otherwise at the reasonable request of the Company inform the
Company  of the  status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any
replacements  thereof).

 

 

(b) From  and  after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective  Time or the  termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company  shall,  and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, at Parent\'s sole expense  (except as  provided in the fourth sentence
of this Section 6.9(b)), reasonably  cooperate  with Parent and Parent's
Affiliates in connection with the arrangement of the  Financing (or any
replacements thereof),  including (i) participation in due diligence 
sessions, meetings, drafting sessions, management presentation
sessions, "road  shows", and sessions with rating agencies by Company 
officers  and  employees, (ii) assisting Parent in obtaining any title
insurance lien  waivers,  estoppels, affidavits, non-disturbance agreements,
memoranda of leases,  legal  opinions, surveys or other documents or
deliveries, (iii) using reasonable  best  efforts to prepare business
projections, financial statements, pro  forma  statements and other
financial data of the type required by Regulation  S-X and  Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act of the type and form consistently  included in
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses  and  similar
documents, all as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iv)  the 
execution and delivery of underwriting or placement agreements, loan 
agreements,  note purchase agreements, registration rights agreements,

indentures  and related documents, including a certificate of the chief
accounting  officer  of the Company with respect to solvency matters, and
using reasonable  best  efforts to obtain accountants\' comfort letters and
consents of accountants  for  use of their reports in any materials relating
to the Debt Commitment,  all as  may be reasonably requested by Parent, (v)
reasonably facilitating  the pledging  of collateral and (vi) providing the
financial information necessary  for the  satisfaction of the obligations
and conditions set forth in the Debt  Commitments  within the time periods
required thereby in order to permit a Closing  Date on or  prior to the date
set forth in Section 8.1(b)(2), which obligation  shall  include, in all
events, providing the financial information required  pursuant to  the terms
of the Debt Commitments; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  (x) such 
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing 
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and (y) neither  the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to make any  payment
or  expenditure in connection with the financing cooperation described  in
this  Section 6.9(b) in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Financing  Cooperation Expense Cap_ ").  The  parties agree that  the 
effectiveness of any documents referred to in the preceding sentence  shall
be  subject to the consummation of the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing  provisions of this Section 6.9(b), (i) the Company shall, and
shall cause  each of the Company Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with
Parent\'s  financing sources and their representatives in connection with
the  completion of  an inventory appraisal and a field examination customary
for inventory  and  receivables financings (each of which shall be conducted
during normal  business  hours (so  long  as not disruptive to the
Company\'s operations) and  after  reasonable prior notice, and  (ii)  (x)
the Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity  to
review  and comment upon any offering memorandum that includes information 
about the  Company prepared in connection with the Financing (and the Parent
shall  not  disseminate any offering memorandum relating to any offering of
the  Company's or  any Company Subsidiary's securities under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act  without the prior consent of the Company, which consent
shall not be  unreasonably withheld), and (y) Parent and Merger Sub and their
counsel  shall be  given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any offering  memorandum  prepared in connection with any financing
undertaken by the Company  to finance  the Dividend.  In  the  event that
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  Section  8.1(c)(ii)
or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section  8.1(b)(ii),  Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company  for  all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company 
Subsidiaries in connection with such financing cooperation, including  all
amounts up to and including the Financing Cooperation Expense Cap,  and 
_provided_ _further_ ,  that if  this Agreement is terminated for any
reason, Parent shall use its best  efforts  to cause the voiding,
termination and/or destruction of all documents  executed  by the Company in
connection with such financing cooperation, and shall  reimburse the Company
for all costs and expenses incurred by the Company  in  connection
therewith.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither  the Company  nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required
to pay any commitment  or  other similar fee or incur any other Liability in
connection with the  Financing  (or any replacements thereof) prior to the
Effective Time (except as  expressly  set forth above with respect to the
Financing Cooperation Expense Cap).  Furthermore,  notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries, nor any
of their respective officers or directors shall  be  required to execute any
certificate, representation letter or other  certification, or  to 
deliver, or cause to be delivered, any legal opinion to  the  extent the
Company determines in good faith that, under the circumstances,  the 
execution of such

certificate,  letter or other certification, or  delivery of such opinion
is  not  customary or would be unreasonable.

8.1(b)(iv),  and if at the time of such termination an Alternative Proposal
remains  outstanding and (ii) the Company consummates a transaction
agreement  with  respect to such Alternative Proposal within twelve (12)
months of the  date of  such termination, then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination  Fee as  promptly as reasonably practicable (and in

Agreement to the contrary, for purposes  of this  Section 8.3(b) and Section
8.3(c), the term "Alternative Proposal" shall have  the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 1.1, except that the applicable  percentages in clauses

or failure  to  perform, as the case may be, and (i) at the time of such
breach an  Alternative  Proposal remains outstanding and (ii) the Company
consummates a transaction  agreement with respect to such Alternative
Proposal within twelve (12)  months of  the date of such termination, then
the Company shall pay to Parent  the  Termination Fee as promptly as

after such consummation, payable by wire transfer  of same  day funds.

 

 

(d) If  (i)  Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii)
and  at the time  of such termination, (x) Parent or Merger Sub has breached
or failed  to perform  any of its covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement  such that  the closing condition set forth in Section 7.3(a)
would not be satisfied or  (y) there exists a breach of any representation or
warranty of Parent or  Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the
closing condition  set forth  in Section 7.3(b) would not be satisfied, (ii)
the Company terminates this  Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) and at

7.2(a), 7.2(b), 7.2(d), 7.2(e),  7.2(f) and  7.2(g) would be satisfied
(provided that for purposes of this Section  8.3(d),  the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(e) shall be deemed to have been  satisfied  if the
Persons set forth on Schedule 7.2(e) have indicated in writing  their 
willingness to execute the Non-Competition Agreement simultaneously  with
the  consummation of the Closing; provided further that such writing shall 
in no way  be construed to give any operative effect to the Non-Competition
Agreement),  or  (iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii)  then,  in any such case, Parent shall pay to the Company
$70,000,000 (such  amount, the " _Parent  Termination Fee_ ")  as 
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) 
Business  Days) after termination, payable by wire transfer of same day
funds. 

 

 

(e) Except  to  the extent required by applicable Law, neither the Company
nor Parent  shall  withhold any withholding taxes from any payment under
this Section  8.3.  **** Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) Parent and Merger Sub  agree that  payment of the Termination
Fee, if such payment is payable and actually  paid,  shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub upon  the  termination of this
Agreement in the circumstances described in Sections  8.1(b),  8.1(c) and
8.1(d), and (ii) the Company agrees that payment of the  Parent  Termination
Fee, if such payment is payable and actually paid, shall  be the sole  and
exclusive monetary remedy of the Company upon the termination of  this 
Agreement in the circumstances described in Sections 8.1(b) and 8.1(c). 
Under no  circumstances shall the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination
Fee  be payable  more than once pursuant to this Section 8.3.
