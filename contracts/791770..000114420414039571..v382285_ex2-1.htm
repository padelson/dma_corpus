value (as reasonably determined by the Galaxy Board utilizing the Parent Average Trading Price and the Warrant Value) equal to
the Option Consideration that would have otherwise been payable in respect of such Option under this Section 2.1(b). Each Option
Share shall be treated as an issued and outstanding Galaxy Share for all purposes hereunder, except that the holder of an Option
Share shall not be required hereunder to deliver a Letter of Transmittal or surrender share certificates in respect of such Option
Share prior to receiving any portion of the Closing Date Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Option Share and shall

Consideration which were not granted under the Stock Plan (&ldquo;<U>Non-Compensatory Options</U>&rdquo;) shall be required, as

Option (or an affidavit of loss in form and substance satisfactory to Parent related thereto) and deliver an optionholder release
agreement in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit C</U> (the &ldquo;<U>Optionholder Release Agreement</U>&rdquo;). At or after
the First Effective Time, upon surrender of such document or agreement evidencing a Non-Compensatory Option or its loss by the
holder of such Non-Compensatory Option together with an Optionholder Release Agreement, the holder of such Non-Compensatory Option
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, without interest, the Option Consideration (or, in the event that such surrender
occurs prior to the Closing Date, then at the Closing). The Option Consideration shall be paid to the Option holders in the same
proportion of cash, Parent Shares and Warrants as the Final Per Share Merger Consideration is paid to holders of Galaxy Class A
Common Stock, and the holders of Non-Compensatory Options may elect by written notice to Parent to receive the cash portion of
the Option Consideration either by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds. With respect to any Option Shares, (A)
the cash portion of the Closing Date Class A Per Share Merger Consideration shall be paid, subject to any applicable withholding
Taxes on the deemed exercise with respect to the total value of the Closing Date Class A Per Share Merger Consideration, by the
Final Surviving Company utilizing its payroll system as promptly as practicable, but in any event on the date of payment during
the first full payroll cycle following the First Effective Time and (B) the Parent Shares and Warrant portions of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration shall be delivered on the Closing Date; <U>provided</U>, that if the cash portion of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration paid in respect of an Option Share is less than the amount of Taxes required to be withheld and the holder of such
Option Share does not pay or cause to be paid to Parent in cash the remaining amount of Taxes required to be withheld, Parent shall
withhold from such holder&rsquo;s Closing Date Merger Consideration a number of Parent Shares the value of which (determined by
reference to the Parent Average Trading Price) when combined with the cash portion of the Closing Date Merger Consideration paid
to such holder equals the amount required to be withheld and shall cause the full amount of Taxes required to be withheld to be
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity.</P>

Financing Commitments until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants
applicable to Parent, LLC Sub and Merger Sub in the Financing Commitments at or prior to Closing and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated

a Financing Commitment (or commitment for any alternative financing obtained in accordance with this Section 5.6) and provide to

Fee; Damages Limitation.</B> In the event that Parent shall be obligated to pay the Parent Fee, and without limiting the terms
set forth in the last sentence of this Section 9.5, the payment of the Parent Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and
the sole and exclusive remedy of Galaxy and any other Person in connection with this Agreement against Parent and its former, current
or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, management
companies, members, stockholders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates or assignees and any and all former, current or future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all former, current or future heirs, executors, administrators,

any such Person (each, a &ldquo;<U>Parent Related Party</U>,&rdquo; and collectively, the &ldquo;<U>Parent Related Parties</U>&rdquo;),
and no Parent Related Party shall have any other liability or obligation for any or all Losses suffered or incurred by Galaxy or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither Galaxy nor any other Person shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Parent or any other Parent Related Party arising out of this
Agreement or any Financing Commitment, or any of the transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination. Each of
the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 9.5 are an integral part of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect
to the foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement the right to such payment constitutes a reasonable estimate of the
Losses that will be suffered by reason of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated damages (and not a
penalty). Without limiting the foregoing, but without limitation of the rights of Galaxy in respect of specific performance pursuant
to Section 10.9 and any rights under the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that in the event that this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(h) and the Parent Fee is paid within the two day period specified in Section
9.2(b), then, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and any other Parent Related Party under this Agreement or relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Parent Fee, and in no event shall
Galaxy or any other Person seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Parent
becomes obligated to pay the Parent Fee, Parent shall additionally pay to Galaxy (A) interest on the amount of such Parent Fee
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the per annum rate equal to eight percent (8%)
and (B) if, in order to obtain such payment, Galaxy commences a suit for payment of such Parent Fee that results in a judgment
against Parent, Parent shall reimburse Galaxy for its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with such suit. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the Parent Fee on more than one occasion at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. So long
as this Agreement shall not have been terminated, Galaxy shall be entitled to pursue both a grant of specific performance under
Section&nbsp;10.9 and the payment of the Parent Fee under Section 9.2(b), but under no circumstances shall Galaxy be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance under Section&nbsp;10.9 and payment of the Parent Fee.</P>

parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, except as set forth in the Section 10.9(b), each
of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages
or otherwise, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, <U>provided</U>, that if jurisdiction is not then available in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then in any federal court located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a remedy of
specific performance on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each
party further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section&nbsp;10.9, and each party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement),
the End Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action,
suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding. Notwithstanding
anything set forth herein to the contrary, until such time as Parent pays the Parent Fee at a time specific performance is not
being pursued by Galaxy, the remedies available to Galaxy pursuant to this Section 10.9 shall be in addition to any other remedy
to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict,
impair or otherwise limit Galaxy from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Parent Fee under
Section 9.2.</P>
