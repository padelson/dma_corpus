Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash,
the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof in the form of a check
to be mailed within three (3) Business Days of receipt by the Paying Agent of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificates so surrendered
and Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or due transfer of the Book-Entry Shares. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Until
so surrendered or delivered, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article
IV_.

 

(v) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Common Shares may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or
the Book-Entry Shares so transferred are registered if such
Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and, in each
case, the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect
thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

 

(b) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be marked
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article IV_.

 



18 (c) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and other
eligible Persons in accordance with this _Article IV_ following six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to or as directed by
the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such holder who has not
previously complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable, for
payment of any such holders claim for the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person
of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue the
Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of such
bond shall be deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the relevant
Common Shares for purposes of this _Article IV_.

 

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), or any provision of state, local, provisional, or non-U.S. Applicable Law
relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and then remitted to the relevant
Taxing Authority on behalf of a former holder of Common Shares, RSUs, PSUs or
Stock Appreciation Rights, such withheld and remitted amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder
of the Common Shares, RSUs, PSUs or Stock Appreciation Rights in respect of
which such deduction, withholding and remittance to the relevant Taxing
Authority was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Merger Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. 

(g) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered or transferred, as applicable, in
accordance with this  _Section 4.2_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, subject to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.
Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or the
transfer of any Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full

 



19  satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share and the Common Shares formerly represented thereby.

 

Section 4.3 _Treatment of RSUs, PSUs and Stock Appreciation Rights_.

 

(a) _RSUs_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder
of any Common Shares or RSUs, each RSU (whether vested or unvested) shall be
fully vested and shall be canceled, with the holder of each such RSU becoming
entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_
with respect to such payment) equal to the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of Common Shares subject to such
RSU held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _PSUs_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of
any Common Shares or PSUs, each PSU (whether vested or unvested) shall be
fully vested and shall be canceled, with the holder of each such PSU becoming
entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_
with respect to such payment) equal to the product of (A) the
Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of Common Shares subject to
such PSU held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time
determined by assuming that the applicable performance goals were achieved at
100% of the target level. 

(c) _Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any Common Shares or Stock Appreciation Rights, each
Stock Appreciation Right (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully vested
and shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash (without interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld
in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to such payment) determined
by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price per share of such Stock Appreciation Right by (y)
the number of Common Shares subject to such Stock Appreciation Right (the "
_SAR Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
outstanding no Stock Appreciation Rights and the former holders thereof shall
be entitled only to the payment of the SAR Consideration, if any. Any Stock
Appreciation Right with respect to which the SAR Consideration is $0.00 shall
be cancelled for no consideration.

(d) Unless a later time for payment is expressly provided in this  _Section
4.3_ or is otherwise agreed between Parent and an individual holder, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of RSUs, PSUs and Stock
Appreciation Rights the cash payments described in this _Section 4.3_
promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the fifth
(5th) Business Day after the Effective Time or, if applicable, such later time
as be required under Section 409A of the Code.

 



20 (e) The Company Board (or appropriate committee thereof) shall pass
resolutions and take all other such action as may be reasonably necessary to
effectuate the treatment of RSUs, PSUs and Stock Appreciation Rights as
contemplated by this _Section 4.3_ to the effect that (i) all awards issued
under the Company Incentive Plan shall be settled as of the Effective Time as
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither any holder of any RSU, PSU or
Stock Appreciation Right, nor any other participant in the Company Incentive
Plan, shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or to receive any payment or
benefit with respect to any award previously granted under the Company
Incentive Plan, except as provided in this  _Section 4.3_, and (iii) as of
the Effective Time, each Company Incentive Plan shall be terminated.

 

Section 4.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_, but rather,
the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the
appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld
in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ with respect to such payment (and, at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders
shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , that, if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in
_Section 4.1(a)_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any demands
received by the Company for payment of the fair value of any Common Shares and
shall provide Parent the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, except
as required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 

Section 4.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, at any time
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company, notwithstanding _Section 7.1(e)_, changes (or establishes a record
date for changing) the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding prior to
the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Common Shares,
then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change.

fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof, and
the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of

(a) _Section 5.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of Intellectual Property owned by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries that is registered or subject to pending applications for
registration. " _Company IP_ " means Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is necessary for the conduct of the
businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole as now
being conducted. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own, free of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and other than licenses of
Intellectual Property by the Company to third parties, all Company IP, and
such Intellectual Property rights shall survive unchanged immediately
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

(d) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps,
consistent with generally accepted industry standards and any Applicable
Laws, to protect, maintain and enforce their respective rights in the Company
IP, including taking steps reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the
confidentiality of Company IP the value of which is contingent upon
maintaining the confidentiality thereof. Each current and former officer,
employee of the Company and any Company Subsidiary, as well as any consultant,
independent contractor or service provider that has contributed to
material Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries (any of the foregoing, a " _Contributor_ ")
has executed and delivered to the Company a confidentiality and invention
assignment agreement substantially in the form provided in _Section 5.18(d)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. Except for disclosure pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
authorized the disclosure of any proprietary information that the Company
wishes to remain confidential, nor has any such proprietary information been
disclosed, other than pursuant to a valid and enforceable confidentiality
agreement with respect thereto.

Subsidiary is obligated to pay any royalties or license fees to any third
party in respect of its ownership, use, or license of any Intellectual
Property relating to the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries business as
currently conducted, other than with respect to commercially available off-
the-shelf software licensed pursuant to shrink-wrap, click-wrap or online
licenses.

 

(f) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has implemented reasonable backup,
security and disaster recovery technologies and procedures. To the Knowledge

unauthorized access to any of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
information 

 



41  technology systems, (ii) there has been no unauthorized access to any
customer, employee and other personally identifiable information held by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and (iii) the information and data
processed and/or stored by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection
with the operation of its respective business has not been corrupted or
compromised in any material respect.

 

Section 5.19 _Insurance_. _Section 5.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a complete and correct list of the currently effective insurance
policies, including policies of life, property, fire, workers compensation,
products liability, directors and officers liability and other casualty and
liability insurance, maintained by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries covering the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective employees, properties or assets. All insurance policies of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect and were in
full force and effect during the periods of time such insurance policies are
purported to be in effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
in material breach of or default under, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time, would
constitute such a material breach of or default under, or permit termination
or modification under, any such policy. As of the date of this Agreement, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no insurer issuing any such policy has been
declared insolvent or placed in receivership, conservatorship or liquidation.
As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material claim pending under any
of such policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed
by the underwriters of such policies and there has been no threatened
termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any such
policies. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not entitle any
insurer to terminate or modify the insurance policies or materially increase
the premium. The annual premium currently paid by the Company for directors
and officers liability insurance for its last full fiscal year and the
coverage thereunder, is set forth in _Section 5.19_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. To the Knowledge of the Company, between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be able
to renew its existing insurance policies as and when such policies expire or
obtain comparable coverage from comparable insurers as may be necessary to
continue its business without a significant increase in cost.

Section 5.20 _Customers and Suppliers_.

 

(a) _Section 5.20(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists the five largest

Subsidiaries over the four consecutive fiscal quarter period ended September
30, 2015) (each, a " _Major Customer_ ") and the five largest suppliers of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (determined on the basis of aggregate
purchases made by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries over the four
consecutive fiscal quarter period ended September 30, 2015) (each, a " _Major

written notice from any Major Customer or Major Supplier that it intends to
terminate, not renew, or materially and adversely change the terms of

 



42  (whether related to payment, price or otherwise) its relationship with the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, or has had at any time
since January 1, 2012, a direct contractual agreement with any agency of the
U.S. Government and none of its or their products or technology are
specifically designed for a U.S. Government customer.

contained in _Section 6.8_, the Company has taken all necessary actions to
render inapplicable this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, and,

laws enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Source have committed to contribute the amounts set forth therein to Hong Kong
Dongshan Precision Union Opoelectronic Co., Limited, a subsidiary of Parent

Bank of China, New York Branch (the " _Term Loan Financing Source_ " and,

terms and conditions of which, the lender thereto have committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub, which amounts, together with the cash
balances of Parent, HK Borrower and Merger Sub immediately prior to the

agreements, side letters, or arrangements relating to the Commitment Letters
that would affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the Financing.

of the Commitment Letters or, to the Knowledge of Parent, would (x) make any
of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Commitment
Letters inaccurate in any material respect, (y) result in any of the
conditions in the Commitment Letters not being satisfied or (z) otherwise
result in the Financing not being available. As of the date of

terminate any of the Commitment Letters or not to provide the Financing.
Assuming satisfaction of the conditions in _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.3_,
as of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of closing
to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letters or that the full
amounts committed pursuant to the Commitment Letters will not be available as
of the Closing if the conditions of closing to be satisfied by it contained in

Effect.

ARTICLE VIII

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 8.1 _Access and Information_. Upon reasonable prior notice and subject
to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its
Representatives reasonably access during normal business hours and without
undue disruption of normal business activity during the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement to all of
its books, records, properties, contracts, commitments, premises,
Representatives and the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
make available to Parent all financial, operating and other data and
information as Parent may

 



52  reasonably request; _provided_ that (i) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to provide access to (A) any information
that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would result in the loss of
attorney-client or other privilege with respect to such information (
_provided_ that the Company shall use reasonable efforts to allow such access
or disclosure in a manner that does not result in loss or waiver of such
privilege, including, but not limited to, entering into appropriate common
interest or similar agreements), (B) any information that would result in a
breach of an agreement to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party ( _provided_ that the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain any required consent or waiver of such
counterparty to allow such access or disclose such information, and failing
the receipt of such consent or waiver, to make appropriate substitute
disclosure and/or access arrangements), or (C) any information that, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, would violate any Applicable Law or any
request or requirement of any Governmental Entity, or may cause significant
harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the Merger were not consummated,
(ii) no investigation pursuant to this _Section 8.1_ shall affect any
representations or warranties made herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to conduct, or permit Parent or any
of its Representative to conduct, any environmental investigation or sampling
of soil, air, surface water, building material, groundwater or other
environmental media relating to any Company Real Property, and (iv) in any
event, the parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements to the extent any information cannot be circulated to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 8.1_. Parent agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this _Section 8.1_ for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company and
shall give the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
thereof. Except as otherwise expressly permitted or contemplated by this
Agreement, each party shall continue to abide by the terms of the
Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement between Parent and the Company, dated June 25,
2015 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

Section 8.2 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent a
reasonably complete initial draft of a proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") within twenty-five
(25) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event within
thirty-five (35) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement to be sent to
the holders of Common Shares relating to the meeting of the stockholders of
the Company (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") to be held to consider
adoption of this Agreement, approval of the Merger and approval of any other
matters to affect the transactions contemplated hereby as determined by the
Parties. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall furnish all information
concerning Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy

 



53  Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
filing. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) the receipt of any
comments from the SEC and all other written correspondence and oral
communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement and (ii) any
request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information with respect thereto and, in each case of clauses
(i) and (ii), the Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. All filings by the Company with the SEC
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto and any response to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, shall be subject to the reasonable
prior review and comment of Parent, and all mailings to the stockholders of
the Company in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the reasonable prior review
and comment of Parent and, in each case, the Company shall consider in good
faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall not file
or mail any document relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting or respond
to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

Section 8.3 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance
with its Constituent Documents and Applicable Law (and regardless of whether
there has occurred an Adverse Recommendation Change), as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date on which the staff of the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or that it
does not intend to review the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking
the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ _that_ , the Company may adjourn
or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting as necessary so that such
meeting is convened promptly after the date on which a vote at the
shareholders meeting of UEL has been taken in order to obtain the UEL
Shareholder 

 



54  Approval. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company and to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date on which the staff of the SEC confirms that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement or that it does not intend to review
the Proxy Statement and (ii) subject to  _Section 8.4_, solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend
to its stockholders that they vote their shares in favor of the Merger (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ") and shall include such Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Company
Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
_Section 8.4_. The Company agrees that its obligation to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or by the making of any
Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. Without
limiting the foregoing, if the Company Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change, then the Company Board shall submit this
Agreement to the Companys stockholders without a recommendation (although the
resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement may not
be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Companys stockholders in
the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by Applicable Law. The Company shall not adjourn, postpone or
recess the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent and shall adjourn, postpone or recess such meeting as directed by
Parent in order to obtain a quorum or solicit additional votes (so long as
such meeting is not adjourned, postponed or recessed to a date on or after the
Initial Termination Date). In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall not
submit to the vote of its stockholders any Alternative Transaction Proposal
other than the Merger.

Section 8.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this _Section 8.4_, the
Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate, or
knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including by way of providing
information) any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in an
Alternative Transaction Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-
public information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any Person
(whether or not a Person making an Alternative Transaction Proposal) with
respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry or proposal
that may reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative Transaction
Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend any Alternative Transaction Proposal,
(iv) approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or
other similar agreement related to any Alternative Transaction Proposal (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (v) enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail

 



55  to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations
hereunder. The Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations (if any) with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Alternative Transaction Proposal, which did
not result from any breach of this _Section 8.4_, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors) that such Alternative Transaction
Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, then
the Company may, subject to compliance with _Section 8.4(e)_, prior to (but
not after) the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval: (x) furnish
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Transaction
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , that a copy of all such information not previously
provided to Parent (or its Representatives) (together with a copy of the
Alternative Transaction Proposal) is provided to Parent substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Alternative
Transaction Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding the terms of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall within
24 hours provide Parent with a written summary of the discussions and
negotiations with respect to the Alternative Transaction Proposal.
The Company agrees that neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
terminate, waive, amend, modify or fail to enforce any existing standstill or
confidentiality obligations (if any) owed by any Person to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, in each case, except to the extent necessary to permit
the Company to take an action it is otherwise permitted to take under this
_Section 8.4(a)(x) or (y)_ in full compliance with such provision; _provided_
, that the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Subsidiaries) hereby
waives any such standstill obligation to the extent necessary to permit a
Person otherwise covered by such standstill to submit a confidential
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Alternative Transaction Proposal to the
Company Board. For purposes of clarification, the taking of any of the actions
contemplated by clause (x) or (y) of this _Section 8.4(a)_ shall be deemed
not to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(b) The Company Board shall not, and shall cause each of its committees not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify (or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify), in any such case in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or the approval, adoption, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any committee thereof with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt, approve or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt, approve, or declare
advisable, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (C)

 



56  recommend, adopt, approve, or declare advisable, or propose to recommend,
adopt, approve or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (D) enter into any
agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle requiring the Company
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, (E) subject to _Section 8.4(f)_,
fail to recommend against any Alternative Transaction Proposal within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, (F) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or reaffirm such Company Board Recommendation at the request of
Parent within five (5) Business Days or (ii) resolve or agree to do any of
the foregoing (each being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
").

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company Board may, prior to
(but not after) receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if (i) in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Alternative Transaction Proposal, the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that such
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (ii) an Intervening Event has occurred, and in either
case, following consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board
determines that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change until
after the fifth (5th) Business Day (the " _Recommendation Change Notice
Period_ ") following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Company Notice
of Recommendation Change_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take such action, which notice shall (A) if made in
connection with a Superior Proposal, include the terms and conditions of any
Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company
Board and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, and, if
applicable, a copy of all of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and
any other documents provided by, or correspondence with, the party making
such Superior Proposal, including the then-current form of the definitive
agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal and any related financing
commitments in the Companys possession (or, in each case, if not provided in
writing to the Company, a written summary of the terms thereof) (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Recommendation Change
and trigger a new Recommendation Change Notice Period) and (B) if made in
connection with an Intervening Event, provide reasonable details regarding
such Intervening Event. The Company Board may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior Proposal if any such Superior
Proposal resulted from a material breach by the Company of this _Section
8.4_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any acquisition agreement
pursuant to an Alternative Transaction Proposal unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its

 



57  terms and the Company Termination Fee has been paid in the manner provided
in _Section 10.3(b)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent in response to a Company
Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise; _provided_ , that the Company
shall, and shall cause its outside legal counsel and financial advisor to,
during the Recommendation Change Notice Period and prior to any Adverse
Recommendation Change, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent also seeks to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that (i) in the event of a Company Notice
of Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior Proposal, this Agreement
would result in a transaction that would be no less favorable to the
stockholders of the Company than any Alternative Transaction Proposal that
would be deemed to constitute a Superior Proposal in the absence of such
adjustments or (ii) in the event of a Company Notice of Recommendation Change
in connection with an Intervening Event, such Adverse Recommendation Change
would no longer be necessary to comply with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, and, in each
case as applicable, in the event Parent agrees to make such adjustments to
the Agreement, no Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made.

(e) In addition to the forgoing obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 8.4_, the Company shall, within 24 hours of the receipt thereof,
advise Parent orally of any Alternative Transaction Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of any such Alternative Transaction Proposal (including
any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent informed
in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis (and in no event
later than 24 hours from the occurrence or existence of any material event,
fact or circumstance) of the status and details (including any material change
to the terms thereof) of any Alternative Transaction Proposal, and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged between the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any
of the terms or conditions of any Alternative Transaction Proposal. The
Company shall not, and shall cause Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such information to
Parent and shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of
any discussions or negotiations and of any modifications to such inquiries,
proposals or offers.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under

 



58  Applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such statement that would be an
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be in accordance with _Section 8.4(c)_
and _Section 8.4(d)_.

 

Section 8.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company,
on one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable any necessary
consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of, actions or non-actions by,
and make as promptly as practicable all necessary notifications to and
filings and submissions with, any Governmental Entity pursuant to Applicable
Law or any third party as set forth in _Schedule 8.5_ ; (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to (A) avoid a suit, action, petition to deny,
objection, proceeding or investigation, whether judicial or administrative
and whether brought by a Governmental Entity or any third party, and (B) avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution, lifting or rescinding of, any
injunction, stay, restraining order or other order in any such suit, action,
petition to deny, objection, proceeding or investigation, in each case,
challenging this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or that
would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in
(1) determining which filings or responses to requests for additional
information or documentary material from a Governmental Entity are required to
be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which registrations, consents,
approvals, Permits, notices or authorizations are required to be obtained
prior to the Effective Time from, Governmental Entities or third parties in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and related
agreements and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and (2) timely making all such filings and responses and timely
seeking all such consents, approvals, Permits, notices or authorizations;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not make any such filing or response or
seek any such consent, approval, Permit, notice or authorization without the
prior consent of Parent, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article IX_ to be satisfied as
promptly as reasonably practicable and (v) use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, and
cooperate with each other in order to do, all other things necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as
practicable. At the request of Parent and for the purpose of obtaining the HSR
Antitrust Clearance, PRC Antitrust Clearance, or the CFIUS Approval, the
Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit
to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, _provided_ that the effectiveness or consummation of
such action is conditional on the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, be obligated to
propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any operational restriction,
or take or commit to make payments or enter into any commercial arrangement,
or commit, or commit to take, any action (A) the effectiveness or
consummation of which is not conditional on the consummation of the Merger or
(B)

 



59  that, in the judgement of Parent acting in good faith, individually or in
the aggregate is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse
(with materiality, for purposes of this provision, being measured in relation
to the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) to Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation,
either before or after giving effect to the Merger (a " _Burdensome
Condition_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to the matters covered in this _Section 8.5_, it is agreed that Parent,
after consulting with the Company and considering the Companys views in good
faith, shall make all decisions, lead all discussions, negotiations and
other proceedings, and coordinate all activities with respect to any requests
that may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or
waivers that may be sought by or from, any Governmental Entity, including
determining the strategy and manner in which to contest or otherwise respond,
by litigation or otherwise, to objections to, or proceedings or other actions
challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent shall give the
Company the opportunity to participate in such discussions, negotiations or
other proceedings to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law. Parent shall
have the unilateral right to determine whether or not the parties will
litigate with any Governmental Entity to oppose any enforcement action or
remove any court or regulatory Orders impeding the ability to consummate the
Merger. Subject to _Section 8.5(a)_, at Parents request and sole expense,
the Company agrees to take all actions Parent reasonably deems prudent in
order to obtain or assist Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in obtaining any
actions, consents, undertakings, approvals or waivers by or from any
Governmental Entity or any Person for or in connection with, and to
reasonably assist Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in litigating or otherwise
contesting any objections to or proceedings or other actions challenging, the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall not permit any of its Representatives to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation, proceeding or other matters related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the Company consults with Parent in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives Parent the opportunity to attend
such meeting;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
8.5(b)_ shall obligate the Company to take any action that is not either (i)
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) at the expense of Parent.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the rest of this  _Section 8.5_:

(i) Parent and/or Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable),
on the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates, if applicable), on the
other hand, shall (i) make any required filings with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR
Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a
request for early termination of the waiting period thereunder) as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days from the date of this Agreement, and shall

 



60  thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for
additional information or documentation, (ii) file an initial filing with the
PRC Anti-Monopoly Bureau relating to this Agreement and the transactions

the date of this Agreement, and (B) as soon as reasonably practicable after
CFIUS notification that the draft filing meets all requirements of 31 C.F.R. §

CFIUS a voluntary notice as contemplated by 31 C.F.R. § 800.401(a), (iv)

Approvals as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and (v)

to be made or submitted to any other Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
filings described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) collectively, "
_Regulatory Filings_ "). Any fees and expenses (other than the attorneys,
advisors and agents fees) payable under the Regulatory Filings relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by Parent or the relevant
Subsidiary of Parent.

(ii) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate and coordinate with
the other in the making of Regulatory Filings and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity under
any Applicable Laws or Orders with respect to any such filing, (ii) supply the
other with any information and reasonable assistance that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with the making of such filings, (iii)
supply any additional information that may be required or reasonably requested
by the relevant Governmental Entity and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the HSR Antitrust Clearance and PRC
Antitrust Clearance as soon as practicable, to obtain the PRC Overseas
Investment Approvals as soon as practicable (other than as waived by Parent),
to obtain the CFIUS Approval as soon as practicable, and to avoid any
impediment to the consummation of the Merger under any Applicable Laws or
Orders, including, subject to _Section 8.5(a)_, using reasonable best efforts
to take all such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as any Governmental Entity or Person may assert under any
Applicable Laws or Orders with respect to the Merger.

 

(iii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, promptly inform
the other of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any
Regulatory Filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental
Entity relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information
or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to a
Regulatory Filing, then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to

 



61  make, or cause to be made, within a reasonable time and after consultation
with the other party, an appropriate response to such request. In connection
with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable
and unless prohibited by Applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity (other than any PRC
Governmental Entity) relating to the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in
each of such meetings, (iii) keep the other party reasonably apprised
with respect to any material communications with any Governmental Entity
regarding the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (iv)
cooperate with each other (or counsel of each party, as appropriate) in the
filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
or other written communications explaining or defending the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument and/or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Entity, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views
of the other with respect to, all material written communications (including
applications, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and
opinions) with a Governmental Entity (other than any PRC Governmental Entity)
regarding the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, and (vi)
provide each other (or counsel of each party, as appropriate) with copies of
all material written communications to or from any Governmental Entity
relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby. Any such
disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information by one party
to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under
Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the disclosing party.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing shall be governed
exclusively by _Section 8.15_ and not this _Section 8.5_.

 

Section 8.6 _Public Announcements; Public Disclosures_. Except with respect to
any Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required
by Applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. Parent and the Company agree that the initial press release
to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

Section 8.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Until the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Effective Time (the "
_Benefits Continuation Period_ "), and subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 8.7_ ,

 



62  Parent shall provide, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to provide, for each employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary who continues as an employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries during the Benefits Continuation
Period (each, a " _Company Employee_ "), (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate
and annual cash incentive opportunities (excluding equity, retention bonuses,
change in control bonuses, and similar transaction-based incentives) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) other compensation
and employee benefits (excluding equity incentives) that are competitive in
the aggregate for an employee at the level and seniority of such Company
Employee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, after
the Effective Time, nothing herein shall preclude the Company (and the
Surviving Corporation) from terminating the employment of any Company Employee
for any lawful reason.

 

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under
any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee
after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), the Company
Employees shall receive service credit for service with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (and any respective predecessors) to the same extent such
service credit was granted under the Company Benefit Plans, including with
respect to vacation time, sick time and recognized holidays, but
excluding benefit accrual for all other purposes, _provided_ that no service
credit will result in the duplication of benefits. In addition and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction
of any other eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (x) all pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents and (y)
any expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year ending on the date such
employees participation in the New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for the purpose of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket requirements and similar expenses
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

(c) Nothing in this _Section 8.7_ shall confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing herein shall (i)
amend or be deemed to amend any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) limit in any way
Parents ability to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan at any time.

Section 8.8 _Company Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee or agent may have under any employment or indemnification

 



63  agreement or under the Companys Constituent Documents, this Agreement or,
if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Company Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who was, is at
the date of this Agreement or becomes during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date (A) a director or officer of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, (B) a director, officer or trustee of another
entity (but only to the extent that such person is or was serving in such
capacity at the request of the Company) or (C) an employee or agent of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), in each case, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Applicable
Law without regard to whether indemnification may be available to such
Indemnified Party from another Person, as now or hereafter in effect, in
connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid
in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties
or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any request for advancement,
advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by Applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any expenses
incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise
participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case,
without the requirement of any bond or other security. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section
8.8(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the consideration, approval and adoption thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to a person who continues to be or who has ceased to be (A) a
director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (B) a director,
officer or trustee of another entity (but only to the extent that such person
is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) or (C) an employee or agent of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement, and shall inure to the benefit of
such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. The
Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification has been or
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such Claim and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party, or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents thereto. The Surviving Corporation shall cause its
Constituent Documents and the Constituent Documents of its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director, officer and employee liability that are no less
favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those set forth

 



64  in the Constituent Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Parties. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 8.8_, upon learning of
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Company, and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing; provided, that the failure
promptly to so notify in writing shall not affect the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation except to the extent, if any, that it is not materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid,
non-cancelable policy on the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_"), provided that the Company shall
not pay, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
pay, annual premiums in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the
amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such
two hundred and fifty percent (250%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in 
_Section 5.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter). The Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect. If, for any reason, such "tail policy" cannot be maintained in full
force and effect at any time during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain in effect the DandO Insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by
the DandO Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage, retention and
amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance, and with an
insurance company with the same or better credit rating as the insurance
company providing the current DandO Insurance; provided, however, that in
satisfying its obligations under this _Section 8.8(b)_, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of the Maximum Annual Premium; provided, however, that, if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall take, or allow to be
taken, any action to terminate, or which could reasonably be expected to
result in the termination of, the DandO Insurance.

 

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
8.8_.

 



65 (d) The provisions of this _Section 8.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their respective representatives.

 

Section 8.9 _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to comply with this Agreement, perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, in each case, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments or incur or guarantee any indebtedness or liabilities, other than
as specifically contemplated by this Agreement and the Term Loan Commitment
Letter.

 

Section 8.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or may become applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein including the Merger, the parties and their
respective boards of directors or other governing bodies shall use reasonable
best efforts to (a) take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such
statute or regulation on the Merger.

 

Section 8.11 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and the Company
Subsidiaries operations.

 

Section 8.12 _Section 16_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall use
reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be required, including
the adoption of a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the
SEC, so that the disposition or acquisition of any equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) pursuant to this Agreement by any
officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (" _Section 16_") shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

Section 8.13  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure
to occur would cause (a) any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (b) a material
failure of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations and warranties of any of the parties or the conditions to the
performance by the parties

 



66  hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to comply with this
covenant shall not result in a non-satisfaction of _Article VII_.

 

Section 8.14 _Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any litigation
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or any
litigation by any lender to the Company (or any of the Company Subsidiaries)
or any Person that makes an Alternative Transaction Proposal, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent in its
sole discretion.

 

Section 8.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, on or prior to the Closing Date,
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms set forth
therein. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of material
developments in respect of Parents efforts to arrange the Financing. Prior to
the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent
shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment, modification or supplement of,
or waiver under, the Commitment Letters to the extent such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount to be
funded under the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount of the Financing or similar fees), (ii) amend,
modify or supplement the conditions or contingencies to the Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to make it less likely the Financing
will be funded or imposes new or additional conditions or expands any existing
condition to the receipt of the Financing, or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Parent or its
Subsidiary that is a party to the Commitment Letters may amend the Commitment
Letters to add investors, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letters as of
the date of this Agreement and, in connection therewith, amend the economic
and other arrangements with respect to the existing and additional
investors, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities, if the addition of such additional parties and amendment of
additional terms do not impact the aggregate amount of the Financing to be
funded at the Closing or, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make it less likely the
Financing will be funded, (y) neither this _Section 8.15(a)_ nor any other
provision herein shall be construed to require any of Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates to commence, threaten to commence or
prosecute any claim, at law or in equity, against the other parties to the
Commitment Letters or any other Person in order to consummate the Financing
and (z) in the event that Parent or any of its Affiliates is required pursuant
to this _Section 8.15_ to provide any information that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege, Parent or such Affiliate may withhold
disclosure of such information so long as Parent gives notice to the Company
of the fact that it is withholding such information and thereafter the Company
and Parent shall use their 

 



67  respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided
in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable
privilege or protection.

 

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters and such portion is
necessary to fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources for such portion (x) on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, than the Commitment Letters and (y) in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. If obtained, Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of a new financing
commitment letter pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with any portion of the
Financing. References in this Agreement to (i) "Financing" shall include the
mezzanine financing and term loan financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters as amended, modified or replaced, (ii) "Commitment Letters" shall
include such documents as amended, modified or replaced and (iii) "Financing
Sources" shall include the providers of the Mezzanine Financing and Term Loan
Financing under such documents as amended, modified or replaced (in the case
of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), including replacement with alternative
financing and alternative financing commitments pursuant to this _Section
8.15_ from and after such amendment, modification or replacement); _provided_
, that fee letters or side letters which do not contain "flex" or other
provisions which affect the terms or conditions of the Financing shall not be
required to be provided.

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to provide, such necessary cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested
by Parent, including (i) providing to the Financing Sources such financial
and other information in the Companys possession with respect to the Merger
as may reasonably be required to consummate the Financing, designating a
member of the Companys senior management to be available to assist the
Financing Sources and otherwise reasonably cooperating in connection with the
consummation of the Financing, including participating in a reasonable number
of calls, meetings, presentations, due diligence sessions and sessions with
prospective Financing Sources (including direct contact between such designee
and the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources,
potential lenders for the Financing, on the other hand), in each case in
connection with the Financing, (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable,
furnishing Parent and its or its Subsidiaries Financing Sources and their
respective Representatives with the Required Information and such other
pertinent and customary financial and other information as Parent shall
reasonably request in order to syndicate and consummate the Financing, (iii)
assisting with the preparation of bank information memoranda,
business projections, lender presentations and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing, including execution and delivery of customary
representation letters in connection with bank information memoranda
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders

 



68  and identifying any portion of such information that constitutes material,
nonpublic information regarding the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective securities (which shall only be provided to prospective
lenders pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement), including using
reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in connection with the preparation of
pro forma financial information to the extent reasonably requested by the
Financing Sources to be included in any marketing materials (provided that
Parent will be solely responsible for the provision of any such post-Closing
pro forma financial information, including cost savings, synergies
capitalization, ownership, estimates, forecasts, projections and other
forward-looking financial information), (iv) assisting in the preparation of
and executing and delivering one or more credit agreements, indentures,
purchase agreements, pledge and security documents, mortgages, guarantees and
other definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents as may
reasonably be requested by Parent so long as such documents do not become
effective against the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall (1) be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective Time, (2) have any
liability or obligation under any loan agreement, bank information memoranda
or any related document or any other agreement or document related to the
Financing prior to the Effective Time or (3) be required to incur any
other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time;
(v) obtaining a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters, customary authorization letters to the Financing
Sources and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Financing, (vi) taking all reasonable actions necessary to (y)
assist the prospective lenders involved in the Financing and the Financing
Sources to evaluate the Companys assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes of
establishing collateral arrangements as of the Closing and to assist with
other collateral audits and (z) establish bank and other accounts and blocked
account agreements to the extent necessary in connection with the Financing,
(vii) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or customary to permit the
consummation of the Financing, (viii) providing all documentation and other
information as is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT
Act to the extent reasonably requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, (ix) issuing customary representation letters
to auditors and using reasonable best efforts to obtain, to the extent
necessary, (I) accountants comfort letters and consents to the use of
accountants audit reports relating to the Company, (II) consents, waivers,
appraisals and title insurance as may be reasonably required by any Financing
Source, and (III) customary evidence of authority, customary officers
certificates, good standing certificates (to the extent applicable) in the
respective jurisdictions of organization of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and insurance certificates, in each case as reasonably requested by any
Financing Source, and (x) cooperating reasonably with the Financing Sources
due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable. The Company hereby
consents to the reasonable use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are used in a manner
that is not reasonably likely to harm or

 



69  disparage the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(d) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best
efforts to periodically update any Required Information provided to Parent as
may be necessary so that such Required Information (i) is Compliant and (ii)
meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition of "Required
Information".

 

(e) Notwithstanding the requirements of this _Section 8.15_, nothing herein
will require (i) cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
cooperation or assistance from a Company director, officer or employee to the
extent such Company director, officer or employee is reasonably likely to
incur any personal financial liability by providing such cooperation or
assistance that will not be repaid or reimbursed in full by Parent, (iii)
delivery of any financial information in a form not customarily prepared by
the Company or any financial information with respect to a fiscal period that
has not yet ended, or has ended less than forty-five (45) calendar days prior
to the date of such request (or in the case of annual financials, ninety (90)
calendar days) or delivery of projections, (iv) delivery of any legal opinions
or any certificate as to solvency, or (v) the taking of any action that would
conflict with or violate (A) the Companys certificate of incorporation or
the By-Laws, or result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be
expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any written
agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, license understanding,
instrument, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, option, warranty, insurance
policy, benefit plan or other legally binding commitment to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, in each case that are not contingent
upon the Effective Time or (B) any applicable Laws.

(f) If the Closing does not occur for any reason other than the failure to
satisfy any condition in _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.3_, Parent shall,
promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs to the extent such costs are
incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
such cooperation provided by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives pursuant to the terms of this _Section
8.15(f)_, or in connection with compliance with its obligations under this
_Section 8.15(f)_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against
any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with the Financing and any information utilized

relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any contract executed in
connection herewith, including the Commitment Letters, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (B) neither the Company nor any
other Company Related Party shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim
against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Acquirer Related Party arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement, any contract executed in connection
herewith, including the Commitment Letters, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matters forming the basis for such termination, and (C) the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause any legal proceedings pending in
connection with this Agreement, any contract executed in connection herewith,
including the Commitment Letters, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, to the extent maintained by the Company or another Company
Related Party against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Acquirer Related Party,
to be dismissed with prejudice promptly following the payment of any such
amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Company
be (x) entitled to collect the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion and (y) permitted or entitled to receive both (1) a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief, in each case, with respect to the
obligation to close contemplated by _Section 11.11_ and (2) any money
damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 10.3(e)_, nothing
shall relieve Parent of liability for any material Willful Breach.

(f) In no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek to
enforce (i) this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Financing
Source or any of its former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, assignees or Representatives or (ii) the commitments against, make
any claims for breach of the commitments contained in the Commitment Letters
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the
Financing Sources for any reason, including in connection with the Financing
or the obligations of the Financing Sources thereunder. The Company and
the Company Related Parties hereby waive any and all claims and causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity) against the
Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Financing.

Section 11.3 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The specification of any
dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in _Article V_ or
_Article VI_ is not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, are or are not material for purposes of this Agreement, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or
controversy between or among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires a Company Subsidiary to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Company Subsidiary to take such action and,
after the Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires
Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

 

Section 11.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits, Schedules and other documents and instruments referred to herein)
constitutes

 



83  the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings (other than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
which is hereby incorporated by reference herein), both written and oral,
among the parties or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
including any transaction between or among the parties. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors
and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests
and obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party, in whole or in part
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent
of each of the other parties and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation may assign its rights to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment
shall relieve the Surviving Corporation of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 11.5 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be
interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

(b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_
") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), (ii) waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and (iii) agrees not to
plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has
been brought in any inconvenient forum.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING
WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN

 



84  INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.5_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party hereto hereby
irrevocably agrees (i) that any dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving any Financing Source arising out of or relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby or by any Commitment Letter, including the
related financing shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state
or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, and any
appellate court thereof, (ii) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates
to bring or support any other Person in bringing any such dispute, claim or
controversy of any kind or description in any other court, (iii) that a final
judgment in any such dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or description
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law and (iv) that any such
dispute, claim or controversy of any kind or description shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the
application of the laws of any other State.

 

Section 11.6 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 8.5_,  _Section 8.15(c)_ and _Section 10.3_), whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

Section 11.7 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties, _provided,
however_ , that the provisions of this _Section 11.7_ and _Section 10.3(e)_,
_Section 10.3(f)_, _Section 11.5(a)_, _Section 11.5(c)_,  _Section
11.5(d)_, _Section 11.10(b)_, _Section 11.11(c)_ and _Section 11.12_ and
(including any related definitions used in those sections and any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of such provision would modify the substance of those
sections) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
impacts or is adverse in any material respect to the Company Related
Parties without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

Section 11.8 _Waiver_. Subject to the Financing Sources consent rights in
_Section 11.7_, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties, in the case of Parent, of
the Company and, in the case of the Company, of Parent or Merger Sub, in each
case, contained herein (or in any document delivered pursuant hereto) and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions, in the case of
Parent, of the Company and, in the case of the Company, of Parent or Merger
Sub, in each case, contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall act as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof

 



85  preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder.

 

Section 11.9 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party shall have received counterparts
thereof signed and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail of a.pdf attachment or
otherwise) by all of the other parties.

Section 11.10 _Severability; Validity; Parties in Interest_.

(a) If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any
Person or circumstance is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any rule
of law or public policy, the remainder of this Agreement and the application
of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby, and, to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be
severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. The
parties intend that the remedies and limitations hereon contained in this
Agreement be construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such
remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a
partys liability or obligation hereunder or under the Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Except (i) as provided in _Section 8.8_, (ii) for the provisions of
_Article IV_ and (iii) for the provisions of the last sentence of _Section
8.15(c)_ which shall be for the benefit of the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, except that
(y) the Financing Sources are made third party beneficiaries to _Section
10.3(e)_, _Section 10.3(f)_, this _Section 11.10(b)_, _Section 11.5(a)_,
_Section 11.5(c)_, _Section 11.5(d)_, _Section 11.11(c) _and  _Section
11.12_, and (z) the Non-Recourse Parties are made third party beneficiaries to
this _Section 11.10(b)_, _Section 11.5_ and _Section 11.12_.

 

Section 11.11 _Enforcement of Agreement_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 10.3(b)_, _Section 10.3(c)_, _Section
10.3(d)_   _Section 10.3(e)_ and _Section 10.3(f)_ and subject to _Section
11.5_, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



86 (b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to in  _Section 11.5_, without proof of actual damages (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to seek or obtain any
injunction, specific performance or any other equitable relief requiring
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement, if and only if: (i) all conditions in _Section 9.1_ and _Section
9.3_ have been satisfied or waived as of the date on which the Closing would
otherwise be required to occur (other than those conditions that, by their
nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such conditions would
have been satisfied as of such date)), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Merger by the date the Closing would otherwise be required to
have occurred, (iii) the Financing has been funded or would be funded to HK
Borrower and Merger Sub at the Closing (or, if the Financing has been funded
into escrow, such funds have been or will be released from escrow at the
Closing) if the Closing were to occur and (iv) the Company has irrevocably
committed in writing that the Company is prepared to and able to effect the
Closing upon the funding of the Financing. The election of the Company to
pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit the Company from subsequently seeking to terminate this
Agreement and seeking to collect the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 10.3(c)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to this  _Section 11.11_ and the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee.

Section 11.12 _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities or cause
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement) may be made only against (and are those solely of)
the entities that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement in
the Preamble to this Agreement. No other Person, including any director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
affiliate, agent, attorney 

 



87  or representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to, any party to
this Agreement or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney or representative
of, or any financial advisor, Financing Source or lender to any of the
foregoing (" _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any liabilities (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any
claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in
connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance or breach.

Section 11.13 _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without
notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.
