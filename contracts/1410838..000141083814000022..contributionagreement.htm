This Contribution Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
April 28, 2014, by and among Kinder Morgan, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("KMI"), El Paso Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("El Paso"),
El Paso CNG Company, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("EP CNG"),

referred to herein collectively as the "Parties."

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, El Paso desires to contribute (the "Southern Gulf Contribution") to

the outstanding equity interests in Southern Gulf LNG Company, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company ("Southern Gulf");

WHEREAS, EP CNG desires to contribute (the "CGSC Contribution") to the

Company, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("Ruby Holding");

WHEREAS, the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of the General
Partner, which is the sole general partner of the Partnership (the "Conflicts
Committee"), has (i) received an opinion of Tudor Pickering Holt and Co.
Securities, Inc. ("Tudor Pickering"), the financial advisor to the Conflicts
Committee, that the Total Consideration is fair to unaffiliated common
unitholders of the Partnership from a financial point of view, (ii) found the
Transaction to be fair and reasonable to the Partnership and (iii) recommended
that the Board of Directors of the General Partner approve the Transaction;
and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of KMI (the "KMI Board") has received an
opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("J.P. Morgan"), the financial advisor
to the KMI Board with respect to the Transaction, in form and substance
acceptable to the KMI Board.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions contained
herein, the Parties agree as follows: 



ARTICLE I

CONTRIBUTION



1.1 Contribution. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing:

(a) KMI will cause (i) El Paso to contribute, assign, transfer and convey to
the Partnership 100% of the outstanding membership interests in Southern Gulf
(the "Southern Gulf Interests"), (ii) EP CNG to contribute, assign, transfer
and convey to the Partnership 100% of the outstanding membership interests in
CGSC (the "CGSC Interests"), and (iii) EP Ruby to contribute, assign, transfer
and convey to the Partnership 700,001,000 Class B Common Units in Ruby Holding
(the "Ruby Holding Interests" and, together with the Southern Gulf Interests
and the CGSC Interests, the "Equity Interests"), in exchange for (1) a cash
distribution by the Partnership of $874,800,000.00 (the "Cash Consideration"),
and (2) the issuance to KMI (or its designee) of 3,059,924 common units
representing limited partner interests in the Partnership ("Common Units"),
which number of Common Units represents $97,200,000.00 divided by the
Reference Price determined in accordance with Section 1.1(c) (the "Newly
Issued Common Units"; the Newly Issued Common Units and the Cash Consideration
being referred to herein collectively as the "Total Consideration"). The
Equity Interests shall be transferred to the Partnership at the Closing free
and clear of Liens (other than any Liens created by the Partnership).

(b) Immediately thereafter, the Partnership will contribute, assign, transfer
and convey the Equity Interests to the Operating Company.

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Reference Price" shall mean the
average of the closing price of the Common Units on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") for the twenty (20) trading day period ending two (2)
trading days prior to the date hereof, as reported in Bloomberg Financial
Markets, or, if not reported therein, as reported by Dow Jones. The Reference
Price shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent.

(d) The Total Consideration shall be allocated among the Equity Interests set
forth on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Statement of Allocation").

(e) Concurrently with the issuance of any Common Units in connection with the
Total Consideration, (i) KMI shall cause the General Partner to contribute to
the Partnership an amount in cash equal to 2/98ths of the aggregate value of
the Newly Issued Common Units (approximately $2,072,006) (the "GP Cash
Contribution") and the capital account of the General Partner that is
maintained by the Partnership shall be increased by an amount equal to the GP
Cash Contribution and (ii) the Partnership shall issue to the General Partner
a number of General Partner Units (as defined in the Partnership Agreement)
equal to 2/98ths of the aggregate number of Newly Issued Common Units issued
by the Partnership in connection with the Transaction. 

1.2 Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, KMI shall prepare and
deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the Partnership a statement
(the "Working Capital Statement"), which shall set forth KMI's calculation of
the Working Capital Amount as of the close of business on April 30, 2014 (the
"Effective Time"). For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Working Capital" means
the difference between the current assets reflected on Exhibit B as "Working
Capital Assets" and the current liabilities reflected on Exhibit B as "Working
Capital Liabilities" in each case utilizing only the line items set forth on
Exhibit B, and utilizing the methodologies used in the determination of
Working Capital set forth on Exhibit B; (ii) the "Working Capital Amount"
means the aggregate of (A) an amount equal to the Working Capital of Southern
Gulf as of the Effective Time plus, without duplication, 50% of the
consolidated Working Capital of Gulf LNG Holdings Group, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("Gulf Holdings"), and its subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time, (B) an amount equal to 100% of the consolidated Working
Capital of CGSC as of the Effective Time plus, without duplication, 47.5% of
the Working Capital of Young Gas Storage Company, Ltd., a Colorado limited
partnership ("Young"), as of the Effective Time, and (C) an amount equal to
100% of the consolidated Working Capital of Ruby Holding and its subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time; and (iii) "Working Capital Target" means
($37,000,000).

(b) Within sixty (60) days following receipt by the Partnership of the Working
Capital Statement, the Partnership shall deliver written notice to KMI of any
dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of the Working
Capital Statement, including a reasonably detailed description of the basis
for each disputed item. In the event the Partnership does not notify KMI of a
dispute with respect to the Working Capital Statement within such sixty (60)
day period, such Working Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. In the event of such notification of a dispute, the
Partnership and KMI shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If
KMI and the Partnership notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to
resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the Partnership advises KMI
of its objections, then KMI and the Partnership jointly shall engage the firm
of Deloitte, LLP, or such other public accounting firm to which the Parties
may agree (the "Accounting Firm"), to resolve such dispute. KMI, on the one
hand, and the Partnership, on the other hand, shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as they may deem necessary or
appropriate or as the Accounting Firm may request and that are available to
that Party or its agents. Following the Accounting Firm's final determination
of the Working Capital Amount, the Accounting Firm shall, within two (2)
business days from the date of such final determination, deliver a written
notice to KMI and the Partnership specifying the Working Capital Amount. All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. KMI, on the one hand, and the Partnership, on the
other hand, shall share equally the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm.

interbank transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by KMI, an amount in cash equal to the amount by which the Working
Capital Amount exceeds the Working Capital Target, such payment to be made

shall, within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, pay to the
Partnership, by wire or interbank transfer of immediately available funds to
an account specified in writing by the Partnership, an amount in cash equal to
the Distribution Amount minus the Capital Contribution Amount. If the

Cash Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately and the Partnership shall,
within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, pay to KMI, by wire or
interbank transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in
writing by KMI, an amount in cash equal to the Capital Contribution Amount

calculation of the Working Capital Amount.

1.4 Tax Characterization. Prior to the Closing, the Partnership shall borrow
funds under its existing Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility Borrowing") and
consummate the Partnership Debt Financings. The aggregate net proceeds of the
Credit Facility Borrowing and the Partnership Debt Financings shall be used to
fund all or a portion of the Cash Consideration. KMI, the General Partner and
the Partnership will enter into indemnity agreements substantially in the
forms attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "KMI Debt Indemnities") the effect of
which will be that KMI will indemnify the General Partner, the Partnership and

operation of law or otherwise with respect to the Partnership Debt Financing
and 50% of the Existing Indebtedness and any indebtedness incurred for
purposes of refinancing all or any portion of the Partnership Debt Financing
and 50% of the Existing Indebtedness. The Parties intend that (a) the 

Cash Consideration shall be made first out of the proceeds of the Partnership
Debt Financing and such portion of the Cash Consideration shall qualify as a
"debt-financed transfer" under Section 1.707-5(b) of the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code (the "Treasury Regulations"); (b) the entire amount
of the Partnership Debt Financing is allocable to, and shall be allocated to
KMI under Sections 1.752-2 and 1.707-5(b) of the Treasury Regulations; and (c)
the distribution of the Cash Consideration in excess of the amounts
distributed out of the proceeds of the Partnership Debt Financing shall be
made to reimburse the Contributors for capital expenditures described in
Section 1.707-4(d) of the Treasury Regulations to the extent such
consideration does not exceed the amount of capital expenditures described in
Section 1.707-4(d) of the Treasury Regulations. Unless otherwise required by a
final determination of the Internal Revenue Service, the Parties agree to act
at all times in a manner consistent with this intended treatment, including
disclosure in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.707-3(c)(2) of the
Treasury Regulations. The "Credit Facility" shall refer to the Credit
Agreement dated May 27, 2011, among Operating Company and Wyoming Interstate
Company, L.L.C., as borrowers, the Partnership, as parent guarantor, and the
lenders and agents identified therein. The "Partnership Debt Financings" shall
refer to one or more offerings and sales (either public or private) of senior
notes or other debt securities of the Partnership. The "Existing Indebtedness"
shall refer to (i) each series of outstanding senior notes of Ruby Pipeline,
L.L.C. ("Ruby Pipeline"), (ii) amounts owed under the Revolving Credit
Agreement dated as of February 15, 2012, among Ruby Pipeline and the lenders

registration and similar taxes and fees arising from or associated with the
transactions contemplated hereunder other than taxes based on income
("Transaction Taxes"), shall be borne 50% by the Contributors and 50% by the
Partnership. To the extent under applicable law the transferee is responsible
for filing tax returns in respect of Transaction Taxes, the Partnership shall
prepare and file all such returns. The Parties shall provide such certificates
and other information and otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably
required to minimize Transaction Taxes. The tax make-whole payment to be made
by Southern Gulf pursuant to the terms of the Mutual Consent Letter dated
September 23, 2013, among Southern Gulf, EFS LNG Holdings, LLC, ARC LNG

financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and KMI
and the Contributors believe that the internal controls over financial
reporting are effective.

3.9 No Adverse Changes. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9 and for changes in

most recent Balance Sheets or reflected in the Working Capital Amount. Each
Company has good and marketable title to its accounts receivable, free and
clear of all Liens, except as set forth in Schedule 3.24. Schedule 3.24 sets
forth, by customer name and account, all receivables of the Companies which

liability, and other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such
deductibles, and against such risks and losses as are, in KMI's and the
Contributors' judgment, reasonable for the business and assets of the
Companies. The insurance policies maintained with respect to the Companies and
their assets and properties owned and maintained by the Companies are listed
on Schedule 3.25. All such policies are, and after the Closing will continue,
in full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid,
and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to
any such policy that has not been replaced on substantially similar terms
prior to the date of such cancellation. No written notice of cancellation of,
or written notice of an intention not to renew, any such insurance policy has
been received by either KMI or the Contributors other than in the ordinary
course of business. To the knowledge of KMI and the Contributors, the
activities and operations of the Companies have been conducted in a manner so
as to conform in all material respects to all applicable provisions of such
insurance policies.

elsewhere in this Agreement shall require any Party to hold separate or make
any divestiture of any asset or otherwise agree to, and no consents or
approvals or other clearances shall be deemed to be obtained for purposes of

restriction on their operations or other materially burdensome condition which

respective subsidiaries in order to obtain any consent or approval or other
clearance required by this Agreement; provided, further, that it being

including the addition of new schedules hereto. Any such update or amendment
will not diminish the Partnership's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(c) and will not be deemed to cure any breaches of
representations or warranties for purposes of determining the satisfaction of
the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a), and no such update or amendment
will in any way diminish the right or ability of the Partnership or any other
Partnership Party to bring a claim or otherwise seek recourse against KMI or
the Contributors, under ARTICLE X of this Agreement or otherwise, for any
breach by KMI or the Contributors of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or condition of this Agreement.

Transferee to agree to take and hold such Newly Issued Common Units or

for no additional or reduced consideration, and to do or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
effect the appropriate assignment or transfer of any such assets identified by
the Parties after the date hereof notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement; provided, however, that if either KMI, on the one hand, or the
Partnership, on the other, determines that any such assignment or asset shall
materially and adversely affect the transaction and consideration contemplated
by this Agreement and exchanged at Closing, all Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to effect an agreement with respect to any appropriate reallocation
of consideration. Schedule 5.9 sets forth a list as of the date of this
Agreement of the assets of the Companies that may be affected by this Section
5.9.

affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, or being a party to any
agreement or arrangement whereby liability for payment of such amounts was
determined or taken into account with reference to the liability of any other
Person;

(iv) "Tax Losses" means Taxes, together with any costs, expenses, losses or
damages, including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys\' and
accountants\' fees and expenses, arising out of or incident to the
determination, assessment or collection of Taxes;

(v) "Tax Returns" means all reports, estimates, declarations of estimated Tax,
information statements and returns relating to, or required to be filed in
connection with, any Taxes; and

(vi) "Taxing Authority" means, with respect to any Tax, the governmental body,
entity or political subdivision thereof that imposes such Tax.

(b) KMI shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold the Partnership,
harmless from any Tax Losses (i) imposed on or incurred by the Companies with
respect to any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to (x) the
Closing Date with respect to Income Taxes (the "Pre-Closing Date Period") and
(y) the Effective Time with respect to Non-Income Taxes (the "Pre-Effective
Time Period"), or (ii) attributable to a breach by KMI or the Contributors of
the representations and warranties in Section 3.11 or any covenant with
respect to Taxes in this Agreement; provided that, with respect to Tax Losses
related to any Company, KMI shall be obligated to indemnify the Partnership
only to the extent of the percentage equity interest in such Company 

owned beneficially by a Contributor immediately prior to Closing; and provided
further that, KMI's obligations pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall be
reduced by the amount of any Taxes that are included in Working Capital
Liabilities.

(c) The Partnership shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold the
Contributors, KMI and their respective affiliates harmless from any Tax Losses
(i) imposed on or incurred by the Companies with respect to any tax period (or

Taxes or (y) the Effective Time with respect to Non-Income Taxes, or (ii)
attributable to a breach by the Partnership of any covenant with respect to
Taxes in this Agreement.

(d) Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this ARTICLE VII to determine the
portion of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by the Companies for a taxable
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date or the Effective
Time, as applicable, which is allocable to the Pre-Closing Date Period or the
Pre-Effective Time Period, as applicable, the determination shall be made, in
the case of property or ad valorem taxes or franchise taxes (which are
measured by, or based solely upon capital, debt or a combination of capital
and debt), on a per diem basis and, in the case of other Taxes, by assuming
that the Pre-Closing Date Period or the Pre-Effective Time Period, as
applicable, constitutes a separate taxable period of the Companies and by
taking into account the events occurring during such period (except that
exemptions, allowances and deductions for a taxable period beginning before
and ending after the Closing Date or the Effective Time, as applicable, that
are calculated on an annual or periodic basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Date Period or the Pre-
Effective Time Period, as applicable, ratably on a per diem basis).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise Tax paid or
payable with respect to the Companies shall be allocated to the taxable period
during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of
such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for
another taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax.

(e) The Partnership agrees to pay to KMI any refund received after the Closing
Date by the Partnership or its affiliates (for purposes of this Agreement, the
Partnership's affiliates shall not include KMI, the Contributors or their
affiliates other than the Partnership Entities), including the Companies, in
respect of any Taxes for which KMI is liable under clause (b) of this Section
7.1. KMI agrees to pay to the Partnership any refund received by KMI or its
affiliates in respect of any Taxes for which the Partnership is liable under
clause (c) of this Section 7.1. The Parties shall cooperate in order to take
all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any such refund received by a
Party or its affiliate for the account of the other Party shall be paid to
such other Party within ten (10) days after such refund is received.

7.2 Tax Returns.

(a) KMI shall cause to be included in the pertinent federal income Tax Return
(and the pertinent state income Tax Returns) for all periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, all Tax Items of the Companies which are required to
be included therein, shall cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed with the
appropriate Taxing Authorities, and shall be responsible for the timely
payment (and entitled to any refund) of all Taxes due with respect to the
periods covered by 

such Tax Returns. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Items" means all items
of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit.

(b) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date that is required to be filed after the Closing Date
with respect to the Companies that is not described in paragraph (a) above,
KMI shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in
such Tax Return all Tax Items required to be included therein, shall furnish a
copy of such Tax Return to the Partnership, shall cause such Tax Return to be
filed timely with the appropriate Taxing Authority, and shall be responsible
for the timely payment (and entitled to any refund) of all Taxes due with
respect to the period covered by such Tax Return.

(c) With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period beginning on or
before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date that is required to
be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the Companies, the Partnership
shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in such
Tax Return all Tax Items required to be included therein, shall furnish a copy
of such Tax Return to KMI, shall file timely such Tax Return with the
appropriate Taxing Authority, and shall be responsible for the timely payment
of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return. The
Partnership shall determine, in accordance with the provisions of Section
7.1(d) of the Agreement, the amount of Tax due with respect to the Pre-Closing
Date Period or the Pre-Effective Time Period, as applicable ("KMI's Tax
Obligation") and shall notify KMI of its determination of KMI's Tax
Obligation. KMI shall pay to the Partnership an amount equal to KMI's Tax
Obligation not later than five (5) days after the filing of such Tax Return.
Any refund attributable to Tax Returns filed pursuant to this Section 7.2(c)
shall be apportioned between the Partnership and KMI in a manner consistent
with calculation of KMI's Tax Obligation.

(d) The Partnership shall, with respect to any Tax Return for which the
Partnership is responsible under Section 7.2(c) for preparing and filing, make
such Tax work papers available for review by KMI if the Tax Return is with
respect to Taxes for which KMI may be liable (in whole or in part) hereunder
or under applicable law. The Partnership shall make such work papers available
for review sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such Tax Returns
to provide KMI with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such
Tax Returns and have such Tax Returns modified before filing, accepting the
position of the Partnership unless such position is contrary to the provisions
of Section 7.2(e) hereof.

(e) Any Tax Return which includes or is based on the operations, ownership,
assets or activities of the Companies for any taxable period beginning before
and ending after the Closing Date, and any Tax Return in respect of any Taxes
for which KMI may be liable (in whole or in part) hereunder shall be prepared
in accordance with past Tax accounting practices used with respect to the Tax
Returns in question (unless such past practices are no longer permissible
under the applicable law), and to the extent any items are not covered by past
practices (or in the event such past practices are no longer permissible under
the applicable tax law), in accordance with reasonable tax accounting
practices selected by the filing party with respect to such Tax Return under
this Agreement with the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
of the non-filing party. 

(f) Unless required by law, the Partnership shall not file an amended Tax
Return for any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the
consent of KMI (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

7.3 Tax Proceedings. In the event the Partnership or any of its affiliates
receives notice (the "Proceeding Notice") of any examination, claim,
adjustment, or other proceeding with respect to the liability of the Companies
for Taxes for any period for which KMI is or may be liable under Section 7.1,
the Partnership shall notify KMI in writing thereof (the "Partnership Notice")
no later than the earlier of (a) thirty (30) days after the receipt by the
Partnership or any of its affiliates of the Proceeding Notice or (b) ten (10)
days prior to the deadline for responding to the Proceeding Notice. Such
Partnership Notice shall contain factual information describing any asserted
liability for Taxes in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of
any notice or other documents received from any Taxing Authority with respect
to such matter. As to any such Taxes for which KMI is or may be liable under
Section 7.1, KMI shall be entitled at its expense to control or settle the
contest of such examination, claim, adjustment, or other proceeding, provided
(i) KMI notifies the Partnership in writing that it desires to do so no later
than the earlier of (1) thirty (30) days after receipt of the Partnership
Notice or (2) five (5) days prior to the deadline for responding to the
Proceeding Notice, and (ii) KMI may not, without the consent of the
Partnership (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), agree to any
settlement which would result in an increase in the amount of Taxes for which
the Partnership or the Companies is or may be liable under Section 7.1. KMI
shall be required to pay any Taxes required to be paid in connection with any
examination, claim, adjustment or other proceeding, including, without
limitation, any prepayment of Tax required to obtain the jurisdiction of a
court. The Parties shall cooperate with each other and with their respective
affiliates, and shall consult with each other, in the negotiation and
settlement of any proceeding described in this Section 7.3. The Partnership
will provide, or cause to be provided, to KMI necessary authorizations,
including powers of attorney, to control any proceedings which KMI is entitled
to control pursuant to this Section 7.3. KMI shall pay to the Partnership the
amount of any Tax Losses the Partnership may become entitled to by reason of
the provisions of this Article VII within fifteen (15) days after the extent
of any Tax liability has been determined by a final judgment or decree of a
Court or a final and binding settlement with a Taxing Authority having
jurisdiction thereof.

7.4 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Partnership and KMI shall
cooperate fully, and shall cause the Companies to cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this ARTICLE VII and any proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Party\'s request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. KMI and the Partnership agree to retain all
books and records in their possession or in the possession of their respective
affiliates with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the earlier of six
years after the Closing Date or the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and thereafter,
upon request, allow the Partnership to take possession of such books and
records. KMI further agrees, upon request, 

to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Taxing Authority or any other person or entity as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Partnership
or the Companies. The Partnership and KMI further agree, upon request, to
provide the other Party with all information regarding the Companies that
either Party may be required to report to any Taxing Authority. Any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting any audit or other proceeding.
Each such Party shall provide the cooperation and information required by this
Section 7.4 at its own expense.

7.5 Survival. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, rights and obligations of
the Parties with respect to any Tax matter covered by this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall terminate ninety (90) days after the expiration
of the statute of limitations (including extensions) applicable to such Tax
matter except to the extent that the person who is entitled to indemnity
payments hereunder by reason of any breach thereof has prior to that time
provided written notice to any person who would be required to make such an
indemnity payment of the breach thereof.

7.6 Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
ARTICLE VII and any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this
ARTICLE VII shall control.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION



8.1 Events of Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Partnership and KMI;

(b) by either the Partnership or KMI in writing after June 30, 2014 (the
"Outside Date") if the Closing has not occurred by such date and, as of such
date, the terminating Party and its affiliates are not otherwise in material
default or breach of this Agreement, or have not failed or refused to close
without justification hereunder;

(c) by either the Partnership or KMI in writing without prejudice to other
rights and remedies which the terminating Party or its affiliates may have
(provided the terminating Party and its affiliates are not otherwise in
material default or breach of this Agreement, or have not failed or refused to
close without justification hereunder), if such other Party or its affiliates
shall (i) materially fail to perform its covenants or agreements contained
herein required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii)
materially breached or have materially breached any of its representations or
warranties contained herein; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i)
or (ii), the defaulting Party shall have a period of ten (10) days following
written notice from the nondefaulting Party to cure any breach of this
Agreement, if such breach is curable;

(d) by either the Partnership or KMI in writing, without liability, if there
shall be any order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority
binding on any Partnership 

Party or the Contributors, which prohibits or restrains the Partnership or the
Contributors from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, provided
that the Partnership and the Contributors shall have used their reasonable
best efforts to have any such order, writ, injunction or decree lifted and the
same shall not have been lifted within 30 days after entry by any such
Governmental Authority;

(e) by KMI if any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 shall have become
incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by KMI; or

(f) by the Partnership if any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 shall
have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by the
Partnership.

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
by a Party, as provided in Section 8.1 above, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void except for this Section 8.2, Section 11.1 and Section 11.3 hereof.
Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to release either Party from any
liability for any willful, material breach by such Party of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of either Party to compel
specific performance by the other Party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

INVESTIGATION; LIMITATIONS



9.1 Independent Investigation. The Partnership acknowledges that in making the
decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, it has relied solely on its own independent investigation
of the Companies, and upon the express written representations, warranties and
covenants in this Agreement. Without diminishing the scope of the express
written representations, warranties and covenants of the Parties in this
Agreement and without affecting or impairing its right to rely thereon, THE
PARTNERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER KMI NOR THE CONTRIBUTORS HAVE MADE, AND
KMI AND THE CONTRIBUTORS HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND NEGATE, ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE ASSETS AND
OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANIES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED OR
EXPRESS WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS).

Contributors on or before the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 3.12, 3.15 and 3.20 shall be limited to claims for which
the Partnership delivers written notice to the Contributors on or before the
second anniversary date of the Closing Date, (ii) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.11 shall not be subject to this Section 9.2
but rather shall be governed by Section 7.5, and (iii) the representations and
warranties set forth in 

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5(a), 3.26, 3.27 and 3.31 shall not be limited

ARTICLE X

INDEMNIFICATION



10.1 Indemnification of KMI and the Contributors. Solely for the purpose of
indemnification in this Section 10.1, the representations and warranties of
the Partnership in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without
regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. The
Partnership, from and after the Closing Date, shall indemnify and hold KMI and
the Contributors and their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives and insurers (collectively, the "Contributor Parties")
harmless from and against any and all damages (including exemplary damages and
penalties), losses, deficiencies, costs, expenses, obligations, fines,
expenditures, claims and liabilities, including reasonable counsel fees and
reasonable expenses of investigation, defending and prosecuting litigation
(collectively, the "Damages"), suffered by the Contributor Parties as a result
of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) subject to
Section 9.2 and Section 10.8, any breach of a representation or warranty of
the Partnership Parties in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
hereunder, (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant in this Agreement on
the part of the Partnership Parties, and (c) any liability or obligation
resulting from any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, by any third party against any Contributor Party that pertains to
the business or operations of the Companies or the ownership of the Equity
Interests, except in the case of this clause (c), to the extent arising out of
the breach by KMI or the Contributors of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of KMI and the Contributors set forth in this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 10.1 shall apply to any liability with
respect to Taxes, for which liability the sole remedy under this Agreement
shall be as set forth in ARTICLE VII.

10.2 Indemnification of the Partnership. Solely for the purpose of
indemnification in this Section 10.2, the representations and warranties of
KMI and the Contributors in this Agreement, other than Section 3.9, shall be
deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifiers. KMI, from and after the Closing, shall indemnify and hold
the Partnership and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives and insurers (together with the Partnership, the "Partnership
Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered
by the Partnership Indemnified Parties as a result of, caused by, arising out
of, or in any way relating to (a) subject to Section 9.2 and Section 10.8, any
breach of a 

representation or warranty of KMI or the Contributors in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered hereunder, and (b) any breach of any agreement or
covenant in this Agreement on the part of KMI or the Contributors under this
Agreement; provided that, with respect to Damages incurred by any Company, KMI
shall be obligated to indemnify such Partnership Indemnified Party only for
such Damages in an amount equal to the percentage equity interests in such
Company owned, directly or indirectly, by the Contributors immediately prior
to the Closing, as set forth on Schedule 10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.2
shall apply to any liability with respect to Taxes, the sole remedy under this
Agreement for which liability shall be as set forth in ARTICLE VII.

10.3 Demands. Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its
discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions
of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion,
claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such
third party actions being collectively referred to herein as the "Indemnity
Claim"), with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to
indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice
thereof in writing to the indemnifying party, together with a statement of
such information respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have. Such notice
shall include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement. If the
indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in sufficient time to permit
the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend against such matter and to
make a timely response thereto including, without limitation, any responsive
motion or answer to a complaint, petition, notice or other legal, equitable or
administrative process relating to the Indemnity Claim, the indemnifying
party's indemnity obligation relating to such Indemnity Claim shall be limited
to the extent that such knowing failure to notify the indemnifying party has
actually resulted in material prejudice or damage to the indemnifying party.

10.4 Right to Contest and Defend. The indemnifying party shall be entitled at
its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate legal
proceedings any Indemnity Claim with respect to which it is called upon to
indemnify the indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement;
provided, that notice of the intention to so contest shall be delivered by the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party within 20 days from the date of
receipt by the indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified party of the
assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the
name and on behalf of the indemnifying party or the indemnified party as may
be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted and prosecuted diligently to a
final conclusion or settled in accordance with this Section 10.4 by reputable
counsel employed by the indemnifying party and not reasonably objected to by
the indemnified party, but the indemnified party shall have the right but not
the obligation to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by
counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense. The indemnifying
party shall have full authority to determine all action to be taken with
respect thereto; provided, however, that the indemnifying party will not have
the authority to subject the indemnified party to any obligation whatsoever,
other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not
involving material expense. If the indemnifying party does not elect to
contest any such Indemnity Claim or elects to contest such Indemnity Claim but
fails diligently and promptly to prosecute or settle such claim, the
indemnified party shall assume the defense of the Indemnity Claim and the
indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto
by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall have assumed the
defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any
settlement, 

compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party may
recommend and that by its terms (a) obligates the indemnifying party to pay
the full amount of the liability in connection with such Indemnity Claim, (b)
releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such Indemnity
Claim and (c) would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in
defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the
portion relating to money damages.

10.5 Cooperation. If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in
contesting any Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest
or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting
the Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim.

10.6 Right to Participate. The indemnified party agrees to afford the
indemnifying party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at, and to
participate in, conferences with all persons, including Governmental
Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim against the indemnified party or
conferences with representatives of or counsel for such persons.

10.7 Payment of Damages. The indemnification required hereunder shall be made
by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense, within ten (10) days following the date of delivery
of reasonably specific bills or the date Damages are incurred and reasonable
evidence thereof is delivered. In calculating any amount to be paid by an
indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of this Agreement, the amount
shall be reduced by an amount equal to any insurance proceeds actually
received by the indemnified party related to the Damages, less any related
costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any related
insurance claims and any related chargebacks (it being agreed that no Party
shall have any obligation to seek to recover any insurance proceeds and that,
promptly after the realization of any insurance proceeds, the indemnified
party shall reimburse the indemnifying party for such reduction in Damages for
which the indemnified party was indemnified prior to the realization of
reduction of such Damages).

10.8 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) To the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 10.2(a), KMI shall not be
liable for such Damages 

unless the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds 1% of the Total
Consideration (the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent of any such
excess.

(b) In addition, to the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 10.2(a), KMI shall
not be liable for Damages that exceed, in the aggregate, 15% of the Total
Consideration (the "Indemnification Limit").

(c) Notwithstanding Sections 10.8(a) and 10.8(b) above, to the extent the
Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for Damages
(i) pursuant to Section 10.2(a) as it relates solely to Sections 3.1, 3.2,
3.3, 3.4, 3.5(a), 3.26, 3.27 and 3.31 or (ii) pursuant to Section 10.2(a) for
claims arising from actual fraud, the Contributors shall be fully liable for
such Damages without respect to the Deductible in Section 10.8(a) and the
Indemnification Limit in Section 10.8(b).

(d) To the extent the Contributor Parties are entitled to indemnification for
Damages pursuant to Section 10.1(a), the Partnership shall not be liable for
Damages unless the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds, in the aggregate,
the Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such excess.

(e) In addition, to the extent the Contributor Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 10.1(a), the Partnership shall
not be liable for such Damages that exceed, in the aggregate, the
Indemnification Limit.

(f) Notwithstanding Sections 10.8(d) and 10.8(e) above, to the extent the
Contributor Parties are entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to
Section 10.1(a) for claims arising from actual fraud, the Partnership shall be
fully liable for such Damages without respect to the Deductible in Section
10.8(d) and the Indemnification Limit in Section 10.8(e).

10.9 Sole Remedy. After the Closing, no Party shall have any liability to any
other Party under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
except as is provided in ARTICLE VII or this ARTICLE X (other than claims or
causes of action arising from actual fraud).

10.10 Express Negligence Rule. THE INDEMNIFICATION AND ASSUMPTION PROVISIONS
PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSLY NEGOTIATED IN EVERY DETAIL,
ARE INTENDED TO BE GIVEN FULL AND LITERAL EFFECT, AND SHALL BE APPLICABLE
WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS, LOSSES, COSTS,
EXPENSES OR DAMAGES IN QUESTION WERE FORESEEABLE, ARISE OR AROSE SOLELY OR IN
PART FROM THE GROSS, ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
CONTRACTUAL COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, NO-FAULT OR OTHER FAULT
OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE PARTNERSHIP, KMI AND THE CONTRIBUTORS
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND
CONSTITUTES CONSPICUOUS NOTICE. NOTICE IN THIS CONSPICUOUS NOTICE IS NOT
INTENDED TO PROVIDE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES, ALL OF
WHICH ARE SPECIFIED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.

or remedies hereunder except as ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE X contemplates or

unless executed in writing by each Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a

11.7 Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns; but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, by operation 

of law or otherwise, by any Party without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; provided, that the Partnership may assign its right to receive
the contribution of the Equity Interests to any direct or indirect subsidiary
of the Partnership.

11.8 Severability. If any provision of the Agreement is rendered or declared
illegal or unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted
legislation or by decree of a court of last resort, the Contributors and the
Partnership shall promptly meet and negotiate substitute provisions for those
rendered or declared illegal or unenforceable, but all of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and will
not be affected or impaired in any way thereby.

11.9 Interpretation. The Parties agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore
waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

Sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The schedules referred to herein are attached hereto and
incorporated herein by this reference, and unless the context expressly
requires otherwise, such schedules are incorporated in the definition of

or waiver that is required to be or may be taken or given by the Partnership
(i) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date or

Agreement after the Closing Date, such notice, consent, approval or waiver
shall be taken or given by the Conflicts Committee on behalf of the
