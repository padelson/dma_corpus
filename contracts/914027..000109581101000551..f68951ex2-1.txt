representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,

as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

        1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Company (the "MERGER"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Company as the surviving corporation after
the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."

        1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
a certificate of merger, and such other articles, certificates or other
appropriate filing documents with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law
(collectively, the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") (the time of such filing (or such
later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in
the Certificate of Merger) being the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as practicable on
or after the Closing Date (as herein defined). Unless the context otherwise
requires, the term "AGREEMENT" as used herein refers collectively to this
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and the Certificate of Merger. The closing
of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
California at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no
later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and location as
the parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE").

        1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers,
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

        1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

                (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to Section 5.10(a) of this Agreement,
be amended and restated to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter
amended as provided by law; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Netopia, Inc.

                (b) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to
Section 5.10(a) of this Agreement, be amended and restated to be identical to
those in effect for Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until
thereafter amended.

        1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

        1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following
securities, the following shall occur:

                (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Common
Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any
shares of Company Common Stock ("SHARES") to be cancelled pursuant to Section
1.6(b), will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject
to Sections 1.6(e) and (f)) into the right to receive that number of shares of
Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Parent (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK")
equal to 0.3 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO"), upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in
Section 1.9). If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock
will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement
or other agreement.

                (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Each
share of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.

                (c) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all options to
purchase Company Common Stock and stock appreciation rights then outstanding
under each of Company's 1987 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Stock Option Plan and 2000
Incentive Plan (collectively, the "COMPANY OPTION PLANS"), whether vested or
unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable, with an exercise price per
share (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of less than $14.87, and
the Company Option Plans shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section
5.8 hereof.

                (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock,
$0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001
par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

                (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon
surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as defined in Section 1.7(c)),
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the average
closing price of Parent Common Stock for the five trading days immediately
preceding the last full trading day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market System ("NASDAQ").

        1.7 Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Cash and Stock Consideration.

                (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE
AGENT") in the Merger.

                (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash Consideration. When
and as needed, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for exchange
in accordance with this Article I, (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient for payment in

lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled
pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

                (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event not later than ten (10) business days, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES"), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares whose
Shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f), and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their
shares of Company Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time, payment in
lieu of fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d) as to the
payment of dividends, to evidence only the ownership of the number of full
shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu
of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

                (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this
Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificate(s)
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the
holders of record of such Certificate(s) shall surrender such Certificate(s).
Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate(s), the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, a
certificate(s) representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) hereof and the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate representing
shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other



                                      -5-
<PAGE>   10

taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

                (f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent,
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

                (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 1.7, neither of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar law.

        1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (together with
any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

        1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
1.6, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d);
provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

        1.10 Tax and Accounting Consequences.

                (a) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The
parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax
Regulations.

                (b) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall
be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes.

        1.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title, and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company
and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the manner of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary
action.

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

        As of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to such exceptions as are
specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure letter and schedules thereto
(each such exception referencing the specific section number of this Article II
to which it applies and each other section number of this Article II to the
extent such applicability is reasonably apparent on the face of such exception),
dated as of the date hereof (the "COMPANY SCHEDULE"), as follows:

        2.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Company and its subsidiaries
is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("APPROVALS") necessary
to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such Approvals has not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 8.3(b)(ii)), on Company. Each of Company and its subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing that have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Company.

                (b) Company has no subsidiaries except for the corporations
identified in Section 2.1(b) of the Company Schedule. Neither Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has agreed nor is obligated to make nor be bound by any
written, oral or other agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, binding
understanding, instrument, note, option, warranty, purchase order, license,
sublicense, insurance policy, benefit plan, commitment or undertaking of any
nature, as of the date hereof or as may hereafter be in effect (a "CONTRACT")
under which it may become obligated to make, any future investment in or capital
contribution to any other entity. Neither Company nor any of its

interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business,
association or entity.

        2.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Company has previously
furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of its Certificate of

not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents, and
no subsidiary of Company is in violation of its equivalent organizational
documents.

delivery of this Agreement and the Option Agreement by Company and the
consummation by Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Company are

recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by Delaware Law). This
Agreement and the Option Agreement each has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery

the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including,
without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

        2.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

                (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Option
Agreement by Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
Option Agreement by Company will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Company
Charter Documents or the equivalent organizational documents of any of Company's
subsidiaries; (ii) subject to obtaining the approval of Company's stockholders
of the Merger and compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 2.5(b)
below, to the knowledge of Company, conflict with, or result in any violation
of, any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Company
or any of its subsidiaries or by which either Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties is bound or affected; or (iii) result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or impair Company's or any of its
subsidiaries' rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a material lien or encumbrance on
any of the properties or assets of Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant
to, any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which Company or any of its
subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties are bound or affected.

                (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Option
Agreement by Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Company
will not, require any consent, waiver, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any court, administrative agency, commission,
governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (a "GOVERNMENTAL
ENTITY"), except (A) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "SECURITIES ACT"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"EXCHANGE ACT"), state securities laws ("BLUE SKY LAWS"), the pre-merger
notification requirements (the "HSR APPROVAL") of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust



                                      -10-

Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "HSR ACT"), the rules and regulations of Nasdaq,
state takeover laws and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger
as required by Delaware Law and (B) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company or
a material adverse effect on the ability of Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, or prevent consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent
the parties hereto from performing their obligations under this Agreement.

        2.6 Compliance; Permits.

                (a) Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in conflict
with, or in default or violation of, (i) any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which
its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected or (ii) any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or
any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except for any
conflicts, defaults or violations that (individually or in the aggregate) would
not be material to the business of Company as currently conducted. No
investigation or review by any governmental or regulatory body or authority is
pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against Company or its
subsidiaries, nor has any governmental or regulatory body or authority indicated
to Company or any of its subsidiaries an intention to conduct the same, other
than, in each such case, those the outcome of which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or
materially impairing any current business practice of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, any acquisition of material property by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or the conduct of business by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.

                (b) Company and its subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from governmental authorities which
are material to operation of the business of Company and its subsidiaries taken

Permits.

since December 31, 1999 (the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS"), which are all the forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by Company with the SEC since
December 31, 1999. The Company SEC Reports (A) complied in all material respects
as of their respective dates with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not at the time they were filed
(and if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the



                                      -11-
<PAGE>   16

statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of Company's subsidiaries is required to file any

contain footnotes as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and each fairly
presents the consolidated financial position of Company and its subsidiaries at
the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments that were not or are not expected to be material in amount.

                (c) Company has previously furnished to Parent a complete and
correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed
with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or
other instruments which previously had been filed by Company with the SEC
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

        2.8 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of
a nature required to be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to
the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP which
are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of
operations or financial condition of Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, except (i) liabilities provided for in Company's balance sheet as of
September 30, 2000 and (ii) liabilities incurred since September 30, 2000 in the

by Company or any of its subsidiaries of any increase in severance or
termination pay or any entry by Company or any of its subsidiaries into any
currently effective employment, severance, termination or indemnification
agreement or any agreement the benefits of which are contingent or the terms of
which are materially altered upon the occurrence of a



                                      -12-
<PAGE>   17

transaction involving Company of the nature contemplated hereby; (v) entry by
Company or any of its subsidiaries into any licensing or other agreement with

respect to any licensing agreement filed or required to be filed by Company with
the SEC; (vi) any material change by Company in its accounting methods,
principles or practices, except as required by concurrent changes in GAAP; or

ordinary and usual course of business, consistent with past practice.

        2.10 Absence of Litigation. There are no claims, actions, suits or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened (or, to the
knowledge of Company, any governmental or regulatory investigation pending or
threatened) against Company or any of its subsidiaries or any properties or
rights of Company or any of its subsidiaries, before any court, arbitrator or
administrative, governmental or regulatory authority or body, domestic or
foreign, except for any claims, actions, suits or proceedings which seek damages
of less than $50,000, do not seek injunctive relief and do not challenge or seek
to delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) covering any active, former

Company Products, except for items that may reasonably be expected to be
available for licensing on reasonable terms from third parties.

                (g) No person who has licensed any technology, software or
Intellectual Property Rights to the Company has ownership rights or license
rights granted by Company to improvements made by the Company in such Technology
or Intellectual Property Rights.

                (h) Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has transferred
ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Intellectual
Property that is or was Company Intellectual Property, to any third party, or
permitted Company's rights in such Company Intellectual Property to lapse or
enter the public domain.

                (i) Section 2.19(i) of the Company Schedule lists all material
contracts, licenses and agreements to which Company or any of its subsidiaries
is a party: (i) with respect to Company Intellectual Property licensed or
transferred to any third party (other than end-user licenses or related support
and maintenance agreements in the ordinary course); or (ii) pursuant to which a
third party has licensed or transferred any material Intellectual Property to
Company (other than with respect to standard, generally commercially available
"off the shelf" products).

                (j) All contracts, licenses and agreements material to the
business of the Company as currently conducted and relating to either (i)
Company Intellectual Property or (ii) Intellectual Property of a third party
licensed to Company or any of its subsidiaries, are in full force and effect
(other than those which have expired by their terms). The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will neither violate nor result in
the breach, modification, cancellation, termination or suspension of such
contracts, licenses and agreements. Each of Company and its subsidiaries is in
material compliance with, and has not materially breached any material term of
any such contracts, licenses and agreements and, to the knowledge of Company,
all other parties to such contracts, licenses and agreements are in compliance
with, and have not materially breached any term of, such contracts, licenses and
agreements. Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will be
permitted to exercise all of Company's rights under such contracts, licenses and
agreements to the same extent Company and its subsidiaries would have been able
to had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and without
the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments which Company would otherwise be required to pay. Neither
this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the assignment to Parent or Surviving Corporation by operation of law or
otherwise of any contracts or agreements to which the Company is a party, will
result in (i) either Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's granting to any
third party any right to or with respect to any material Intellectual Property
right owned by, or licensed to, either of them (other than the rights granted in
any contracts or agreements so assigned), (ii) either the Parent's or the
Surviving Corporation's being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or other
material restriction on the operation or scope of their respective businesses or
(iii) either the Parent's or the Surviving Corporation being obligated to pay
any royalties or other material amounts to any third party in



                                      -22-
<PAGE>   27

excess of those payable by Parent or Surviving Corporation, respectively, prior
to Closing (other than any royalties or other material amounts which Company
would have otherwise been required to pay had the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not occurred). The foregoing sentence shall only apply with
respect to contracts of Company.

                (k) The operation of the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries as such business currently is conducted or is contemplated to be
conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including without
limitation (i) Company's and its subsidiaries' design, development, manufacture,
distribution, reproduction, marketing or sale of the products or services of
Company and its subsidiaries (including Company Products) and (ii) the Company's
use of any product, device or process, has not, does not, and will not when
conducted by Parent and/or Surviving Corporation in substantially the same
manner following the Closing, infringe or misappropriate, to the knowledge of
Company with respect to patents, trademarks, service marks and trade names only,
the Intellectual Property of any third party or constitute unfair competition or
trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction.

                (l) Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received
notice from any third party that the operation of the business of Company or any
of its subsidiaries or any act, product or service of Company or any of its
subsidiaries, infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property of any
third party or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the laws
of any jurisdiction.

                (m) To the knowledge of Company, there are no material
contracts, licenses or agreements between the Company and any other person with
respect to Company Intellectual Property under which there is any material
dispute regarding the scope of such agreement, or performance under such
agreement, including with respect to any payments to be made or received by the
Company thereunder.

                (n) To the knowledge of Company, no person has or is infringing
or misappropriating any Company Intellectual Property.

                (o) Company and each of its subsidiaries has taken reasonable
steps to protect Company's and its subsidiaries' rights in Company's
confidential information and trade secrets that it wishes to protect or any
trade secrets or confidential information of third parties provided to Company
or any of its subsidiaries under an obligation of confidentiality, and, without
limiting the foregoing, each of Company and its subsidiaries has and enforces a
policy requiring each employee and contractor to execute a proprietary
information/confidentiality agreement substantially in the form provided to
Parent and all current and former employees, contractors and consultants of
Company and any of its subsidiaries have executed such an agreement.

        2.20 Agreements, Contracts and Commitments. Neither Company nor any of
its subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by:

good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

the registration statement on the S-4 and (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause the S-4 to become effective as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, and, prior to the effective date of the S-4, the parties hereto
shall take all action required under any applicable Laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. Parent or
Company, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning Parent or
Company as the other party may reasonably request in connection with such
actions and the preparation of the S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
As promptly as practicable after the effective date of the S-4, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be mailed to the stockholders of Company and of
Parent. Each of the parties hereto shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to comply as to form and substance to such party in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii)
the Securities Act, and (iii) the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any event relating to Parent or Company or any
of their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by

                (b) The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include (i) the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the recommendation of the Board of

                (c) No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy

the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any

and Company shall use all reasonable efforts to hold the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting and the Company Stockholders' Meeting on the same day and as soon as
practicable after the date on which the S-4 becomes effective. Nothing herein
shall prevent Company or Parent from adjourning or postponing the Company
Stockholders' Meeting or the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be,
if there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock,
as the case may be, necessary to conduct business at their respective meetings
of the stockholders. Unless Company's Board of Directors has withdrawn its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in compliance with Section 5.4,
Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger pursuant to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by Delaware
Law or applicable stock exchange requirements to obtain such approval. Parent
shall use all reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of the Share Issuance pursuant to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
consent of stockholders required by the Delaware Law or applicable stock
exchange requirements to obtain such approval. Company shall call and hold the

previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 27, 2000

party may reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or

                (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company
and its subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, controlled affiliates or employees or any

encourage the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as

to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any

Acquisition Transaction (as defined below); provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of Company
from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that Company's Board of Directors reasonably concludes constitutes a
Superior Proposal (as defined below), engaging in discussions or participating
in negotiations with and furnishing information to the party making such
Acquisition Proposal and approving, endorsing or recommending such Acquisition
Proposal and withdrawing its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger to
the extent (A) the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel (who may be Company's independent
legal counsel acting with respect to this Agreement) its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law require it to do so, (B) (x) at least three (3) (which
shall include at least two (2) business days) days prior to furnishing any such

by or on behalf of Company, and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such party, Company furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished by the Company to Parent). Company and its subsidiaries
will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4 by any officer,
director, controlled affiliate or employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of Company

interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of
the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar

paragraph (a) of this Section 5.4, Company as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within one (1) business day, shall advise Parent orally and in writing

inquiry. In addition to the foregoing, Company shall (i) provide Parent with at
least one (1) business day prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided

(8) hours) of any meeting of Company's Board of Directors at which Company's

<PAGE>   43

will be made prior to any such release or public statement. The parties have

Agreement.

        5.6 Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

                (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts
to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to
cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the
defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether

instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to

limiting the foregoing, Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
the Merger, this Agreement, the Company Voting Agreements, the Option Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger, this Agreement, the Company Voting
Agreements, the Option Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement, the Company Voting
Agreements, the Option Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or Company or any subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates
of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct
their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and
stock.

                (b) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that
the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

        5.7 Third Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Parent and Company will each use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries'
respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        5.8 Stock Options; 401(k) Plan; Employee Benefit Matters.

                (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all options to
purchase Common Stock issued by the Company pursuant to the Company Option
Plans, whether vested or unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable,
provided, however, that no option shall be assumed if, as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the exercise price per share is $14.87 or greater (each a
"COMPANY OPTION"). The Company's repurchase right with respect to any unvested
shares acquired by the exercise of Company Options shall be assigned to Parent
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the
Company or the holder of the outstanding Company Option. Immediately after the
Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option at the
Effective Time, such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the unexercised portion of
such option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number. The exercise price per share of each such assumed Company Option shall
be equal to the exercise price of such option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The
term, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422
of the Code, if applicable, and all of the other terms of the Company Options
shall otherwise remain unchanged. It is the intention of the parties that the
Company Options so assumed by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such
Company Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective
Time. Within 30 business days after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to
each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of a
Company Option assumed by Parent a document evidencing the foregoing assumption
of such option by Parent.

                (b) 401(k) Plans. Effective as of the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, the Company and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall each
terminate any and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such
401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written
notice to the Company, no later than five business days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall provide



                                      -40-
<PAGE>   45

Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated (effective as
of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of
the Company's Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take
such other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent
may reasonably require.

                (c) ESPP. The rights of participants in the Company ESPP with
respect to any offering then underway under the Company ESPP shall be determined
by treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time as the last day of
such offering and by making such other pro rata adjustments as may be necessary
to reflect the shortened offering but otherwise treating such shortened offering
as a fully effective and completed offering for all purposes under the Company
ESPP. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall be
exercised in accordance with Section 13(b) of the Company ESPP, and each share
of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to such exercise shall by virtue of
the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio, without issuance of certificates representing
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to participants under the
Company ESPP. As of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall be terminated.
Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall (i) provide Parent with evidence that
the Company ESPP has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of Company's Board
of Directors; the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
prior review and approval of Parent and (ii) take such other actions (including,
but not limited to, if appropriate, amending the Company ESPP) that are
necessary to give effect to the transaction contemplated by this Section 5.8(c).
Employees of Company who become employees of Parent shall be eligible to
participate in the employee stock purchase plan of Parent (the "PARENT ESPP")
(subject to such plan's terms and conditions) at a special offering period
beginning at the Effective Time.

                (d) Employee Benefit Matters. All employees of Company shall
continue on their existing benefit plans until such time as, in Parent's sole
discretion, an orderly transition can be accomplished to employee benefit plans
and programs maintained by Parent for its and its affiliates' employees. Parent
shall take such reasonable actions, to the extent permitted by Parent's benefits
programs, as are necessary to allow eligible employees of Company to participate
in the health, welfare and other employee benefits (it being understood that
equity incentive plans and tax qualified plans are not considered employee
benefits) programs of Parent or alternative benefits programs that are, in the
aggregate, substantially similar to those applicable to employees of Parent in
similar functions and positions on similar terms. Pending such action, Parent
shall maintain the effectiveness of Company's benefit plans.

        5.9 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file, if available for use by Parent, a
registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options within thirty (30) days
following the Closing.

        5.10 Indemnification.

                (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be
maintained in effect in all respects the current obligations of Company pursuant
to any indemnification agreements



                                      -41-
<PAGE>   46

between Company and its directors and officers in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time and any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter
Documents as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
indemnified parties thereunder (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") as those contained in
the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is
required by law.

                (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available,
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy on terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and
officers of the Company; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage
in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company, it being
understood that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage
as may be obtained for such 150% amount.

                (c) This Section 5.10 is intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
respective successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor
the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

        5.11 Nasdaq Listing. Parent agrees to authorize for listing on Nasdaq
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to be reserved
for issuance, in connection with the Merger, upon official notice of issuance.

        5.12 Affiliates. Set forth in Section 5.12 of the Company Schedule is a
list of those persons who may be deemed to be, in Company's reasonable judgment,
affiliates of Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act (each, a "COMPANY AFFILIATE"). Company will provide Parent with
such information and documents as Parent reasonably requests for purposes of
reviewing such list. Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, as promptly as practicable on or
following the date hereof, from each Company Affiliate an executed affiliate
agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "COMPANY
AFFILIATE AGREEMENT"). Parent will be entitled to place appropriate legends on
the certificates evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by a Company
Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock,
consistent with the terms of the Company Affiliate Agreement.

<PAGE>   47

        5.13 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts. As soon as may be
reasonably practicable, Company and Parent each shall file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and Report Forms
relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as
well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger
notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as
agreed to by the parties. Company and Parent each shall promptly (a) supply the
other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such
filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may be
required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of
any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to agree to any divestiture
by Parent or the Company or any of Parent's subsidiaries or affiliates of shares
of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or its
subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company, its affiliates, or the imposition
of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock
(assuming for purposes of determining materiality in this Section 5.13 that the
Merger shall have been effected).

        5.14 Parent Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of Parent will
take all actions necessary such that one member of Company's Board of Directors
reasonably acceptable to Parent (which initially shall be Alan Lefkof, provided
that he has executed an employment agreement with Parent which shall be in full
force and effect as of the Effective Time), shall be appointed as a director and
co-Chairman of Parent's Board of Directors as of the Effective Time with a term
expiring at the next annual meeting of Parent's stockholders after such
appointment.

        5.15 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

proceeding for that purpose, and no similar proceeding in respect of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, shall have been initiated or threatened in writing
by the SEC.

enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary,

the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger. All
waiting periods, if any, under the HSR Act relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby will have expired or terminated early and all material
foreign antitrust approvals required to be obtained prior to the Merger in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained.

Franklin & Hachigian, LLP, respectively), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to them, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and such
opinions shall not have been withdrawn; provided, however, that if the counsel
to either Parent or Company does not render such opinion, this condition shall
nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied with respect to such party if counsel to
the other party renders such opinion to such party. The parties to this
Agreement agree to make such reasonable representations as requested by such
counsel for the purpose of rendering such opinions.

                (e) Nasdaq Listing. The shares of Parent Common Stock issuable

warranties shall be disregarded and (ii) any update of or modification to the
Parent Schedule made or purported to have been made after the date of this

Directors of Parent and Company;

                (b) by either Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have
been consummated by June 30, 2001 for any reason; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause
of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes (i) a material breach of this
Agreement or (ii) a material acquisition or proposed acquisition by Parent;

                (c) by either Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final and
nonappealable;

                (d) by either Company or Parent if (i) the required approval of
the stockholders of Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a meeting of
Company stockholders duly convened therefor or at any adjournment therefor or
(ii) the required approval by the stockholders of Parent of the Share Issuance
required under applicable Nasdaq rules shall not have been obtained by reason of
the failure to obtain the required vote at a meeting of Parent stockholders duly

covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if

case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b)
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such
inaccuracy in Parent's representations and warranties or breach by Parent is
curable by Parent, then Company may not



                                      -46-
<PAGE>   51

terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) for so long as Parent
continues to exercise best efforts to cure such breach;

                (f) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Company set forth in this Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty of Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b)
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such
inaccuracy in Company's representations and warranties or breach by Company is
curable by Company, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.1(f) for so long as Company continues to exercise best efforts to cure
such breach; or

                (g) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of Company

Merger in a manner adverse to Parent or its stockholders, (ii) the Board of
Directors of Company shall have recommended to the stockholders of Company an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Company fails to comply with Section 5.4 in all
material respects, (iv) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been announced or

(A) failed to recommend against acceptance of such by its stockholders
(including by taking no position, or indicating its inability to take a
position, with respect to the acceptance by its stockholders of an Acquisition
Proposal involving a tender offer or exchange offer) or (B) failed to reconfirm
its approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby within five business days thereafter, or (v) the Board of
Directors of Company resolves to take any of the actions described above.

        7.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any termination of
this Agreement under Section 7.1 above will be effective immediately upon the

be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in this Section 7.2,
Section 5.3(a), Section 7.3 and Article VIII, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for fraud in connection with, or any willful breach of, this
Agreement.

        7.3 Fees and Expenses.

                (a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and Company
shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys' and accountants
fees and expenses, incurred (i) in relation to the printing and filing of the

                (b) Termination Fee.

                        (i) In the event that (A) Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), or (B) this Agreement shall be terminated
(x) pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or (y) pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) and (1) at
or prior to such termination, there shall exist or have been publicly proposed a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal relating to a Company Acquisition with a person
or group reasonably capable of consummating a Company Acquisition and (2) within
12 months after such termination, Company shall enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition or any Company Acquisition
shall be consummated, then, in the case of clause (A), promptly after such
termination, or in the case of clause (B), concurrently with the execution of a
definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, as applicable,
such Company Acquisition, Company shall pay to Parent $6.7 million in cash (the
"TERMINATION FEE").

                        (ii) The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a
timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(b), the Company shall pay
to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this Section 7.3(b) at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described in
this Section 7.3(b) shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of
breach of this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY
ACQUISITION" shall mean any of the following transactions (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (A) a merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the
Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 60% of the
aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction, (B) a sale or other disposition by the Company of assets
representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate fair market value of the
Company's business immediately prior to such sale or (C) the acquisition by any
person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or
issuance by the Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a
right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of
the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

        7.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended
by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company.

        7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set



                                      -48-
<PAGE>   53

        8.3 Interpretation; Definitions.

                (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such
reference shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be
to a Section of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated the words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is
made herein to "the business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to
include the business of all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such entity.
Reference to the subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to include all direct
and indirect subsidiaries of such entity.

                (b) For purposes of this Agreement:

                        (i) the term "KNOWLEDGE" means with respect to a party
hereto, with respect to any matter in question, actual knowledge of the
executive officers of such party after reasonable inquiry;

                        (ii) the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" when used in
connection with an entity means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy,
circumstance or effect that is, or is reasonably likely to be, materially
adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition,
capitalization, or results of operations of such entity and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole; provided, however, that in no event shall (A) a decrease in
such entity's stock price or the failure to meet or exceed Wall Street research
analysts' or such entity's internal earnings or other estimates or projections
in and of itself constitute a Material Adverse Effect or (B) any change, event,
violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that such entity successfully
bears the burden of proving results from (x) changes affecting the industry in
which such entity operates generally (which changes do not



                                      -50-
<PAGE>   55

disproportionately affect such entity) or (y) changes affecting the United
States economy generally, constitute a Material Adverse Effect; provided
further, that in no event shall the following be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or will be a Material Adverse Effect: (1) any
adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development to the
extent primarily and directly attributable to the announcement or pendency of
the Merger (including any cancellations of or delays in customer orders, any
reductions in sales, any disruption in supplier, distributor, partner or similar
relationships or any loss of employees that is so attributable), provided,
however, that the party claiming that such change, effect, event, occurrence,
state of fact or development does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect shall
bear the burden of showing that it is primarily and directly attributable to the
announcement or pendency of the Merger, or (2) any litigation commenced or
threatened against Company or Parent or any member of the Board of Directors of
Company or Parent in respect of this Agreement; and

                        (iii) the term "PERSON" shall mean any individual,
corporation (including any non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited
partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust,
company (including any limited liability company or joint stock company), firm
or other enterprise, association, organization, entity or Governmental Entity.

        8.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

        8.5 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Schedule and the
Parent Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement; and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided in
Section 5.10.

        8.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably
to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

        8.7 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of



                                      -51-
<PAGE>   56

this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

        8.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

        8.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

        8.10 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.
