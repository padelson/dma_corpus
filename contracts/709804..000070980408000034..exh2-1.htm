setting forth all persons who are &quot;disqualified individuals&quot; as described below, a detailed list of the payments that the disqualified
individuals may receive (under this Agreement or any other contract, plan or arrangement with the Company or otherwise, including severance
payments, and acceleration of vesting or benefits under options or restricted stock), and the payroll and compensation data needed to perform
calculations under Section 280G of the Code.  The Company will also deliver within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof a description of any
family or other relationships among the Stockholders that would result in attribution of ownership under Section&nbsp;318 of the Code for the
purposes set forth above, together with a worksheet or memorandum from the Company's outside accountants or other professional advisor
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser demonstrating the extent (if any) to which such payments, vesting or benefits constitute &quot;excess
parachute payments&quot; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;280G of the Code will be made to such disqualified individuals.  If for any
reason it appears to such independent accounting firm or other professional advisor that a disqualified individual will receive an excess
parachute payment, then the balance of this Section&nbsp;5.7 will apply, in addition to any other rights and remedies the Purchaser may have.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will submit to, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain, a stockholder vote or written consent approving
or denying the right of any &quot;disqualified individual&quot; (as defined in Section&nbsp;280G(c) of the Code) to receive or retain any and all
payments that could be deemed &quot;parachute payments&quot; under Section&nbsp;280G of the Code (or, if such payments are not
approved, then such payments shall be forfeited the extent that any such payments would constitute &quot;parachute payments&quot; under
Section 280G of the Code), on the following terms and conditions interpreted in a manner which complies with Section&nbsp;280G of the Code
and all applicable final, proposed or temporary regulations thereunder:  (a)&nbsp;such payments so submitted for approval will be computed
without reduction for any amounts which could otherwise be treated as excludible, reasonable compensation for services rendered before or
after the Effective Time under Section&nbsp;280G(b)(4) of the Code; (b)&nbsp;the stockholder approval will be timely solicited in form and
substance and pursuant to such disclosure as will be sufficient to satisfy the stockholder approval requirements for the private company
exemption of Section&nbsp;280G(b)(5) of the Code, including requirements that such disqualified individual waive in advance the right to such
payment if the requisite stockholder approval is not obtained, and such payments will be separately approved within the meaning of such
regulations; and (c)&nbsp;for such approval to be effective as to any such payment, more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power
of the Company will have approved such payment without counting as outstanding or permitting to vote (except, as contemplated by Treasury

Requisite Stockholder Approval.  Within two (2) Business Days after circulating the Stockholder Materials and obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval the Company shall send to each Stockholder who may be eligible to exercise dissenters' appraisal rights under the
DGCL, the CGCL or other applicable Law, all notices and information required in connection therewith under applicable Law and necessary to
commence any notice or other time period after which such dissenters' appraisal rights can not be exercised.</P>

promptly selecting the arbitrator (or arbitrators, as applicable) from J.A.M.S.'s panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings in
order to fulfill the provisions, purposes and intent of this Agreement.  The parties covenant that they will participate in the arbitration in good

provisions of this Section 9.2(e) may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement will be entitled to an
award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.  Judgment upon
the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.  If for any reason J.A.M.S. or its successor no
longer is in business, then the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
Association.  Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law and

right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve any such claim (and the costs and expenses incurred by the
Purchaser in connection with such defense, settlement or resolution (including reasonable attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees

made hereunder).  The Stockholder Representative shall have the right, upon request, to periodically receive copies of all material pleadings,
material notices and material communications with respect to the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect
any privilege relating to any Purchaser Indemnified Party and shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
any defense of the third-party claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the third-party claim.  However, except with the consent of the
Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to have
been given unless the Stockholder Representative shall have objected within fifteen (15) days after a written request for such consent by the
Purchaser), no settlement or resolution by the Purchaser of any claim that gives rise to an Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Fund by or

each party to be bound by the amendment and that identifies itself as an amendment to this Agreement.  Any amendment of this Agreement
signed by the Stockholder Representative is binding upon and effective against each Stockholder regardless of whether or not such Stockholder
has in fact signed such amendment.</P>
<P>11.4 &nbsp; <U>Waiver and Remedies</U>.  The parties may (a)&nbsp;extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any

contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)&nbsp;waive compliance
with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement.  Any such extension or waiver by
any party to this Agreement will be valid only if set forth in a written document signed on behalf of the party or parties against whom the waiver
or extension is to be effective.  Any such extension or waiver signed by the Stockholder Representative is binding upon and effective against

remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the parties,
shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further

successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign any rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser.  No party may delegate any performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Purchaser may at any time
delegate the performance of its obligations to any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the Purchaser remains fully responsible for the
performance of the delegated obligation.  Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person, other than

Agreement except such rights as may inure to a successor or permitted assignee under this Section.</P>
<P>11.7 &nbsp; <U>Severability</U>.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace
such invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under
this Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.</P>
<P>11.8 &nbsp; <U>Interpretation</U>.  The language used in this Agreement is the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party because that party or its attorney drafted the provision.</P>

(without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and its exhibits and
schedules and all of the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement and any
disputes or controversies arising therefrom.</P>
<P>11.10 &nbsp; <U>Disputes</U>.  The Purchaser and the Company (or, after the Effective Time, the Stockholder Representative) agree to use their

Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and
the courts hearing appeals from such courts).  The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient
forum in connection therewith.  </P>

<P>11.12 &nbsp; <U>Counterparts</U>.  The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against

counterpart from each party to the other parties.  The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same counterpart.  The delivery of signed
counterparts by facsimile or email transmission that includes a copy of the sending party's signature is as effective as signing and delivering the

negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of its
advisors and representatives; <U>provided</U>, <U>howeve</U>r, that if the Merger is consummated, the Purchaser shall pay all Closing

be subject to any rights of such party arising from any breach of this Agreement by another party.</P>
