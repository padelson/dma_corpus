 the Purchaser may reasonably specify and contain an agreement to be bound by

 4. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. Any Net Merger Consideration, payments paid or issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificates and there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

2.5 _Escheat_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation will be

applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. In the event any
Certificate has not been surrendered for exchange prior to the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing Date, or prior to such earlier date as of which
such Certificate or the Net Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, then the Net Merger Consideration otherwise payable upon the
surrender of such Certificate     

 will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all rights, interests and adverse
claims of any person.

  

2.6 _Dissenter\'s Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised the
holder\'s appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or any
successor provision, or other applicable Law providing for dissenting
stockholders\' appraisal rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, any of the Net Merger
Consideration (including without limitation any part of the Closing Payment
or the Escrow Amount), unless and until such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\'s right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL, or such other applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses his right to appraisal, then such Dissenting Shares will thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time as provided
in Section 2.1(b) into the right to receive the Net Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled in respect of such shares of Series G Preferred
Stock under Section 2.1(b) of this Agreement (if any), without interest or
dividends thereon, upon the surrender of the Certificate(s) which formerly
represented such Dissenting Shares, in the manner provided in Section 2.4;
_provided_ that only holders of such former Dissenting Shares that were shares
of Series G Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be entitled to receive any Net
Merger Consideration and will only be entitled to receive any Net Merger
Consideration that, under the provisions of Section 2.1(b) hereof, is
payable with respect to such shares of Series G Preferred Stock that were
issued and outstanding, and held by such holder, immediately prior to
the Effective Time. The Company will give the Purchaser (a) prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company
Capital Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instrument
served pursuant to the DGCL, or other applicable Law, and received by the
Company relating to Stockholders\' rights of appraisal, and (b) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL, or other applicable Law. The Company
will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment, except with the prior written consent of
the Purchaser.

 2. Upon the Effective Time, the Purchaser Loans shall be deemed repaid in full to the Purchaser by the application of the Purchaser Closing Loan Balance to reduce the Net Merger Consideration (as provided in Section 2.1(a)(iii) hereof), and any and all securities, agreements and instruments evidencing the Purchaser Loans shall be deemed satisfied, cancelled and terminated.

 

 3. The Purchaser will pay or cause the Company to pay the Special Employee Bonus Pool as and when such payment becomes due in accordance with the terms of the Special Employee Bonus Pool, as set forth in _Section 3.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

5.6 _Confidentiality_.

 

  

 1. For purposes of securities law compliance, each party agrees not to issue any press release or make any other public announcement relating to this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, except that the Purchaser reserves the right, without the Company\'s prior     

 

 consent, to make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required
by applicable securities laws or securities listing standards (in which case
the Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to advise the Company prior to
making such disclosure).

  

 2. Each party agrees to continue to abide by that certain non-disclosure agreement dated as of July 13, 2007 by and between the Purchaser and the Company (the " _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated by reference in this Agreement and which terms will survive until the Closing, at which time the Non-Disclosure Agreement will terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Non-Disclosure Agreement will continue in full force and effect. 

  

5.7 _Section 280G Matters_. Within one (1) Business Day after the date
hereof, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser a list setting forth all
persons who are "disqualified individuals" as described below, a detailed list
of the payments that the disqualified individuals may receive (under this
Agreement or any other contract, plan or arrangement with the Company or
otherwise, including severance payments, and acceleration of vesting or
benefits under options or restricted stock), and the payroll and compensation
data needed to perform calculations under Section 280G of the Code. The
Company will also deliver within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof a
description of any family or other relationships among the Stockholders that
would result in attribution of ownership under Section 318 of the Code for
the purposes set forth above, together with a worksheet or memorandum from
the Company\'s outside accountants or other professional advisor reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser demonstrating the extent (if any) to which such
payments, vesting or benefits constitute "excess parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code will be made to such disqualified
individuals. If for any reason it appears to such independent accounting firm
or other professional advisor that a disqualified individual will receive an
excess parachute payment, then the balance of this Section 5.7 will apply, in
addition to any other rights and remedies the Purchaser may have. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company will submit to, and use all reasonable efforts
to obtain, a stockholder vote or written consent approving or denying the
right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) to receive or retain any and all payments that could be deemed
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code (or, if such payments are
not approved, then such payments shall be forfeited the extent that any such
payments would constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the
Code), on the following terms and conditions interpreted in a manner which
complies with Section 280G of the Code and all applicable final, proposed or
temporary regulations thereunder: (a) such payments so submitted for approval
will be computed without reduction for any amounts which could otherwise be
treated as excludible, reasonable compensation for services rendered before
or after the Effective Time under Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code; (b) the
stockholder approval will be timely solicited in form and substance and
pursuant to such disclosure as will be sufficient to satisfy the stockholder
approval requirements for the private company exemption of Section 280G(b)(5)
of the Code, including requirements that such disqualified individual waive in
advance the right to such payment if the requisite stockholder approval is
not obtained, and such payments will be separately approved within the meaning
of such regulations; and (c) for such approval to be effective as to any such
payment, more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the
Company will have approved such payment without counting as outstanding or
permitting to vote (except, as contemplated by Treasury Regulations Section
1.280G-1, QandA-7(b)(4)), any stock (i) actually owned or constructively owned
under Section 318(a) of the Code by or for such disqualified individual, or
(ii) as to which the owner of such stock is considered under Section 318(a)
of the Code to own any part of the stock owned directly or indirectly by or
for such disqualified individual.

  

5.8 _Stockholder Materials_. Within ten (10) Business Days of the execution
of this Agreement, the Company will deliver an information statement, the
form of written consent required    

 pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement and all information that may
be required to be given to the Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL (and CGCL)

notice of the Merger and information concerning dissenters\' appraisal rights
under the DGCL (and CGCL), and any other applicable Law (the " _Stockholder

other applicable Law. Prior to the delivery of the Stockholder Materials, the
Company will have given the Purchaser and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
(but in no event fewer than three (3) Business Days) to review and comment on
drafts of the Stockholder Materials. The form of written consent will
include language to the effect that each consenting Stockholder agrees to be
bound by the indemnification provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement as if
the consenting Stockholder were a signatory to this Agreement and will
otherwise be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser.
The Stockholder Materials will also specify the address to which any notices
concerning dissenters\' rights must be sent and will request that a copy of
such notice be sent to the Purchaser at an address specified by the Purchaser.
At the time it is sent and at all times subsequent thereto (through and
including the Effective Time), the Stockholder Materials will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, not misleading;  _provided, however_ , that the Company will not be
responsible for information about the Purchaser which is accurately stated
from information which the Purchaser has publicly released or filed (provided
that the Company has obtained the Purchaser\'s consent prior to use of such
publicly released or filed information) or otherwise provided by the Purchaser
or its representatives (including counsel), in writing, for use in the
Stockholder Materials. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
or information should be discovered by the Company which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Stockholder Materials, then the Company
will promptly inform the Purchaser of such occurrence, and the Company will
deliver to the Stockholders such amendment or supplement. The Stockholder
Materials will include the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors
of the Company in favor of this Agreement and the Merger and the conclusion of

promptly from all of the Stockholders written consents in favor of the Merger
and take all other action necessary to secure the approval of all such
Stockholders, including the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Within two (2)
Business Days after circulating the Stockholder Materials and obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval the Company shall send to each Stockholder who
may be eligible to exercise dissenters\' appraisal rights under the DGCL, the
CGCL or other applicable Law, all notices and information required in
connection therewith under applicable Law and necessary to commence any
notice or other time period after which such dissenters\' appraisal rights can
not be exercised.

 

5.10 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Each of the parties hereto will
use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the

following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least

bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six (6)
year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise

in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.
In the event that the Purchaser elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior
to the Effective Time and the Merger is consummated, the Purchaser and the

force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder for so long as such "tail" DandO Insurance policy shall

 3. the nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement, including without limitation Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) hereto; 

 

 4. any error or understatement of any liabilities or amounts payable that were used to compute the Net Merger Consideration, including without limitation any claim or claims for payment (whether asserted by a Person who is a Stockholder or other security holder of the Company or any other Person) under the Management Liquidation Pool which is or are inconsistent or in conflict with the Management Liquidation Pool Allocation Schedule and any claim or claims for payment under the Special Employee Bonus Pool which is or are inconsistent or in conflict with the terms set forth in _Section 3.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; 

 

 5. any inaccuracy in the Closing Adjustment Certificate or the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule, including without limitation any claim or claims for payment which is or are inconsistent or in conflict with the Final Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule; 

 

 6. any assertion or recovery by any Stockholder of the fair value, interest, and expenses or other amounts pursuant to dissenters\' rights exercised or purportedly exercised pursuant to the DGCL, the CGCL or any other Law (it being understood that any such Losses will not include the Pro Rata Share of the Net Merger Consideration such asserting or recovering Stockholder would have received pursuant to Section 2.1(b) of this Agreement in the Merger in respect of the shares of Company Capital Stock of such Stockholder with respect to which such dissenters\' rights were exercised or purportedly exercised);

 

 7. any payments made by the Purchaser in satisfaction of its obligations under Section 5.12 hereto;

 

 8. any claim or claims by or on behalf of any Continuing Employee in connection with such Continuing Employee\'s Waiver and Release Agreement and/or Option Termination Documentation.

  

Materiality standards or qualifications in any representation, warranty or
covenant shall only be taken into account in determining whether a breach of
or default in connection with such representation, warranty or covenant (or
failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct) exists, and
shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of any Losses with
respect to such breach, default or failure to be true and correct.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that any Purchaser Indemnified Party may bring an Indemnification
Claim for any Losses under this _Article 9_ notwithstanding the fact that such
Purchaser Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event or
circumstance giving rise to such Losses prior to the Closing or waived any
condition to the Closing related thereto.    

9.2 _Claim Procedure_.

 

  

 1. The Purchaser may give written notice of an indemnification claim under this Article 9, whether for its own Losses or for Losses incurred by any other Purchaser Indemnified Party (each such claim, an " _Indemnification Claim_ "), and Purchaser will give written notice of such Indemnification Claim executed by an officer of the Purchaser (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if such Indemnification Claim involves recovery against the Escrow Fund) containing (i) a description and, if known, the maximum potential amount of Losses for which the Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party may be liable, including the amount of any Losses that may already have been incurred, paid, reserved or accrued (ii) a reasonable summary explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the facts then known by the Purchaser Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for payment of those Losses or potential Losses.

 

 2. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Stockholder Representative will deliver to the Purchaser Indemnified Party (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) a written response in which the Stockholder Representative will either:

   

 1. agree that the Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Losses at issue in the Claim Notice; or

 

 2. dispute the Purchaser Indemnified Party\'s entitlement to indemnification (including, if applicable, a dispute as to the determination of the amount of any Reserved Escrow Fund Funds, if applicable) by delivering to the Purchaser Indemnified Party a written notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail each disputed item, the basis for each such disputed item and certifying that all such disputed items are being disputed in good faith.

  

 3. If the Stockholder Representative fails to take either of the foregoing actions within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Stockholder Representative will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Claim Notice and the Stockholder Representative will be deemed to have irrevocably agreed to pay the Losses at issue in the Claim Notice.

 

 4. If the Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice to the Purchaser Indemnified Party (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) with respect to all or any portion of a Claim Notice (a " _Contested Claim_ ") within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice, then the dispute shall be resolved by a written settlement agreement executed by the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (a copy of which shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent) or in the absence of such a written settlement agreement being reached within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Purchaser Indemnified Party of the Objection Notice, by any legally available means consistent with the provisions of Section 11.11 or, at either the Purchaser\'s or the Stockholder Representative\'s option and discretion, by binding arbitration pursuant to Section 9.2(e). 

  

 5. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that, at either the Purchaser\'s or the Stockholder Representative\'s option and discretion, any Contested Claim will be submitted to mandatory, final and binding arbitration before J.A.M.S./ENDISPUTE or its successor ( _"_ _J.A.M.S._ _"_ ), governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C., Section 1 et seq. and that any such arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California. Either the Purchaser or the Stockholder Representative may commence the arbitration process called for by this Agreement by filing a written demand for arbitration with J.A.M.S. and giving a copy of such demand to each of the other parties to this Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of J.A.M.S.\'s     

 

 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing
of the demand for arbitration, subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.2(e). The arbitration of such Contested Claim shall be conducted by
a single arbitrator mutually agreed on by the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative and selected from J.A.M.S.\'s panel of neutrals. The parties
will cooperate with J.A.M.S. and with each other in promptly selecting the
arbitrator (or arbitrators, as applicable) from J.A.M.S.\'s panel of neutrals,
and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings in order to fulfill the
provisions, purposes and intent of this Agreement. The parties covenant that
they will participate in the arbitration in good faith, and that the parties
to the arbitration will bear the expense of deposits and advances required by
the arbitrator in equal proportions. The provisions of this Section 9.2(e)
may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking
enforcement will be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses,
including attorneys\' fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement
is ordered. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court having competent jurisdiction. If for any reason J.A.M.S. or its
successor no longer is in business, then the arbitration shall be conducted
in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration Association. Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings
hereunder, the arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law
and a final written arbitration award setting forth the basis and reasons for
any decision reached (the _"_ _Final Award_ _"_ ) and will promptly deliver
such documents to Escrow Agent, the Stockholder Representative and the
Purchaser, together with a copy of the Final Award signed by the arbitrator. 

  

 6. The foregoing indemnification payments will be made within five (5) Business Days after the date on which (i) the amount of such payments are determined by mutual settlement agreement of the parties, (ii) the amount of such payments are determined pursuant to Section 9.3(c) if an Objection Notice has not been timely delivered in accordance with Section 9.3(b) or (iii) both such amount and the Series G Holders\' obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final Judgment of a court having jurisdiction over such proceeding as permitted by Section 11.11 or by binding arbitration in accordance with Section 9.2(e), if in either case an Objection Notice has been timely delivered in accordance with Section 9.3(b) (the " _Settlement Date_ ").

  

9.3 _Third Party Claims_. In the event the Purchaser becomes aware of a
third-party claim which the Purchaser in good faith believes may result in an
Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Fund by or on behalf of an Purchaser
Indemnified Party, the Purchaser shall have the right in its sole discretion
to conduct the defense of and to settle or resolve any such claim (and the
costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with such defense,
settlement or resolution (including reasonable attorneys\' fees, other
professionals\' and experts\' fees and court or arbitration costs) shall
constitute Losses for which the Purchaser may seek indemnification pursuant to
an Indemnification Claim made hereunder). The Stockholder Representative
shall have the right, upon request, to periodically receive copies of all
material pleadings, material notices and material communications with respect
to the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not
affect any privilege relating to any Purchaser Indemnified Party and shall be
entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or
conduct, any defense of the third-party claim or settlement negotiations with
respect to the third-party claim. However, except with the consent of
the Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and which shall be deemed to have been given
unless the Stockholder Representative shall have objected within fifteen (15)
days after a written request for such consent by the Purchaser), no
settlement or resolution by the Purchaser of any claim that gives rise to an
Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Fund by or on behalf of a Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be determinative of the existence of or amount of
Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative has consented to any such settlement or resolution, neither the
Stockholder Representative nor any Series G Holder shall have any power or
authority to object under _Section 9.2_ or    

 any other provision of this _Article 9_ to the amount of any
Indemnification Claim by or on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Party
against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement or
resolution.

  

9.4 _Survival_. All representations and warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
and the corresponding right to make Indemnification Claims thereunder, will
survive the Closing, irrespective of any facts known to any Purchaser
Indemnified Party at or prior to the Closing or any investigation at any time
made by or on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Party, for a period of
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.16(d) and (f)
(Employee Benefit Matters) will survive and remain operative and in full force
and effect, irrespective of any facts known to any Purchaser Indemnified
Party at or prior to the Closing or any investigation at any time made by or
on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Party, for a period of forty-two (42)
months from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Special Representations (other than Sections 3.16(d) and (f) (Employee
Benefit Matters) will survive and remain operative and in full force and
effect, irrespective of any facts known to any Purchaser Indemnified Party at
or prior to the Closing or any investigation at any time made by or on behalf
of any Purchaser Indemnified Party, until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations; _provided_ , _further_ , that no right to
indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 in respect of any Indemnification
Claim that is set forth in a Claim Notice delivered to the Stockholder
Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if such Indemnification Claim
involves recovery against the Escrow Fund) prior to the expiration of a
representation or warranty shall be affected by the expiration of such
representation or warranty; _provided_ , further, that such expiration shall
not affect the rights of any Purchaser Indemnified Party under this Article 9
or otherwise to seek recovery for Losses arising out of any fraud or willful
misconduct until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. All
representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement
and any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the
Closing, irrespective of any facts known to the Company at or prior to the
Closing or any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of the Company,
for a period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date. If the Merger is
consummated, all covenants of the parties shall expire and be of no further
force and effect as the Effective Time, except to the extent such covenants
provide that they are to be performed after the Effective Time; provided,
however, that no right to indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 in
respect of any Indemnification Claim based upon any breach of a covenant shall
be affected by the expiration of such covenant.

  

9.5 _Limitations on Liability_.

 

  

 1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Liability of the Series G Holders under this Agreement will be subject to the following limitations:

   

 1. In no event will the Series G Holders have any Liability under this Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Series G Holders would otherwise be liable under this Article 9 exceed $200,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), at which point the Series G Holders\' Liability shall be for all Losses, including the amount of the Threshold; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply with respect to Losses directly or indirectly resulting from fraud or willful misconduct or any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 _(Tax Matters)._

  

 2. The Series G Holders\' Liability with respect to Indemnification Claims arising under Section 9.1(a) will not exceed the Escrow Fund, and the rights of a Purchaser Indemnified Party to assert Indemnification Claims against the Escrow Fund under this Article 9 will be the sole and      

   

 exclusive remedy of a Purchaser Indemnified Party for any such claim (other
than with respect to any equitable remedies available to any Purchaser
Indemnified Party), and no Series G Holder will have any Liability in excess
of its Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund with respect to any such claims,
except as provided in Section 9.5(a)(iii) hereof.

  

 3. The initial sources for the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to recover Losses for which they may be entitled under this Article 9 will be to set off, recover and retain such Losses from the Escrow Fund. At such time and to the extent that the Losses for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek indemnity under Section 9.1(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and/or (h) hereof exceed the amount of the Escrow Fund, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will have the right to recover such remaining Losses directly from the Series G Holders; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties\' recovery from each Series G Holder apart from the Escrow Fund shall be limited to each Series G Holder\'s Pro Rata Share of the Net Merger Consideration.

 

 4. For purposes of clarity, it is expressly understood that in no event and under no circumstances will Stockholders who do not own any shares of Series G Preferred Stock have any Liability under this Article 9.

  

 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement limits the Liability of a party to another party for fraud or willful misconduct.

 

 3. The amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is provided pursuant to this Article 9 will be net of any amounts of any credits, discounts, insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements to the extent actually received by, or paid in kind to, the Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto; provided, however, that for the sake of clarity, in no event shall the Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party be required to recover under any insurance policies or pursue any such credits, discounts, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements prior to seeking recovery against the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article 9; provided however, that with respect to claims arising under Section 9.1(g) (a " _9.1(g) Indemnification Claim_ "), the Purchaser shall be required to submit a claim seeking full recovery under the DandO Insurance , and the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to obtain payment of insurance proceeds in respect of such claim under the DandO Insurance to the extent available (" _Claim Proceeds_ "). In no event, however, shall the Purchaser have any obligation to sue the DandO Insurance Carrier or engage in any other dispute resolution process with the DandO Insurance carrier to recover the Claim Proceeds nor shall the Purchaser have any obligation to delay or defer its efforts to assert a 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim or to pursue or prosecute any suit, arbitration or other process permitted by this Agreement to recover the Losses asserted under such 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim. If the DandO Insurance carrier fails to pay the Claim Proceeds to the Purchaser promptly after the Purchaser\'s claim submission, and if the Purchaser recovers any of its Losses under such 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim from any Series G Holders pursuant to a 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim then: (i) such recovered sums will be net of any Claim Proceeds previously received by the Purchaser in respect of such 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim (if any); and (ii) if the Purchaser recovers the full amount of the Losses arising from such 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim from the Escrow Fund and/or directly from any Series G Holder(s), then the Purchaser shall assign its rights to such unpaid Claim Proceeds in respect of such 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim to the Series G Holder(s) who forfeited Escrow Funds or paid additional funds to satisfy such 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim (pro rata according to the amount of Escrow Funds forfeited and additional funds paid by each such Series G Holder to satisfy such 9.1(g) Indemnification Claim) to the extent of such forfeitures and/or payments made by such Series G Holder(s).   

9.6 _No Right of Indemnification or Contribution_. No Series G Holder has
any right of indemnification, contribution or right of advancement from the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates
with respect to any Losses claimed by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, whether
by virtue of any contractual or statutory right of indemnity or otherwise, and
all claims to the contrary are hereby waived and released.

 

9.7 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The parties expressly agree that any
payment by a Series G Holder to any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article 9 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and
shall be reported consistently therewith by the parties.

  

ARTICLE 10 
  _TAX MATTERS_

   

10.1 _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Purchaser, the Company, and the
Stockholder Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Proceeding with respect to Taxes.

 

10.2 _Tax Sharing Agreement_. Any Tax sharing agreements or arrangements to
which the Company may be a party or have Liability will be terminated
effective as of the Closing. After the Closing, neither the Stockholders nor
their Affiliates will have any further rights or Liabilities thereunder.

 

10.3 _Powers of Attorney_. Any power of attorney or similar agreement to
which the Company may be a party with respect to Taxes will be terminated
effective as of the Closing.

  

ARTICLE 11 
  _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

   

11.1 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

  

 1. By virtue of their approval of the Merger, each Stockholder designates and appoints the Stockholder Representative as such Stockholder\'s agent and attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act for and on behalf of each Stockholder to give and receive notices and communications, to accept service of process on behalf of the Stockholders pursuant to Article 9 and Section 11.11, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with Judgments of courts or other Governmental Authorities and awards of arbitrators, with respect to, any Indemnification Claims by any Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Series G Holder pursuant to Article 9 and to take all actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

 2. The Stockholder Representative may delegate its authority as Stockholder Representative to any one of the Series G Holders for a fixed or indeterminate period of time upon not less than ten (10) Business Days\' prior written notice to the Purchaser in accordance with Section 11.2. In the event of the death or incapacity of the Stockholder Representative, a successor Stockholder Representative will be elected promptly by the Series G Holders whose interests aggregate not less than a majority of the Net Merger Consideration and the Series G Holders will so notify the Purchaser. Each successor Stockholder Representative shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges     

 

 conferred by this Agreement upon the original Stockholder Representative,
and the term "Stockholder Representative" as used in this Agreement includes
any successor Stockholder Representative appointed in accordance with this
Agreement.

  

 3. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative constitutes a decision of all the Stockholders and is final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders, and the Purchaser and any Indemnified Party may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders. The Purchaser is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done or omissions by the Purchaser in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser is entitled to rely, without inquiry, upon any document delivered by the Stockholder Representative as being genuine and correct and having been duly signed or sent by the Stockholder Representative.

 

 4. The Stockholder Representative will have no Liability to any Person for any act done or omitted under this Agreement as the Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and not in a manner constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Series G Holders will severally indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative from and against any Losses the Stockholder Representative may suffer as a result of any such action or omission.

 

 5. The Stockholder Representative will receive no compensation for services as the Stockholder Representative. The Series G Holders will reimburse the Stockholder Representative, on the basis of their respective Pro Rata Shares of the Net Merger Consideration, for professional fees and expenses of any attorney, accountant or other advisors retained by the Stockholder Representative and other reasonable out-of- pocket expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with the performance of the Stockholder Representative\'s duties under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Representative Expenses_ ") and none of the Representative Expenses will be paid from the Escrow Amount. 

 

 6. This appointment and grant of power and authority by the Stockholders to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this Section 11.1 is coupled with an interest, is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement, is irrevocable and may not be terminated by the act of any Stockholder or by operation of Law, whether upon the death or incapacity of any Stockholder, or by the occurrence of any other event.

  

11.2 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be given by: (a) personal delivery or by

11.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified except in a written document signed by each party to be
bound by the amendment and that identifies itself as an amendment to this
Agreement. Any amendment of this Agreement signed by the Stockholder
Representative is binding upon and effective against each Stockholder
regardless of whether or not such Stockholder has in fact signed such
amendment.

 

11.4 _Waiver and Remedies_. The parties may (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party to
this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party to this Agreement contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained in this Agreement. Any such
extension or waiver by any party to this Agreement will be valid only if set
forth in a written document signed on behalf of the party or parties against
whom the waiver or extension is to be effective. Any such extension or waiver
signed by the Stockholder Representative is binding upon and effective
against each Stockholder regardless of whether or not such Stockholder has in
fact signed the extension or waiver. No extension or waiver will apply to any
time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or
noncompliance with any covenant, agreement or condition, as the case may be,
other than that which is specified in the written extension or waiver. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right or remedy under this
Agreement or any of the documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and no
course of dealing between the parties, shall operate as a waiver of such
right or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy
precludes any other or further exercise of such right or remedy or the
exercise of any other right or remedy. Any enumeration of a party\'s rights
and remedies in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a
party\'s rights and remedies are intended to be    

 cumulative to the extent permitted by law and include any rights and
remedies authorized in law or in equity.

  

11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and
exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, or any of them, written
or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

11.6 _Assignment and Successors_. This Agreement binds and benefits the
parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns, except that the Company may not assign any rights under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. No party may
delegate any performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except that
the Purchaser may at any time delegate the performance of its obligations to
any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the Purchaser remains fully
responsible for the performance of the delegated obligation. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement except such rights as may inure to a successor or
permitted assignee under this Section.

 

11.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected or impaired in any way
and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid,
illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable
provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this Agreement,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision.

 

11.8 _Interpretation_. The language used in this Agreement is the language
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted for or against any party because that party
or its attorney drafted the provision.

 

11.9 _Governing Law_. Unless any exhibit or schedule specifies a different
choice of law, the internal laws of the State of California (without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of laws of any other jurisdiction) govern all matters arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and its exhibits and schedules and all of
the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation,
construction, performance and enforcement and any disputes or controversies
arising therefrom.

 

11.10 _Disputes_. The Purchaser and the Company (or, after the Effective
Time, the Stockholder Representative) agree to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve between themselves any dispute they
have with respect to the matters covered hereby, pursuant to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements or any agreement or document delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto, including any amendments hereof and thereof in the
following manner: The parties mutually desire that friendly collaboration will
develop between themselves. Accordingly, and without limiting any rights
hereunder, the parties will try to resolve in a friendly manner all
disagreements and misunderstandings connected with their respective rights
and obligations under this Agreement, any agreement or document delivered
pursuant hereto or any other Ancillary Agreements.

  

11.11 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California (or, if subject matter jurisdiction in that    

 court is not available, in the state courts of California located in the
County of Santa Clara, California) over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or entered into in connection
herewith or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts
(and the courts hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
in connection therewith.

  

11.12 _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the
other parties. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same
counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
